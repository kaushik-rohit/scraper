2017-10-01,"Protesters who erected a banner saying 'Hang the Tories' on a bridge in Manchester ahead of the party conference are fascists, an MP has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/hang-the-tories-protesters-are-fascists-says-mp-michael-fabricant-11062348,"Michael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Lichfield, posted a photo of the banner, under which hung effigies in dinner suits, on Twitter. He said: ""What a charming welcome to Manchester and the Conservative Party Conference. These aren't protesters, they're fascists."" It came as delegates arriving at the city's Piccadilly station on Saturday evening were greeted by an ""unwelcome party"" protest led by a choir singing anti-Tory songs. Meanwhile, Theresa May's party faces a weekend of protests in Manchester, where there is a heavy armed police presence. A national anti-austerity demonstration has been organised by The People's Assembly and a separate anti-Brexit rally is planned as part of joint action by several groups on Sunday. The banner, which has now been taken down, was widely criticised by politicians across the political spectrum. Manchester Mayor and former Labour cabinet minister Andy Burnham said: ""This is just wrong. We will always protect the right to protest but never to threaten, abuse or incite violence. It should come down."" Labour Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Northampton Kevin KcKeever tweeted: ""This is disgusting. Totally unacceptable. This isn't the USSR."" Blair McDougall, Labour's candidate for East Renfrewshire in the 2017 General Election, said: ""Good grief. The people who did this probably don't think of themselves as extremists but they are."" Labour's Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell added: ""On behalf of our city and my constituency, we're sorry about this. We disagree with and are angry with your policies, but we wish you no harm."" And shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""This is disgusting and not the Manchester I know and love. Those that do this let Manchester down."" The Leeds-based left-wing Commoners' Choir took part in the ""flash mob"" protest at Piccadilly station, with about 30 people waving ""Tories Out"" placards. Lyrics to their songs included lines like ""People often ask me what it is that makes me tick - it's Boris Johnson's head upon a stick"". Songwriter Boff Whalley said: ""It's meant in fun, but we're trying to get a serious message across with a memorable tune."" Many Twitter commentators attempted to defend the banner, claiming that the effects of Conservative policies were worse. Someone calling themselves @racybearhold claimed: ""There are 620,000 - including 180,000 children - living in deprivation in Manchester. It takes #HangtheTories banner to make you angry?"" Jeremy Corbyn supporter Simon McKeown tweeted: ""Number of people killed by the banner in Manchester: 0 Number of people killed by the Tories' policies: thousands"""

Many places will remain dry and there may be some brighter periods later. It will feel mild. Ireland and Scotland will see variable amounts of cloud with some sunny intervals. A few showers are possible but most places will be dry until more persistent rain reaches western Scotland this afternoon. Temperatures will reach around 13 to 15C with freshening southwesterly winds. This evening and tonight the rain will set in more widely across Scotland and Ireland, eventually spreading across northwest England and Wales. High rainfall totals are forecast across western hills and mountains. The rest of England and Wales will be mostly cloudy with a little rain especially across the South West. Temperatures will hold up well overnight. Tomorrow will see rain clearing to sunny skies and showers across Scotland and Ireland but the wet weather will persist for much of the day across northwestern areas of England and Wales before weakening later as it spreads towards the South East."
2017-10-01,The maximum prison sentence for animal cruelty is being raised to five years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/animal-abusers-to-get-longer-jail-sentences-11060382,"Courts have been able to sentence abusers to just six months previously, with the majority of those convicted avoiding time in jail. The increase brings the law in England and Wales in line with Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The crackdown, overseen by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, follows a series of cruelty cases in which courts felt tougher sentences were needed. One case involved a man who bought puppies in order to systematically beat, choke and stab them to death. Gangs who organise dog fights will also be subject to the harsher new sentence. Courts will retain the ability to ban offenders from keeping animals and hand out unlimited fines and community orders. Calling us ""a nation of animal lovers"", Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""We must ensure that those who commit the most shocking cruelty towards animals face suitably tough punishments. ""These plans will give courts the tools they have requested to deal with the most abhorrent acts."" The Centre for Crime Prevention and animal charities such as the RSPCA and Battersea Dogs & Cats Home called for longer jail terms earlier this year. Battersea chief executive Claire Horton had said that while just six months could be handed down in the most extreme animal cruelty cases, fly-tipping could result in prison sentences of up to five years. The RSPCA's David Bowles said the longer jail term ""should help to deter people from abusing and neglecting animals, and will finally mean that the sentence fits the crime"". Last year the RSPCA investigated nearly 150,000 alleged cruelty complaints, with 1,477 convictions secured at court and 58 of those convicted serving time in jail. The new law will come into force next year."
2017-10-01,"Legal action over an operation performed on thousands of UK women could end up being bigger than Thalidomide, a lawyer has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/vaginal-mesh-legal-action-could-be-bigger-than-thalidomide-11060083,"More than 75,000 women in England had the procedure - to implant a product known as TVT - between 2006 and 2016. The 20-minute operation is used to treat stress incontinence and prolapse, mainly caused after childbirth, by inserting a polypropylene mesh into the vagina to support the bladder like a hammock. While for many women the TVT procedure can be quick and successful, for some it has had dire consequences, leaving patients in chronic pain, unable to walk, work and have sex. The mesh is supposed to be flexible, but when inside the body it can stiffen, erode and slice through organs, including the bladder. One in 15 of those who had it fitted have had the implant removed. Up to 300 women in the UK are taking part in a class legal action against Johnson & Johnson, one of the manufacturers of the mesh, claiming the implants they were fitted with were not fit for purpose. David Golten, a solicitor at Wedlake Bell LLP, which is representing the women, said the case was highly significant. ""It is probably the most significant in terms of the number of people involved that I can think of, with the exception possibly of Thalidomide, going back a long time,"" he said. But total compensation, he claimed, could ""run into the billions of pounds, which would make it one of the largest medical cases in history"". Lesley Elder, 49, from Poole, Dorset, had the mesh fitted in 2010 after having two children. She has had 13 subsequent operations to repair the damage it caused. She is now registered disabled, is in chronic pain and survives on benefits. ""I'm not the woman I used to be,"" she told Sky News. ""I feel like a helpless no-hoper. I think I'd be better off dead. I don't want to live like this. I want my old life back."" Professor Carl Heneghan, a leading expert on evidence-based medicine from the University of Oxford, said Ms Elder's case was not unique. He said that types of mesh fitted to some women were not subjected to clinical trials until five years after they were implanted. Asked about the scale of the scandal, he added: ""I think this is the worst one that we'll ever see, hopefully, in my lifetime because I think the scale of the number of women affected is huge. ""Somehow, waves of surgeons adopted this. Waves of people were convinced that this was a minor procedure... you'll be cured immediately. At the end of the day we'll look back and see this as a real disaster."" One manufacturer of TVT is Ethicon, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. A spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson told Sky News implantable mesh was ""backed by years of clinical research"" and that ""Ethicon is confident in its products"". They said the use of pelvic mesh devices was ""supported by medical experts around the world"". The spokesperson added: ""Ethicon is defending lawsuits concerning the use of our pelvic mesh products. We are confident the evidence will show that Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the research, development and marketing of its pelvic mesh products."""
2017-10-01,A British climber saved his wife before being killed in a rock fall in Yosemite National Park.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/british-climber-andrew-foster-saved-wife-before-rock-fall-death-11060250,"Andrew Foster, 32, suffered injuries ""consistent with... granite falling on you"" when more than 1,000 tons of rock fell from the face of the El Capitan monolith in California on Wednesday. His wife Lucy was injured and remains in hospital. Mrs Foster is said to have told her husband's aunt she was only alive because Andrew jumped to save her. Gillian Stephens told The Times: ""She said: 'Andrew saved my life. He dived on top of me as soon as he could see what was going to happen. He saved my life.'"" The couple, from Cardiff, have a blog called Cam and Bear in which they describe themselves as ""passionate weekend warriors"" rather than ""extreme athletes"". The couple, who were found with climbing equipment, are thought to have been scouting the ascent from a trail when a sheet of granite around 40 metres by 20 metres (131ft by 65ft) fell from a height of around 200 metres 650ft. Scott Gediman, from the park, said: ""From what I understand they were buried under rock... they were crushed by falling rocks."" They were the only known casualties, despite being part of a group of other climbers when the collapse took place. Mr Foster grew up in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, before attending Cardiff University. She worked for clothing company Patagonia. He had proposed to his wife, who is originally from Shropshire, during a skiing holiday in the Alps in 2015 and they married last year. On Thursday, a second rock fall at the site saw one person injured. They were airlifted to hospital."
2017-10-01,You might think that it's up to aviation companies to decide how much they want to charge for their products.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/bombardier-v-boeing-how-the-battle-for-our-skies-landed-in-belfast-11054402,"You might imagine that's how markets work, but, in the world of selling planes, that's not right at all. On both sides of the Atlantic, lawyers spend a lifetime doing nothing other than working for one aviation company taking action against another. Few industries are so utterly wedded to the courts as this one. :: Bombardier ruling risks thousands of Belfast jobs Why? Well partly because there really aren't that many companies that manufacture big aeroplanes for the commercial world, so it's very competitive between the handful that do. The biggest of them is American - Boeing. The second biggest is European - Airbus. And then, some way behind, there's the Canadian company, Bombardier. If you want to understand the dynamics of this, though, you need to start in one place - the battle between the two giants at the top. In the star-spangled corner is Boeing, America's $250bn aviation giant, a company worth five times as much as Ford and General Motors put together. In the blue and yellow stars corner is Airbus, the European conglomerate that produces the world's biggest passenger aircraft. And between Boeing and Airbus is a wide ocean, and a deep well of mistrust. These two enormous companies live on some kind of a huge corporate see-saw. What pushes down one tends to drive up the other. Put bluntly, if an airline is somehow persuaded not to buy a Boeing, then it might well be getting an Airbus instead. Hence they've developed a protracted Tom and Jerry-style battle, constantly trying to hobble the other. It was only three weeks ago that Boeing declared victory in its latest legal bout against Airbus. The European company claimed that Boeing had received an illegal Government subsidy when it built a factory in Washington State. The World Trade Organisation first backed Airbus, and then changed its mind. Boeing declared victory; Airbus said it would fight on. Behind these companies sits the might of huge Governments. Both America and the European Union push the rules as hard as they can to support their own aviation industries. Building planes is one of those businesses that has an importance that spreads far beyond the balance sheet - it has strategic significance, employs highly-skilled people, and is allied to national prestige. Boeing has plans to tip its toes into the world of European manufacturing by opening a component factory in Sheffield but it is a wholeheartedly American company. Airbus has facilities in Alabama and China, but is seen by everyone as a European company. Bombardier is a smaller concern, but faces a familiar accusation - that the £740m investment it received from the province of Quebec was used to subsidise the cost of making the company's C-Series jets, allowing them to be sold into the American market at lower than cost price - effectively letting Bombardier unfairly ""buy"" a share of the market. Boeing's guard dogs woke up, snarled and sent off the writs. For Northern Ireland, there is the nervousness about jobs. When Bombardier took over the former Shorts factory in Belfast, it safeguarded livelihoods and also a rare skillbase. Little wonder that Theresa May, worried about the support of the DUP, got on the phone to Donald Trump and asked him to intervene. The Canadian Government, meanwhile, is also sticking up for Bombardier - it is said to have threatened to cancel a $5bn order of Boeing F-18 fighter jets. Aviation works like that - huge legal battles, Government interference and cutting-edge engineering. Boeing and Airbus are producing planes at breakneck speed, and both are worrying about a global slowdown that could shred demand. That's why they do everything they can to protect their markets, and why Boeing has launched its missiles towards Bombardier and Belfast."
2017-10-01,"The US is in ""direct contact"" with North Korea amid the nuclear stand-off between the two countries, secretary of state Rex Tillerson has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/rex-tillerson-says-the-us-is-in-direct-contact-with-north-korea-11061743,"Mr Tillerson said ""lines of communications"" were being used and the US was ""probing"" the possibility of more formal talks with Pyongyang, adding: ""Stay tuned."" The statement is the first confirmation that backchannel discussions have been taking place as North Korea's nuclear tests and a war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un have sparked fears of a military conflict. Mr Tillerson was speaking in China, where he is hoping to encourage President Xi Jinping to implement recently agreed UN sanctions against North Korea. He said: ""We have lines of communication with Pyongyang. We're not in a dark situation, a blackout, we have a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang."" According to the US State Department, North Korea has shown no indication they are interested in, or ready for, talks about denuclearisation. The US has not ruled out the use of force to compel Pyongyang to halt missile and nuclear tests, and last week Mr Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" the country. But privately, senior figures admit the military options do not look promising, with South Korea's densely populated capital Seoul in range of the North's artillery. Mr Tillerson has been a proponent of a campaign of ""peaceful pressure"", using US and UN sanctions and working with China to turn up pressure on the regime. But his efforts have been overshadowed by an extraordinary war of words, with Mr Trump mocking North Korea's leade ras ""little Rocket Man"" and Mr Kim branding the US President a ""dotard"". Just last month, Mr Trump appeared to rule out getting round a table with Pyongyang, tweeting that ""talking is not the answer"". Even as Mr Tillerson met China's top diplomats, North Korea's state media produced a new barrage of insults. A statement branded Mr Trump an ""old psychopath"" bent on the ""suicidal act of inviting a nuclear disaster that will reduce America to a sea of flames"". The US secretary of state suggested the key to easing diplomatic tensions was putting an end to Mr Kim's missile tests. He said: ""The whole situation is a bit overheated right now. I think everyone would like for it to calm down. ""I think if North Korea would stop firing all the missiles, that would calm down things a lot."""
2017-10-01,"Wage increases for some public sector workers will no longer be subject to a 1% pay cap, the Government has indicated.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/govt-hints-at-more-flexibility-on-public-sector-pay-11059986,"A letter from the Treasury to the heads of Britain's pay review bodies says ""more flexibility may be required to deliver world class public services"". But the correspondence, sent by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, has been dismissed as ""meaningless"" by unions, who have demanded a broader pay rise for all public sector workers. Although the letter said ""pay discipline"" would continue, it added: ""The Government recognises that in some parts of the public sector, particularly in areas of skill shortage, more flexibility may be required... including in return for improvements to public sector productivity."" Last week, letters were sent to the chief secretaries of pay review bodies for doctors and dentists, teachers, police, the NHS, the prison service, and for senior salaries. Sky's Senior Political Correspondent Beth Rigby said any rise would be costly for the Government. She added: ""To put it into context, we pay £150bn a year to public sector workers. That means that a 1% rise would cost £1.5bn - that's a huge amount of money for the Chancellor to have to find."" Unions, however, have insisted that the indications did not go far enough. GMB national secretary Rehana Azam said: ""This cynical and empty gesture shows that the Conservatives still don't get it. ""Pushing forward with slightly less harsh cuts for a small minority of public sector workers will do nothing to win back the trust and goodwill that has been lost. ""The announcement also does nothing for the low-paid majority of teaching assistants, local authority workers, police support staff and other public sector workers who are not covered by a pay review body."" Unison's head of health, Sara Gorton, said: ""This letter is piling the pressure on the Chancellor. He must now come up with the cash to deliver a decent pay rise for all NHS staff in the Budget in November."" Ms Truss confirmed earlier this month that there would be a 2% increase in prison officer pay and a 1.7% increase in police pay, demonstrating flexibility over increases for the first time. Unions have been continually demanding action on the pay cap, and motions tabled at the Trade Union Congress threatened nationwide coordinated action if changes were not made."

Several others were taken to hospital - including a man who was hit with a glass and two women who were left unconscious after being punched. Two police officers also sustained minor injuries. Police believe the fighting started in the Suburbia bar before spilling out on to the road, and say ""there is potentially a nightclub full of witnesses who we want to hear from"". Chief Superintendent Emily Higham, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ""The level of violence people were using towards each other and police was shocking and this resulted in the tragic loss of a young man's life. ""We cannot let those responsible get away with this."" Four men - two 19-year-olds, a 21-year-old and a 24-year-old - were arrested and are now being questioned.

2017-10-01,"The estimated cost of repairing the tower that houses Big Ben has doubled to £61m, authorities have said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/how-much-big-ben-repair-bill-doubles-as-elizabeth-tower-cost-reaches-61m-11059571,"The increase is due to a better understanding of conservation work originally priced at £29m, according to a House of Commons statement. Issues include reglazing Big Ben's clock face, repainting metalwork, and unexpected ground conditions around the tower. The new figure includes £45m of restoration costs with an additional £16m for risk, VAT and fire safety - bringing the total budget to £61m. The news came with an announcement that the contract for restoring the tower had been awarded to Sir Robert McAlpine, a British building and civil engineering company. The firm was awarded the contract on the basis of the increased cost estimate, a spokesperson for the House of Commons told Sky News. It had been contracted to install scaffolding and oversee pre-construction services for the restoration in November 2016. The spokesperson said the firm assessed the project and revised the costing from a feasibility study made in spring 2016. It was awarded the contracted after submitting the cost as the preferred bidder in a procurement process. ""We felt the assessment was a fair use of public money,"" the spokesperson said. ""We've been involved in the pricing process the whole way through."" The renovations to the historic clock tower caused controversy when it emerged they would require Big Ben to fall silent for four years - the longest period in its 157-year history. As well as conserving the design elements of the tower, the works aim to increase its energy efficiency, improve health and safety and fire prevention, renew building services and repair and redecorate its interior. Labour MP Steve McCabe said he was concerned about the increase in costs. ""It's quite an exceptional rise,"" he said. ""Somebody needs to get a grip on the estimates."" The Commissions of the House of Commons and House of Lords also expressed their ""disappointment in the cost increases, and the unreliability of the original estimate"". Parliamentary officials have acknowledged there were failings in calculating the cost - but say they will regularly update committees on how the repairs are progressing."
2017-10-01,Theresa May and the Tories will launch a policy blitz aimed at wooing younger voters after the opening of their party conference was hijacked by Boris Johnson.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-tries-to-woo-younger-voters-with-policy-blitz-11062359,"The Prime Minister and senior Cabinet ministers will unveil a tuition fees u-turn to help hard-up students, a boost for first-time buyers and more protection for tenants of private landlords. The moves come after members of the PM's inner circle were incensed by the latest attack on her authority by the Foreign Secretary, which came on the eve of the conference in Manchester. :: Johnson caught reciting 'inappropriate' poem in Myanmar gaffe Mr Johnson, who launched a Brexit broadside ahead of Mrs May's Florence speech last month, issued four new demands and called for an end to the public sector pay cap and an increase in the minimum wage. :: Analyst: Conservatives will target young voters The PM, who celebrates her 61st birthday on the opening day of the conference, signalled the moves to help younger voters in an interview in the Sun on Sunday. ""Too many young people fear they are going to be worse off than their parents,"" she said. ""We have listened to those concerns and we are going to act to offer a fairer deal to students and young people."" Under the Tory u-turn, tuition fees will be frozen at £9,250, with a £250 inflation rise to £9,500 planned for next year scrapped. And the amount graduates must earn before they start student loan repayments will be raised from £21,000 to £25,000, a saving of £360 next year for graduates earning above the new threshold. The dramatic climbdown on tuition fees is the most high-profile move in a Tory fightback against Jeremy Corbyn and Labour after their vibrant conference in Brighton last week. And it comes after polling evidence showed a dramatic slump in Tory supporters among voters under 40 in the general election in June and a surge in support for Labour. The Government also plans a £10bn expansion of the Help To Buy scheme, which is aimed at helping an extra 135,000 people get a foot on the housing ladder. To help give private tenants greater security, the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, who speaks on the opening day of the conference, will announce a three-point plan. ""For too long tenants have felt unable to resolve the issues they've faced, be it insecure tenure, unfair letting agents' fees or poor treatment by their landlord with little to no means of redress,"" Mr Javid will say. ""We're going to change that. Everyone has a right to feel safe and secure in their own homes and we will make sure they do."" In her Sun on Sunday interview, the Prime Minister defiantly rejected calls from her Tory critics to step down by declaring she is a woman with a mission. ""My mission is to build a better future for everyone - and I intend to show we can do it,"" she said. ""I'm not a quitter and I'm in this for the long term because there is a job to be done."" Angela Rayner MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, responding to the Tories' announcement on freezing tuition fees, said: ""The fact Theresa May thinks she can win over young people by pledging to freeze tuition fees only weeks after increasing them to £9,250 shows just how out of touch she is. ""Another commission to look at tuition fees is a desperate attempt by the Tories to kick the issue into the long grass because they have no plans for young people and no ideas for our country. They are yesterday's party. ""The next Labour government will scrap tuition fees entirely and introduce a National Education Service for lifelong learning for the many not the few. "" John Healey MP, Labour's shadow housing secretary, responding to the Tories' announcement to extend the Help to Buy scheme, said: ""This is yet another policy from the Tories that will only help the few, not the many. ""Britain is suffering from a housing crisis, with home ownership at a 30-year low and 900,000 fewer under-45s now owning a home since 2010. ""Young people held back by a broken housing market don't need Theresa May's gimmicks but the mass building programme of genuinely affordable homes to rent and buy that Labour put forward in our manifesto."""
2017-10-01,An illegal referendum in the Spanish region of Catalonia is under way despite a massive effort by the Spanish central government to stop it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/illegal-referendum-gets-under-way-in-catalonia-amid-fears-of-violence-11062371,"Late into the night, at schools in Barcelona, pro-independence campaigners camped out, many with children, in an attempt to keep the schools open to ensure they can be used as polling stations today. At the Joan Pelegri School in the Barcelona district of Sants, scores of children played in the courtyard until late. Among them we found parent Esteve Arboix. Crowds outside Barcelona school. The ballot boxes are due to be brought here from secret locations in next few hours. #cataloniareferendum pic.twitter.com/YDs8ba0z9I ""For me, as a Catalan, it's very important. It's a moment we have been waiting for for generations. And I think it's a great opportunity for us."" he said. ""I will vote yes because Catalonia has its own language, it's own culture and I think it's for the best future for our families."" :: The messy reality of the referendum Spain wants to shut down Catalan officials have now said voters can go to any polling station, not just their designated one, in an attempt to ensure people can vote even if their local station is closed down. On the orders of the central government in Madrid, thousands of national police have been drafted in to shut down the polling stations. The Spanish government's appointee in the region said on Saturday that the technological infrastructure for voting and counting ballots had been dismantled making the referendum 'absolutely impossible'. But on Sunday morning people were seen hauling ballot boxes on their shoulders into the polling stations. Speaking to Sky News from Madrid on Saturday, the Spanish Foreign Minister, Alfonso Dastis, said the vote would not happen. Crowds gathering before dawn at schools across Barcelona preparing to defy Spainish government & vote in an illegal referendum - @SkyNews 🎥 pic.twitter.com/9lwDEVjm4N ""There is no referendum. There are no voting premises. There are no ballot papers. There are no authorities to check the authenticity of the results. There may be some sham voting in some places and streets but I don't think there is going to be a referendum tomorrow,"" Mr Dastis said. The Spanish central government's assertion that the referendum is illegal is backed up by the courts and a judgement based on the Spanish constitution which says the country is indivisible. ""Democracy is not above the rule of law. Democracy is guaranteed by the rule of law,"" Mr Dastis told Sky. :: Catalonia - The fight for independence explained On Saturday, thousands marched through Madrid protesting against what they see as a separatist attempt to split up the nation. They demanded that the Catalan leaders be jailed. And in the Catalan capital of Barcelona, thousands more marched urging unity rather than independence. So far, there have only been minor incidents of tension between the two sides. Overall the campaign has been peaceful. But its not clear what will happen as police move in to prevent voting from taking place. Spain's Foreign Minister preemptively placed the blame for any violence with the Catalan independence movement. ""The law enforcement officers are there showing a lot of restraint. Any violence is not coming from them. There is harassment coming from the groups supporting the referendum. We will do all we possibly can,"" he added. In the schools, there is a sense of nervousness. ""I am not sure what will happen. I hope that everything will be peaceful,"" Esteve Arboix says. ""If police come here to block the voting, you will show to all the world what is happening. We don't want to fight. We will just try to vote. Even if you want to say 'yes' or 'no', it's just a question of democracy."" Spain's Interior Ministry claims that police have sealed off 'most' of the region's 2,000+ polling stations. However, overnight, Sky News saw a number in central Barcelona still open. The leader of the Catalan government and cheerleader for the independence vote is Carles Puigdemont. Seen as an insurgent by the anti-independence side, Mr Puigdemont is a life-long campaigner for the referendum. ""In these hugely intense and hugely emotional moments, we sense that what we once thought was only a dream is within reach."" ""We're ready to avoid either the temptation or provocation of violence,"" he said. Overnight, and reacting to images of 'More democracy' posters being ripped down by the anti-referendum lobby, he tweeted: ""This is the reality. Bothered by banners that say 'More democracy'... tomorrow we will win."""

While Michel Barnier acknowledged the mood has improved and there has been significant movement on many matters, there is still some work to be done. :: EU warns 'several months' before Brexit progress On the critical judgement of ""substantive progress"", it was a definite ""non"" from the Frenchman. And no to progress means no moving on to trade talks and the future relationship - something Britain is desperate to do. It is hard to see how a breakthrough can come any time soon (some might argue any time at all) because the sticking points are big ones. Take the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The EU 27 say it should have ultimate authority over the rights of more than three million EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. :: Unions and business leaders unite in Brexit attack The UK continues to say no - insisting UK courts should rule on matters in the UK and those concerning any EU citizens there. Neither side seems willing to budge. Mr Barnier has called it a red line, and after the latest talks said it was a stumbling block. This is why his depressing warning that it could take months before the EU can even think about opening trade deals rings true. There is no easy way around the issues for the UK. To accept the authority of ECJ after the UK exits the EU would be to diminish Theresa May's own authority in the eyes of many in her own party and many who backed Brexit in the referendum. But will that cost be worth it to secure business? Or will the EU 27 eventually accept the idea being mooted of a new UK court to settle legal disputes after Brexit, running in parallel to the ECJ with both sides looking at the rulings of the other? It would be a tough ask of the EU members who have been so firm on the issue - and for the UK it might smack of still being hooked to the ECJ in some fashion. None of this bodies well for two imminent tests of how far things have come. Next week, the European Parliament votes on whether its members think sufficient progress has been made. The resolution was put forward by the parliament's firebrand Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, who is certain himself to vote no. Given what Mr Barnier has had to say, it looks like the body of the parliament will follow. That vote will be largely symbolic - but we need to remember the parliament will have to vote on and ratify any final Brexit deal, so it's important to see the how MEPs are feeling. The second test will come at the end of next month, when it was hoped Mr Barnier would report to a European Council summit that the all-important sufficient progress HAS been made. That now seems highly unlikely given what he has just said after the latest round. The need to continue thrashing out still-contested issues will eat into the time Britain wants and needs to move on to other matters. There is a sense in many areas that things have progressed well - such as on the rights of EU citizens post-Brexit, and on the need to preserve the terms of the Good Friday Agreement when looking at Ireland and its border. But there is still plenty to battle about, and as Mr Barnier is so fond of saying, the clock is ticking."
2017-10-01,Police have confirmed that the body of a woman pulled from a lake in Cheshire was that of serving policewoman Leanne McKie.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/body-found-in-lake-is-confirmed-as-serving-policewoman-leanne-mckie-11059819,"The 39-year-old's body had been discovered in Poynton Park near Macclesfield in the early hours of Friday morning. Ms McKie was a mother of three young children from Wilmslow who had served with Greater Manchester Police since 2001 - most recently as a detective in the serious sexual offences unit. Paying tribute to his colleague, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: ""I would like to offer my most sincere condolences to Leanne's family and friends at this devastating time. My heart particularly goes out to her three young children, who she adored. ""She worked tirelessly to provide support and seek justice for victims of sexual crimes. ""Leanne was a popular figure among her colleagues, who have been left devastated by the news of her tragic death. She will be sorely missed by everyone she worked with."" A 43-year-old man from Wilmslow, Cheshire, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently being questioned by police. Detective Inspector Adam Waller said the incident appears to be isolated, and police are not looking for anyone else in relation to her death. Anyone with information has been urged to contact the police."

Baldwin had been in the African country because his Swansea-based Pro 14 league club Ospreys were due to play South African opponents Cheetahs at the Toyota Stadium in Free State's capital city. Stroke the Lion it'll be fine they said! Here's @scottbaldwin2 petting a lion like it's a pet cat! pic.twitter.com/Y95FObGeJ5 Video footage posted on the Twitter feed of former rugby player Andy Goode shows Baldwin reaching through metal bars to touch the big cat. As he strokes the animal on the head as it lays on the ground, it suddenly snaps. Baldwin, 29, is heard to cry out and pulls his arm away before a warden tells a colleague to get him first aid. The injury, which needed stitches, occurred on Wednesday during a pre-match visit to a safari park. Baldwin joked in a tweet: ""Should of know he wouldn't be impressed with me stroking his lioness before introducing myself to him first"". Ospreys coach Steve Tandy told reporters: ""There was an incident with a lion, but in fairness it was nothing to do with the lion. ""He did bite Scott but when you put your hand in a fence where there is a lion, then you will get bitten. ""It was pretty stupid on Scott's behalf and he is pretty lucky... I don't know what sort of wildlife show Scott has been watching where you can pat a lion on the head as if it's a kitten. ""It's probably one of the silliest things I've even been involved in, but thankfully he is okay and hopefully he will be back up and running in the next couple of weeks."" The club later confirmed in a statement that Baldwin had been treated at the scene by the team doctor before being admitted to a local hospital on Thursday for further treatment to prevent infection. He was due to be released on Saturday morning and is expected to travel home with the rest of the squad as planned, Ospreys said. Cheetahs beat Ospreys 44-25 in the fixture on Friday and are due to play in the league next on 7 October, in Wales."

A stadium barrier collapsed in the away section as spectators visiting from Lille celebrated the opening goal of the match by Fode Ballo-Toure. The celebrations caused a fence separating the fans from the pitch to crumble under their weight. Dozens of fans tumbled down on to the side of the pitch, crushed by fellow supporters, with police and medical staff quickly arriving to tend to the injured. The game was suspended in the 16th minute and later abandoned. Match delegate Noel Mannino said: ""In light of the events... it has been decided that the game would not resume."" Officials have said the lives of the four people who were seriously injured are not in danger. On Twitter, Amiens football club said its thoughts were with the wounded and that the stadium had been evacuated peacefully. Stade de la Licorne was built in 1999. Able to accommodate 12,000 fans, it is the smallest stadium in Ligue 1. The grounds are undergoing extensive renovation work during the 2017/18 season. One stand is closed for refurbishment, and repairs are also being carried out on the stadium's roof. Alain Gest, a local politician, has suggested the stadium was not sufficiently maintained in the past - with a safety audit in 2016 concluding that the building presented ""serious dangers""."

The man then also fell into the water and was rescued, before being arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The girl was taken to hospital and suffered a broken wrist, while the man has minor injuries. ""Thankfully the little girl will recover from her physical injuries, but the trauma she was put through is heartbreaking,"" said Superintendent Paul Savill, from Greater Manchester Police. He added: ""We have a specialist team of negotiators who always try their utmost to resolve these situations without injury and get people the support they need. ""Sadly on this occasion the man failed to engage; however, we had a second team waiting in the water to enable us to rescue the child within seconds of her entering the water. ""We will now ensure that the little girl and her family have all the support going forward, to help her make a full recovery."" The incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission - standard procedure when a person is injured when police are present."

Nick flew in from Gothenburg at 12.34pm on Thursday, with Jeremy right behind him, landing from Geneva at 12.35pm. The two brothers never flew in the same BA crew because they are both captains. Jeremy started with the airline in 1987 and Nick joined in 2012 when British Midland was taken over. ""I've done 28 years of short-haul flying. That's about 11,000 flights. It's at least 1.2 million passengers,"" said Nick. Although not identical twins, Nick said their similarity had led to the odd tricky situation. ""Years ago Jerry never mentioned to his colleagues at British Airways that he had a twin brother who flew for British Midland, and one day a British Airways pilot strode over to me at Heathrow and asked what on Earth I thought I was doing dressing up in a British Midland uniform. ""It took a bit of explaining to convince him that I wasn't Jerry!"" Jeremy, from Flitton in Bedfordshire, said he had spent a total of two and a half years flying, and joked: ""A lot of it in the holding pattern over Heathrow."""
2017-10-01,A child sex abuse campaigner is calling for a new law to protect victims from potential prosecution.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/rotherham-sex-abuse-victim-fights-for-law-change-11060231,"As a teenager Sammy Woodhouse was subjected to years of physical, mental and sexual abuse at the hands of a sexual predator involved in the Rotherham child grooming gang. Like many others in her situation she was forced to break the law by her abuser. Now she says her criminal record prevents her from making a full return to a society. ""I'm asking for the Government to put something in place stating that children, whilst being groomed to commit crimes, can't be charged,"" she told Sky News. ""I want them to recognise how many people across the country have been charged - me being one of them. I want to be able to speak to someone, have that cleared, because whilst it's on our records I feel like we are constantly being blamed for being abused."" Sammy has written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd asking her to consider introducing Sammy's Law. It could potentially affect hundreds of victims of child sexual exploitation, by removing a level of control from their abusers and making it easier for them to go to the authorities to report their abuse. It has already got the support of Bedfordshire Police Chief Constable Jon Boutcher and Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield. Mr Boutcher said: ""I think policing is about sensible, pragmatic ways of doing things. If this was a member of my family, or this was someone who I knew, I would hope common sense would prevail. ""Sammy's story is very powerful - she is the victim in this she is not the offender, and if we get more victims coming forward so that officers can go after those offenders, and get the evidence against them to put them behind bars - then that works for me."" Ms Longfield said that if Sammy's Law could be made to work, it could be of benefit to vulnerable young people who are being groomed and abused. ""The authorities and police will want to look and make sure it isn't used or abused by those who want use it to get away with offences in the past - or indeed for abusers to use this to exploit children further,"" she told Sky News. ""But with intelligent insight and a grown up look at this, and with grown up dialogue it has the makings of something very positive for children going forward."" Sammy has yet to receive a full response to her letter to the Home Secretary. However, the Home Office issued this statement to Sky News: ""Ms Woodhouse was a victim of vile abuse and she has shown tremendous strength and courage in speaking out. We will consider Ms Woodhouse's situation and respond to her directly in due course. ""Safeguarding vulnerable people is a top priority for this Government and that is why we are overhauling how police, social services and others work together to protect children and bring perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice. ""We are determined to ensure that victims do not suffer in silence and feel able to come forward to report abuse and get the support that they need."""
2017-10-01,Race car driver Billy Monger who lost his legs in a near-fatal crash has carried out a charity walk to thank the people who saved his life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/billy-monger-walks-part-of-brands-hatch-months-after-losing-his-legs-11062329,"The 18-year-old Formula 4 driver collided into another car at Donnington Park at 120mph live on TV in April. He was trapped inside his vehicle for 90 minutes before being airlifted to hospital and put in an induced coma. Doctors were unable to save his lower legs. A crowd funding campaign to aid his recovery had raised almost £850,000 with support from celebrities including Formula 1 star Lewis Hamilton. Billy, known as Billy Whizz for his speed on the track, walked the length of the pit lane at Brands Hatch in Kent on prosthetic legs paid for by the public donations. There were tears as he made his way with walking sticks, and many people shouted words of encouragement as he completed the walk on legs he only had two days to practise on. Ahead of the walk, Billy told Sky News: ""The main reason behind me wanting to do it was to make sure we get the awareness out there and to raise some money for the air ambulance, especially with all it has done for me over the last few months."" Never seen without a smile and never far from a race track, Billy is seen as an inspiration for his attitude since the crash. The young man said his life has changed since the crash but he is coming to terms with his new responsibility as a role model. ""With the support I've had, it's really important for me to spread a good message to everyone and to try and show that even if something like this happens you can still stay positive and do something with your life."" Billy says his next step is to get back into competitive racing. He's been out in specially adapted cars since but says that he sees no reason why he can't compete competitively again. ""My main aim is to get back to it and not only to compete but to be as competitive and drive to the same ability as before."""
2017-10-01,Monarch has been granted a 24-hour extension to its tour operator's licence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/monarch-gets-24-hour-lifeline-amid-last-ditch-survival-talks-11062048,"Britain's fifth-biggest airline had a deadline of midnight on Saturday before its Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL) expired. It follows a report by Sky's City Editor Mark Kleinman that Monarch's future was hanging by a thread as the company held emergency talks with regulators. This is the third time Monarch has been handed a temporary extension in four years, and sources had said that the operator's travel subsidiary was likely to be placed into administration within days if a further extension was not secured. It would have left 100,000 Monarch customers facing uncertainty about their journey back to the UK. The Civil Aviation Authority said: ""We can confirm that ATOL protection will remain available for eligible holiday bookings made with Monarch on Sunday."" The extension means holidaymakers can purchase ATOL-protected trips from Monarch on Sunday - covering them on whatever date in the future their trip takes place. The CAA has said it will provide daily updates with regards to the protection that is available to Monarch customers. Analysts have pointed out that it is unclear whether the temporary extension will do anything other than act as a stay of execution given the uncertainty about Monarch's finances. More than 2,500 people work for Monarch, with about 800 employed by its engineering business - a division which is likely to be able to continue trading under another owner. The company is expected to fly more than six million passengers this year from airports including London Gatwick, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, as well as its base at Luton Airport. Within the last week, Monarch has fielded bids for parts of its struggling short-haul business from rivals including easyJet and WizzAir as it has sought to extricate itself from a bitter industry price war. Last year, Monarch required a 12-day extension before its ATOL was renewed by the CAA, with controlling shareholder Greybull Capital orchestrating a £165m rescue package. Boeing also contributed to that deal by allowing Monarch to enter into sale-and-leaseback arrangements for a fleet of new planes, which are expected to come into service from next spring. The turmoil in the aviation industry has caused a brutal downturn in Monarch's performance, with currency weakness and a string of terrorist attacks in Europe contributing to its troubles. Insiders said that Monarch still had tens of millions of pounds on its balance sheet, which could mean that the CAA would allow it to be wound down solvently, by flying customers home from their destinations but not taking them abroad from the UK. If it does collapse, Monarch's assets would be targeted by rivals such as easyJet, although the shares of the company would be worthless. The part of Monarch's business which requires an ATOL represents only about 5% of the group's revenues, but sources confirmed this weekend that the likely loss of confidence among airport and payment partners would trigger the downfall of the wider business. Monarch's most recent financial statements revealed accounting losses for the year to last October of £317m, although much of this related to aircraft leasing contracts. Monarch's chief executive, Andrew Swaffield, reacted angrily last month to a suggestion made by Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's combative boss, that the British airline would struggle to make it through the winter."

The test took place at Cornwall Airport Newquay, and it comes ahead of a planned drive along the airport's 1.7 mile long runway on 26 October. But first, Bloodhound will need to undergo several days of tests to check its bespoke air intake, fuel and electrical systems. When it was fired up, the car's pilot sat in the cockpit - throttling the jet engine with his right foot. Stuart Edmondson, the head of engineering operations for Bloodhound, said the event was a ""fantastic ending"" to a week of testing. He added: ""Integrating a Eurofighter Typhoon jet engine into the car is a huge challenge; however, we have succeeded. ""Witnessing the EJ200 jet engine at maximum reheat is a fantastic experience. ""Not only can you see the shock diamonds and hear the deafening noise, you can physically feel the power of the engine as your body shakes."" Now the static tests have been completed, the team is focusing on what it calls ""dynamic testing"" - and preparing for high-speed 200mph trials at the end of October. The car was built at Avonmouth near Bristol - and after Wing Commander Andy Green has his first experience of driving Bloodhound, the motor will head to a desert venue in South Africa. Engineers hope it will be able to reach 1,000mph in 2018 - covering one mile in a mere 3.6 seconds. The car will be fitted with three hybrid rockets - producing 135,000 thrust horsepower when combined with the EJ200 engine. Bloodhound is the result of more than eight years spent on research, design and manufacturing."

At the UKIP conference in Torquay, the former Army officer said current rates of immigration were ""unacceptable"" - and he claimed British culture was being ""buried"" by Islam and ""swamped"" by multiculturalism. Mr Bolton argued that immigration is overwhelming public services, which have already been put under strain because of funding cuts. Calling for an Australian-style, points-based system for managing migration, he added: ""Housing and communities are being overwhelmed, it is harming our own culture, traditions and way of life. ""We must demand that our own concerns about our own British culture are heard and that feeds into our policy on immigration."" In its 2015 manifesto, UKIP had promised to enforce a temporary block on low-skilled and unskilled migration - and cap the number of high-skilled immigrants at 50,000 per year. During the last General Election, the party committed to zero net migration. On Brexit, Mr Bolton criticised Labour and the Conservatives for proposing a transition period - and he said the UK must be prepared to leave the European Union immediately. He claimed Theresa May's major speech on Brexit, held in Florence, showed ""the UK does not want to leave the EU in anything but name"". Mr Bolton, who used to work for the European Union in ""common defence and security policy"" roles, said the Prime Minister's promise of a security partnership with the EU does little to suggest that the UK is preparing to leave. He added: ""I can only conclude that the Conservative Government either has no intention of taking us out of the EU, or that they are simply too incompetent to care. ""Surely, whichever the case, the Conservatives are unfit to govern and cannot be entrusted with Brexit."" Mr Bolton told the conference that UKIP has a ""moral obligation"" to ensure that the wishes of 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit are fulfilled, adding: ""The fightback starts here, starts now, starts today."" UKIP's vote share in June's General Election plummeted to 1.8%, compared with 12.6% in 2015. In a pitch to former UKIP voters who decided to back Theresa May, he suggested the Prime Minister had betrayed them on Brexit. ""She claimed that she offered 'strong and stable' leadership,"" Mr Bolton said. ""The country and many of our supporters trusted her and the Conservatives won the election. ""So, 14 months after the referendum, have we regained control of our borders? Are we able to conclude our own trade agreements? We are not, no."""
2017-10-01,More than £1m worth of artefacts have gone missing from some of Britain's most famous museums.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/cartier-diamond-ring-among-missing-museum-treasures-worth-over-1m-11062356,"Figures obtained by Sky News reveal over 600 items have been lost, stolen or misplaced from collections including the Science Museum group, the British Museum and the Natural History Museum. The Science Museum group, which includes the Science Museum in London, Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry and the National Railway Museum in York, told us they have a further 5,315 ""unlocated"" artefacts. This means curators believe they are in storage, but don't know exactly where. The Science Museums group's deputy director, Jonathan Newby, said: ""Any object that we can't locate is unfortunate but this does come down to the record-keeping of museums. ""In the past, record collections started with a card index hand-written, then transcribed into databases that are now not what you would expect from a modern system."" The other problem is that museums don't have enough space for their collections. The Science Museum has only 5% of its 400,000 artefacts on display, the rest are kept in storage facilities. Among the items missing from the museum are an old tin of talcum powder and an old-fashioned Hotpoint washing machine. Other items lost include a rare piece of quartz from the National Museum of Scotland, an important black tie from the Imperial War Museum collection and perhaps most staggering of all, a £750,000 Cartier diamond ring from the British Museum. A freedom of information request by Sky News reveals 947 artefacts have been reported lost or missing since 2010, and £80,000 worth of objects have been stolen. But those in charge of museum security insist the systems are secure. The Arts Council head of national security, William Brown, said the figures are not cause for concern. ""I liaise nationally and internationally with other security experts from around the world. Our systems are the envy of many. The government indemnity scheme and the DCMS actually support visits to venues, and fund myself and a team through the Arts Council to ensure collections are safe."" Britain's biggest museums receive £435m of government funding every year, and all museums rely on donations from the public and benefactors. Some say they have a responsibility to improve security. Professional art recoverer Christopher Marinello said: ""It's an obligation to the public, the public who fund these museums through very high taxes, and we have a right to be able to know where our objects are. ""If there is a loss it needs to be reported to the police almost immediately so we can put the object onto a database try to find it as quickly as possible."""

2017-10-01,A 53-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of threatening to poison food in supermarkets unless he was paid more than €10m (£8.8m).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171001045404/http://news.sky.com/story/blackmailer-who-poisoned-baby-food-in-supermarkets-arrested-11061907,"Prosecutors say the alleged blackmailer had told authorities he had tampered with five jars of baby food on shop shelves in southern Germany. He also warned companies that more food would be poisoned in Germany and across Europe unless the cash was paid by Saturday. On Thursday, officials launched an urgent appeal and published CCTV images of the suspect - sparking hundreds of calls from the public. Since his arrest on Friday afternoon, prosecutors have said they are confident that the man in custody was behind the blackmail attempt. Chief prosecutor Alexander Boger told reporters that the man has not confessed to the crime, but the evidence against him was substantial. Officials have managed to track down the baby food that was tampered with, and DNA found on the jars has been linked to the suspect. The jars contained ethylene glycol, a compound used in antifreeze and brake fluid, which is toxic and fatal in large quantities. There is no evidence so far that anyone has been poisoned. Uwe Strmer, deputy chief of police, said: ""As far as the further danger of poisoned products is concerned, this has reduced the danger, but it would be too soon to give a complete all-clear."" If convicted, the man could face up to 15 years in prison for extortion. Prosecutors are deciding whether to charge him with attempted murder, which could entail a life sentence. The suspect has not been identified because of German privacy rules."
2017-10-03,"The Government will fund an extra 5,000 nurses in the next three years to meet a recruitment crisis in the NHS, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has told the Conservative Party conference.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171003231302/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-promises-to-fund-5000-more-nurses-in-next-three-years-11065134,"Mr Hunt said the commitment represented a 25% increase in the number of nurse training places every year. It comes with the NHS facing a recruitment crisis, with around 40,000 nursing vacancies across the service. Applications for nurse training places fell by around 8% this year, the first in which students no longer receive a £6,000 bursary to help fund their studies. The Department of Health attempted to reverse that trend by ""pump-priming"" the university market, spending £35m over three years reimbursing hospitals for the cost of training nurses on wards. They hope the funding will make it more attractive for universities to offer graduate nursing places, and increase the number in training from 20,680 this year to 25,850 in 2018-19. Mr Hunt also promised to expand the number of nursing associates, who do a two-year apprenticeship, by 5,500. ""Our NHS is nothing without its nurses, we need your skills, we need your compassion and with today's announcement we are backing the biggest expansion of nurse training in the history of the NHS,"" he told the conference. In a speech that stressed his commitment to prioritising patient safety and the belief that good care is also the most cost-efficient, Mr Hunt also sought to reassure staff from the EU. ""There's one group who are understandably a bit worried at the moment and that's the 150,000 EU workers in the health and care system,"" he said. ""Let me say to them this: you do a fantastic job, we want you to stay and I am confident you will be able to stay with the same rights you have now."" Mr Hunt's speech came after he was forced to reject claims from a fellow minister that the NHS was a ""Ponzi scheme close to collapse"". Justice minister Phillip Lee, the MP for Bracknell who is also a GP, made the striking comment at a fringe meeting on Monday. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation, named after the American businessman Charles Ponzi, in which money from new investors is used to pay older investors. Mr Lee appeared to use the Ponzi comparison to warn that the rising costs of healthcare and public sector pensions liabilities are unsustainable and service may not be available in 20 years. He told the SMF/Opinium fringe event: ""Fundamentally, when it comes to the under 44s, to say to them, 'Oh, by the way, we're going to tax you even more in work… because this Ponzi scheme that we've had in play for pensions and for healthcare and for social care for the past 30 years is about to collapse, so therefore we want you to work really, really hard, but when you get to 65, it's not going to be there'."" Mr Hunt told Sky News: ""Phillip Lee and I have disagreed about the health service in the past, and while I respect his work in the NHS, I fundamentally disagree with that characterisation."" Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, gave a cautious welcome to Mr Hunt's proposal: ""Significant increases to training numbers are welcome - we desperately need more nurses. ""However, they must be educated to the highest standards. We are concerned at the risk of students plugging the gaps in the current workforce at the expense of quality patient care and their own learning experience."""
2017-10-03,A man has admitted the double murder of a mother and her 13-year-old son at their home after the family took him in off the streets and looked after him.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171003231302/http://news.sky.com/story/aaron-barley-pleads-guilty-to-stourbridge-double-murder-11065522,"Tracey Wilkinson, 50, and Pierce Wilkinson, 13, were stabbed to death inside the family house in Stourbridge on 30 March. Aaron Barley, 24, who was homeless at the time of the attack, pleaded guilty at Birmingham Crown Court to killing Mrs Wilkinson and her son on the day his murder trial was due to begin. Peter Wilkinson, Tracey's husband and Pierce's father, was also attacked in the garden but survived. Mr Wilkinson said when Barley attacked him with the knife he said: ""Die, you bastard."" After he had stabbed him, Mr Wilkinson said: ""Aaron, we tried to help you."" ""There's no motive, there is no explanation,"" said Mr Wilkinson. ""My personal feeling - and this is purely my personal feeling - is that he'd lost his job, he lost his flat. ""And he decided that because his life was going bad ways he was going to take it out on the people that had cared and looked after him."" Earlier this year, Barley admitted the attempted murder of 47-year-old Mr Wilkinson. Barley's psychiatric reports had failed to provide him with the possible defence of diminished responsibility. Lydia Wilkinson, the 19-year-old daughter of the couple, was away at university at the time of the attack. Mr Wilkinson underwent a lifesaving operation and spent six days in intensive care at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after the stabbing. Speaking afterwards he said he only learned of his son's death when he woke up following surgery. The company director, who runs a safety barrier manufacturing firm, said the attack had destroyed his ""happy family bubble"". Mrs Wilkinson was buried with her son in a single white coffin at their funeral in June. Paying tribute to his wife, Mr Wilkinson described her ""as a very compassionate woman"" who ""wouldn't see harm come to anybody, she liked to help people"". He said Tracey Wilkinson had come across Aaron Barley in March 2016 when she was shopping one day at Tesco in Stourbridge. ""She came out,"" Peter Wilkinson said, ""and Aaron was keeping warm in a cardboard box and she was taken aback by this, and decided off-the-cuff that she wanted to help him"". Mrs Wilkinson took Barley to Dudley Council by car to get help and organised for him to stay at a hostel for a few days. From that point onwards she organised breakfast and dinner for him, sometimes at the family home. Mr Wilkinson said he gave Barley a job at one of his businesses in Newport in South Wales. ""In September 2016 he went off the rails. He started taking drugs and as a business we had to let him go. ""It was very amicable"", said Mr Wilkinson. ""He knew that that was the case because of what he'd been doing."" A few months later Mr Wilkinson returned to the family home in Stourbridge to find Barley asleep ""like a bundle in the corner of the drive"". Mrs Wilkinson decided that the family should help him again as he appeared to have been beaten up. Barley had Christmas dinner with the Wilkinsons and had a curry with the family three weeks before the murders. ""I dropped him off back at his flat in Brierley Hill that night,"" Mr Wilkinson said, ""and that was it for about three weeks - the next time I saw him he was sticking a knife into my shoulder"". His daughter Lydia described how she had identified the bodies of her mother and brother in hospital. ""I went in and I just stayed with my mum and brother for a while and said that I was sorry I couldn't protect them. ""And I stroked their hair. I was with my liaison officers and my boyfriend and I just stayed there because I knew that was going to be the last time I saw them in my life."""

They had been planning to travel to the holiday island for the wedding of Donna Smith, 43, and Alan Jee, 42, on Saturday and now face extra expense re-booking more costly flights to try and keep the plans on track. Mr Jee said he could not afford to pay more having already spent almost £20,000 on the wedding. He said: ""I think it's disgraceful. I don't know how they can treat people like that. ""We've got wedding planners to see, hair and make-up, bits and pieces - we can't get out there to do them. ""It's been an absolute nightmare."" The bride's son Sam Jones, 24, told Sky News his mother and her two teenage daughters had been left in tears after they learned their flight to the Canaries had been cancelled. :: What to do if you've booked with Monarch Mr Jones, from Bournemouth, said the group had already checked in and were waiting in the departure lounge. He said: ""It was kind of hard to believe. ""At first I thought it must be wrong and then I googled it and saw Sky News had posted something up roughly 20 minutes before we were told that Monarch had gone into administration. ""Then it sort of sunk in and everyone was really upset. ""My mum was in tears trying to find another way to get to Gran Canaria in time for her wedding and obviously something that's affordable for everybody because there's 29 of us in total."" He said the group was looking for somewhere to stay before embarking on alternative flights on Wednesday - with the cost rising from £120 to £200 per person. Mr Jones said: ""Mum's been looking forward to it for about two years. She's been engaged and saving up for it. ""We still don't know what exactly happened and why we were left so late to be told."" Also at Gatwick, Peter Sinclair and his sister-in-law Karen Higgs, from southeast London, had been due to fly to Dubrovnik to meet friends but were told their flights were cancelled. They were offered alternative indirect routes but could not afford the additional cost. Mr Sinclair said: ""We've lost the holiday now so we're just going to have to go home."" :: Monarch Airline collapse affects 860,000 customers Meanwhile, at Manchester Airport, Denise Parry, 51, from Salford, said she and her partner had been forced to cancel their holiday to Turkey. They found out about the cancellation while queuing and tried to book alternative flights only to be told there were no places available. Ms Parry said: ""It is so annoying, we have had the holiday booked for 12 months."" In Luton, a Lithuanian couple who had flown to London for their honeymoon and were hoping to fly on to Malaga for the second part of their holiday, said they felt ""totally screwed"".

After visiting a hospital in Las Vegas, congressman Ruben Kihuen said: ""Literally, every single bed was being used, every single hallway was being used. Every single person there was trying to save a life."" Some of those wounded were hit by shrapnel, while others were trampled on as hundreds fled the concert in panic. Currently in line to give blood in Las Vegas...this is an amazing pic.twitter.com/ibFHczBZDf Huge queues have formed outside donation centres following the pleas for blood by politicians. City mayor Carolyn Goodman was among those urging donors to come forward to fill the ""plenty of bags available"". A hotline has been set up to report missing people, as well as a ""family reunification centre"". Police have warned that identifying those killed will be a ""long, laborious process"". President Donald Trump has branded the siege an ""act of pure evil"", and security services are trying to determine whether the gunman, Stephen Paddock, had any associates. The 64-year-old fired hundreds of rounds at crowds from his vantage point on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, which was across the street from the concert venue. SWAT teams broke into the room and found him dead - surrounded by at least 10 rifles. Police believe he killed himself. The Nevada native, who lived in a two-bedroom house in the retirement desert community of Mesquite, was branded ""a crazed lunatic full of hate"" by Ms Goodman. Paddock's brother Eric described his sibling as a gambler with ""no religious affiliation and no political affiliation"" who was ""not an avid gun guy at all"" - but added he was ""not normal"". Police said there was nothing to suggest a terrorist motive, but Islamic State has said it was behind the attack. IS has not provided any evidence to support this, and the extremist organisation has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. Witness Jack Friedman told Sky News he saw the carnage unfold from the Delano hotel bar, which overlooks the concert ground. He said: ""We saw bodies hitting the ground. We saw people getting shot. ""It was so well lit up because of all the lights of the concert, you could clearly see dozens and dozens of bodies on the ground, just piled up on the ground.

The news was welcomed by environmental campaigners, who called the decision ""a victory for the environment"". Friends of the Earth Scotland said the decision to ban the ""dirty industry"" was one that would be ""welcomed across the country and around the world"". Calling the Scottish government's conclusion ""right and sensible"", they said it was necessary to ""avoid potentially devastating impacts to people's health, the climate and our natural environment"". WWF Scotland said: ""The climate science is clear. The vast majority of fossil fuel reserves need to be left in the ground. It's fantastic Scottish ministers agree that we need to start placing them off limits."" A request for public feedback attracted more than 60,000 responses - 99% of which were opposed to fracking. ""Fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland,"" said Mr Wheelhouse. ""I can confirm the conclusion of the Scottish government is that we will not support the development of unconventional oil and gas in Scotland."" But Conservative MSP Dean Lockhart said the decision meant Scotland's economy was being ""left behind"", saying that up to £4.6bn in goods and services and thousands of jobs would have been created by fracking. Mr Lockhart said: ""This much-needed economic boost and these jobs will now be created outside of Scotland, thanks to the SNP."" By using planning regulations to extend the temporary ban ""indefinitely"", the Scottish government has avoided the need to make a new law. A debate and vote will take place in Scottish parliament later this month. During the summer, clashes between police and anti-fracking demonstrators took place in Lancashire after protesters locked themselves into heavy iron tubes to avoid being moved."

Any strike would represent the first at Royal Mail since its controversial privatisation four years ago. The CWU said its next move will be decided at a meeting later this week, but insisted the vote indicated a clear feeling among members that Royal Mail bosses should step aside because they no longer have the trust of front line staff. The dispute surrounds the closure of Royal Mail's final salary pension scheme to new entrants, the terms of a replacement scheme, and also rows over pay and delivery office closures. The CWU says its list of gripes with the company are all linked to the privatisation - accusing bosses of cost cutting and asset stripping to satisfy shareholders. Deputy general secretary Terry Pullinger said: ""This ballot result is hugely significant and demonstrates a strength of feeling that can only be translated as a massive vote of no confidence in the managerial leadership of the Royal Mail Group and the direction that they advocate. ""Any sense of vocational spirit and working together with management has been lost in a climate of fear and insecurity. ""This massive failure in trust has created a breakdown in relationships and a toxic environment where working together to solve difficult problems has become almost impossible. ""The managerial leadership has failed and should resign or be sacked."" :: Royal Mail offers new pension plan to avert strike Royal Mail has insisted there are no grounds for industrial action and said a legally-binding agreement concerning dispute resolution - made with the union in 2013 - prevented the CWU from taking strike action until that process had been exhausted. The company said it remained committed to finding a deal on pensions and pay, with offers still on the table including wage increases of 5% - linked to productivity improvements. ""Industrial action is damaging for our business. It undermines the trust of our customers. It makes it harder to pay for the great terms and conditions we provide for our employees. ""National industrial action means the current offer from Royal Mail, including on pensions, will be taken off the table,"" its statement said. The company also pointed out that a strike would be self-defeating for staff as they owned a fifth of Royal Mail shares. The result was announced just after financial markets had closed for the day - with the value of Royal Mail's shares already down almost 17% in the year to date, partly reflecting strike concerns. Rival ParcelHero was quick to jump on Royal Mail's woes, warning any strike action could ""cancel Christmas""."

However, she cautioned that there may be ""bumps on the way"". The programme saw 61 flights on Monday and 58 planned for Tuesday, chartered by the CAA. No Monarch planes were used as they were leased from other companies and not owned by the collapsed airline. ""We had to beg planes from all around the world to bring everybody back,"" Dame Deirdre said. She advised customers to check a dedicated website for details and said, that if they could not find these, they should arrive at the airport three hours in advance of the flight they had been scheduled to take.

He explained that the airline carried 14% more customers in the past year, but took £100m less in revenue. Mr Swaffield said the ""root cause"" of the fall in revenue was terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, as well as the ""decimation"" of the tourist trade in Turkey.

""MGN acknowledges that Mr Coogan was the target of unlawful activities and that these activities were concealed until years later,"" a lawyer for the company said in a statement to the London High Court. Speaking after the High Court judgement, Coogan confirmed he would give most of the undisclosed six-figure sum to good causes and that the settlement provided ""vindication"". The actor, best known for playing Alan Partridge, is one of many celebrity victims of phone-hacking to have received damages from the group which owns the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People. These include former England manager Kevin Keegan, actor Patsy Kensit and former home secretary Charles Clarke. ""MGN apologises to Mr Coogan and accepts that he and other victims should not have been denied the truth for so long,"" MGN's lawyer said. The phone-hacking scandal erupted in 2011 when it was revealed that the News of the World, a rival of the Sunday Mirror, had hacked the voicemails of teenage murder victim Milly Dowler. Its proprietor Rupert Murdoch closed down the newspaper and Prime Minister David Cameron ordered a public inquiry into the ethics and practices of the press. MGN has put aside nearly £50m to cover damages associated with the hacking scandal."
2017-10-03,"Monarch has ceased trading with immediate effect, with around 110,000 of its customers overseas.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171003231302/http://news.sky.com/story/what-to-do-if-youve-booked-with-monarch-11064118,"A further 300,000 future bookings, affecting 750,000 passengers, have been cancelled. If you've booked with the airline, here is the latest information on what to do and what you can expect: :: What if you're already abroad? Those who are abroad and due to return to the UK on or before 15 October will be flown home, at no extra cost, on more than 30 aircraft chartered by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on behalf of the Government. At least 48 hours before they are due to return home, passengers should visit monarch.caa.co.uk, call the helpline on 0300 303 2800 if calling from the UK (or +44 1753 330330 if calling from overseas) to confirm their new flight details. All passengers with Monarch tickets back to the UK will be flown to the UK airports, irrespective of their nationality. There will be no online check-in. Vulnerable passengers, such as unaccompanied minors, will be given priority on these flights, while family groups will be kept together. :: Do you need to come home now? Holidaymakers have been told they do not need to cut their trip short and will be able to fly home at the end of their holiday as planned. New flights will be as close as possible to passengers' original return date and time, although delays to holidaymakers' scheduled return are described as ""unavoidable"". If a passenger's new flight departs more than four hours after their original was due to leave, they will be covered for ""reasonable expenses"" by the CAA for food and drink, phone charges and parking as long as their trip is ATOL (Air Travel Organiser's Licence) protected. Claims can be made using itemised receipts on holidaymakers' return to the UK. Those departing the day after their original return date will be able to stay in their existing accommodation or an alternative. If airport transfers were included as part of a holiday booking, they will be rearranged to meet passengers' new flights, with information provided in-resort. Those who are flown back to a different UK airport than booked will be given transport, at no extra cost, to the airport they were originally due to fly in to. Those not ATOL protected will not be able to claim for additional expenses to the CAA but may be able to claim from insurers or card issuers. If protected, an ATOL certificate will have been issued via email or post as soon as a payment for a booking was taken. :: What if you're due to return after 15 October? Holidaymakers due to return on or after 16 October will not automatically have their flights rebooked unless their trip is ATOL protected. Those who are not ATOL protected and due to fly home on or after 16 October will need to book new flights themselves and chase up a possible refund with their card issuer or insurer. :: What about your accommodation? The CAA are working to ensure those whose ATOL protected holiday bookings included accommodation will be able to stay in the same accommodation, including the same provision of meals, for the duration of their trip at no extra cost. Those who are required to make further payments for accommodation are told to pay and then claim back the money from the CAA on their return to the UK, using a receipt with a full breakdown of charges. :: What if you're yet to travel? All future holidays and flights booked with Monarch have now been cancelled with passengers told not to go to the airport as flights will not be operating. :: How do you claim compensation for cancelled flights? Those who booked flights directly with Monarch Airlines on or after 15 December last year will not be ATOL protected and will not be able to claim a refund from the CAA. They should instead contact their card issuer or insurer. Those who booked with Monarch Airlines on or before 14 December 2016 and received an ATOL certificate stating their flight is protected with First Aviation are able to claim, with the CAA currently making arrangements for refunds. Holidays booked directly with Monarch Holidays will also be protected. Those who arranged their trip through another travel company or agent should contact them directly over refunds or alternative bookings."
2017-10-03,"In a round of interviews this morning, one question kept recurring - what about Boris Johnson?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171003231302/http://news.sky.com/story/conservative-conference-danger-lurks-everywhere-for-theresa-may-11065461,"Why doesn't the Prime Minister sack him for undermining her authority? The fact the question keeps being asked is a problem in itself. Theresa May again, on Sky News, dodged the question of whether her Foreign Secretary is ""unsackable"" because of the danger he would pose on the backbenches as a rallying figure for Brexiteers. The feeling mounting in the Conservative Party is that Mr Johnson is effectively immune from being sacked. And Mrs May's allies indicate that she won't give him the satisfaction of being cast out and reinvented as a ""Brexit martyr"", if that is indeed what he wants. They seem reassured for now that by keeping him in post, he is less of a danger. His pronouncements on the EU and issues such as public sector pay are attracting criticism among MPs and his former allies in Cabinet who will, of course, have a key role in choosing the next Tory leader. Certainly, Tories I've spoken to at conference - including arch-Brexiteers - worry that Mr Johnson's interventions risk making Mrs May look weak in Europe and will simply hand opportunities to Labour. :: Sky Views: The PM can't sack Boris Johnson One of Mr Johnson's biggest critics in Cabinet is Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who accused him of backseat driving over Brexit. And she is now revealed to have hired the Conservative super-strategist Lynton Crosby to help her retain her Hastings and Rye seat at the next General Election, where her wafer-thin majority is the subject of a targeted campaign by Jeremy Corbyn supporters' group Momentum. The move will be seen by colleagues as manoeuvring for a future leadership contest, whenever it comes. There were reports already that Ms Rudd was being supported as a potential candidate by David Cameron and George Osborne following the snap election result in June, until it became clear Mrs May was staying on in Number 10. If a Tory leadership contest comes after 2019 and into the proposed Brexit transition period, it may be that Ms Rudd's vision of a Britain more closely aligned with the EU could win out. The jostling for position may be contained here in Manchester, but since losing her majority, danger for the Prime Minister lurks everywhere. The former Tory minister Matthew Parris warned in The Times on Saturday: ""This Conservative Government is finished. ""Over. Toast. Dead meat. Broken. Sunk. Wrecked. ""They can do what they like, think what they like, announce what they like, promise what they like but it's useless now, it's all too late."" The Conservatives are in Government but in the words of one former adviser seem to be in the grip of a ""crisis of confidence"". Cabinet ministers are warning Mr Corbyn and Labour's success means the battle of ideas between free markets and nationalised industries needs to be re-fought. Promising to freeze tuition fees at £9,250, when Labour has vowed to abolish them; to raise the public sector pay cap for some when Labour wants to do so for all; and put £10billion into the Help to Buy scheme, which some Conservatives privately say would be better spent on building new homes, are policy announcements that have not set the conference alight. Some MPs angrily retort the Prime Minister is focusing on what is deliverable - as responsible leaders should - while Labour just has a wish list; that voters want quiet competence rather than the promise of overturning the economic order. Mrs May defended her approach on Tuesday morning, saying that ""of course the Prime Minister is in charge"", while claiming strong leadership is ""not about having a Cabinet full of yes men"" but a variety of voices. Mr Johnson might beat a retreat from his Brexit interventions later on Tuesday - having suddenly declared on Monday night that he in fact supported ""every dot and comma"" of the Prime Minister's approach set out in her Florence speech. If so, immediate crisis averted. But for a party searching for answers, Mrs May's keynote speech on Wednesday needs to at least find a way to lift the gloom."
2017-10-03,"It is tempting to say that the collapse of Monarch Airlines, while likely to result in the biggest peacetime repatriation ever, is pretty straightforward in business terms.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171003231302/http://news.sky.com/story/why-monarch-is-the-latest-airline-to-go-under-and-more-could-follow-11064471,"On the face of it, this is little more than an over-geared company finally succumbing to its debts, as happens in many other sectors all the time. Yet there are a number of other reasons why Monarch has turned up its toes. One was the airline's weak financial position. Another is the gradual decline, since the rise of the low-cost carriers, of charter flying. :: What to do if you've booked with Monarch Exacerbating the problem for Monarch has been the litany of factors outlined by Andrew Swaffield, its chief executive, including terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, a collapse in demand for flights to Turkey, as well as the fall in sterling following the Brexit vote, which has pushed up the cost of jet fuel - which is priced in US dollars - for British carriers. Overwhelmingly, though, this is a story of what happens when supply exceeds demand which, as all economists know, is that prices come down. There has simply been too much capacity in the short-haul aviation market in Europe - which is why Monarch is the third major European airline to go under this year. Alitalia filed for bankruptcy in May and is currently in the process of being auctioned off. It was followed by Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest carrier, whose long-haul services will come to an end later this month after it became insolvent in August. And now Monarch. :: Monarch Airlines collapse affects 860,000 customers This over-capacity is a major structural issue and different carriers have responded in different ways. In the case of Ryanair, for example, it has been by trying to keep fares at ultra-low levels by running very tight schedules with little slack which, in recent weeks, has resulted in unintended flight cancellations. Ultimately, there are likely to be more airline failures, or at the very least more consolidation in the industry. How might this pan out? Dame Carolyn McCall, the outgoing chief executive of EasyJet, has just sketched out a scenario. In a presentation to shareholders last week, she said the European airline market resembled that of North America a decade ago. She noted that, 10 years ago, there were eight major airlines operating in the US and that the top four only accounted for between 40-45% of capacity. Today, the top four - American, United, Delta and SouthWest - account for 70% of the market. In Europe, at present, the top four carriers - Ryanair, EasyJet, Lufthansa and IAG, the parent of British Airways and Aer Lingus - only account for 49% of the market. Dame Carolyn added: ""This is going to change. European governments are finally coming to grips [with the fact] that they can't protect their markets from more efficient airlines, such as low-cost carriers. ""Wave one has already begun, with airlines such as Air Berlin and Alitalia that are in the midst of public sales. And this is just the beginning. ""It's going to take some time to play out, but I believe we will start to see mergers and consolidation between non-dying airlines to create real leadership positions and superior customer offerings."" :: Bride 'in tears' as Monarch collapse disrupts island wedding In this shake-out, the low-cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet have an advantage over what are known as the 'legacy' carriers like British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France, all of which are heavily unionised, have costly pension obligations and which mainly operate to and from expensive and congested airports like Heathrow, Frankfurt and Paris Charles de Gaulle. They also find themselves having to compete at one end with low-cost carriers in the European short-haul market and, on the other, in the long-haul market with the lavishly funded Gulf carriers and American carriers that, having seen their market consolidate already, enjoy improving finances. Now comes an additional threat, in the form of low-cost long-haul carriers, such as Norwegian. Only the best-managed and most adaptable will survive. IAG, whatever people may think of customer standards at British Airways, certainly looks to be up for the fight and recently began offering low-cost services on some routes out of Gatwick in head-to-head competition with Norwegian. But it is possible not all the old legacy carriers will survive. In the cut-throat European short-haul market, meanwhile, casualties are inevitable."
2017-10-03,People who repeatedly view terrorist content online could be jailed for up to 15 years under plans announced by the Home Secretary.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171003231302/http://news.sky.com/story/amber-rudd-plans-tougher-laws-for-terrorists-using-internet-11065101,"Amber Rudd told the Conservative Party Conference on Monday night that counter-terrorism laws must be updated to keep pace with modern online behaviour and to address online radicalisation. According to the Home Office, in the first eight months of this year, 44,000 URLs to Islamic State propaganda were created and shared. The new penalty would also apply to terrorists who publish information about members of the armed forces, police and intelligence services for the purposes of preparing acts of terrorism. Ms Rudd said: ""There is currently a gap in the law around material which is viewed or streamed from the internet without being permanently downloaded. ""This is an increasingly common means by which material is accessed online for criminal purposes, and is a particularly prevalent means of viewing extremist material such as videos and web pages."" Meanwhile, Boris Johnson will step into the spotlight at the Conservative Party Conference later, days after igniting another cabinet dispute over the Government's approach to Brexit. The Foreign Secretary will address delegates in Manchester this afternoon, speaking in public for the first time since he set out his four Brexit red lines in The Sun newspaper. :: Sky Views: The PM can't sack Boris Johnson He will follow three other cabinet ministers on the conference hall stage who have aligned themselves with a 'clean break' or 'hard' Brexit: Priti Patel, Liam Fox and David Davis. While Prime Minister Theresa May wants delegates to hear the government's domestic priorities - such as addressing inequality and injustice in the UK by releasing an audit of public services - Brexit has been the main focus among those attending the annual event. At a packed fringe meeting organised by Leave Means Leave on Monday afternoon, backbencher Jacob Rees Mogg attacked the Treasury for producing a ""dishonest and politically inspired"" document during the referendum campaign which warned of the economic dangers of leaving the EU. He absolved the current Chancellor of responsibility, but panellists - including former minister Owen Paterson - warned that Philip Hammond's language around the limits of an implementation period sounded ""open-ended"". In her Florence speech last month Theresa May said such a process should last ""about"" two years, while Boris Johnson said it shouldn't be ""a second more"". Sky News saw Brexit Secretary David Davis listening at the back of the hall at the start of the event, then leaving after the panel had made their opening remarks. The Prime Minister will address the conference on Wednesday, hoping to put to bed any suggestion of cabinet splits over her approach to Brexit, while pushing her domestic policies. There have been a series of announcements designed to appeal to younger voters including a £10bn extension to its help-to-buy scheme, freezing tuition fees and allowing graduates to earn more before they have to start paying back their loans. There have also been promises of a £400m boost to transport infrastructure in the north of England, while today £65m will be pledged to found an institute designed to make the UK a world leader in battery technology. But another fire was sparked at the conference when several newspapers reported remarks made by David Davis about his intention to resign. The Sun claims Mr Davis told journalists at a party on Sunday night he would quit his role on Brexit day, in 2019. When asked who would deal with the challenges of the implementation phase after he left, he reportedly replied: ""Someone else can do that, Boris can do that."" A source close to the Brexit Secretary insists he was being ""tongue in cheek""."
2017-10-03,Ryanair has said that 98% of customers hit by flight cancellations in September and October have been refunded or transferred to alternative flights or transport.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171003231302/http://news.sky.com/story/ryanair-refunds-98-of-customers-hit-by-autumn-cancellations-11065392,"The airline has faced heavy criticism after scrapping thousands of journeys, blaming an error over pilot holiday rotas. It initially said last month that 2,100 flights would be cancelled in September or October - or as many as 50 a day. In a further blow to passengers last week, an additional 18,000 flights for the winter season were scrapped. Ryanair reiterated its apology to customers in its latest trading update. Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: ""We have now re-funded/re-accommodated 98% of customers who were impacted in September and October."" He said the remaining 2% had yet to contact the airline. The update came as Ryanair published September traffic figures showing passenger numbers grew 10% to 11.8 million in September. Andrew Haines, head of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), last week said he was ""furious"" with the low-cost carrier, saying it appeared to show ""disregard for consumers and for the law"". The CAA accused the Dublin-based group of not complying with the law over its handling of the cancellations. It said Ryanair had not told customers about European rules meaning they were entitled to be re-routed by another carrier. The airline has since emailed customers, informing them of their rights to receive a refund or be transferred on to other flights or travel by train, bus, or hire car. However, it has also complained that British Airways was not held accountable in the same way when an IT meltdown stranded 75,000 passengers in May. Ryanair customers have expressed frustration after many were left out of pocket due to a lack of alternative flights and accommodation bookings they can no longer use."

Robinsons squash moved to its factory in the city in 1925. The popular brand is well known to tennis fans through its sponsorship of the Wimbledon Championships. Chief executive Simon Litherland said: ""Britvic is proud to be a British manufacturer and Norwich has been an important site for our business for many years. ""This is not a proposal that we make lightly and we know this is upsetting news for our colleagues."" Britvic said the aim was to improve efficiency and productivity and the plans would see the site close towards the end of 2019. Mr Litherland also said there would be environmental benefits and that it was part of wider changes to ensure the company had the ""flexibility and capability"" to respond to changing consumer trends. The company said affected employees would be offered support including redeployment at other sites and services to find alternative employment. Costs related to the closure will be detailed in Britvic's annual results in November. The group said it remained committed to a three-year £240m investment in its British manufacturing operations, announced in 2015."

The Nevada native targeted concert-goers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip late on Sunday night. Records show Paddock lived in a two-bedroom house in the tiny desert community of Mesquite, 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, close to Nevada's border with Arizona. :: Latest updates: Las Vegas massacre:: Las Vegas shooting: What we know so far That house is currently being searched by detectives, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo has said. His brother Eric Paddock spoke of his shock and described his sibling as a gambler with ""no religious affiliation, no political affiliation"" who was ""not an avid gun guy at all"". He told CBS News: ""The fact that he had those kinds of weapons is just... where the hell did he get automatic weapons? ""He has no military background or anything like that. He's a guy who lived in a house in Mesquite and drove down and gambled in Las Vegas."" Eric Paddock told reporters his brother was a multi-millionaire who made much of his fortune by investing in real estate. He added that his brother was also an accountant for many years, but he was not aware of any recent financial difficulties he may have had. Paddock lived in the Mesquite property with Marilou Danley, 62, records show. Ms Danley was named as his ""companion"" and police initially treated her as a person of interest in the shooting. But Sheriff Lombardo later said she was out of the country at the time of the shooting and she was not believed to have been involved. Paddock used some of her identification to get into the hotel, where he had been staying since 28 September. The suspect had a hunting licence in Texas, where he had lived for a number of years. He also had a pilot's licence, and had at least one single-engine aircraft registered in his name. Eric Paddock said his brother recently sent a a walking aid to his 90-year-old mother in Florida following the damage caused by Hurricane Irma last month. Their father, Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was formerly on the FBI most wanted list after carrying out a string of bank robberies and escaping from a Texas prison in the late 1960s. FBI agents arrested him in 1978 at the Bingo Center in Springfield, Oregon, which he had been running. A bureau poster described him as a ""psychopath"" who should be treated as ""armed and very dangerous"". Paddock is believed to have killed himself before a police SWAT team used explosives to blast their way into his room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. At least 10 guns, including long rifles, were found inside the room, Sheriff Lombardo said. He added: ""We have no investigative information or background associated with this individual that is derogatory. ""The only thing we can tell is he received a citation several years ago, and that citation was handled as a matter of normal practice in the court system."" Eighteen additional firearms and explosives have been retrieved from a house in Mesquite. Media reports said Paddock had previously lived in Nevada, California and Florida. At least 58 people were killed and more than 500 injured in the mass shooting."

Earlier, President Donald Trump made a televised address in which he described the shooting as an ""act of pure evil"" but did not make reference to a growing row over Americans' right to bear arms. Asked if the deadliest shooting in modern US history had prompted Mr Trump to consider tighter gun controls, Ms Sanders said: ""Now is the time to unite as a country."" :: Las Vegas gunman a 'millionaire investor' She added: ""Today is a day of reflection, a day of mourning, a day of gratefulness for those that were saved. ""There will be time for that policy discussion to take place but that's not the place that we are in at the moment."" Pushed further, Ms Sanders described the President as a ""strong supporter of the Second Amendment (right to bear arms)"" - adding he did not want to push through laws that would not prevent mass shootings. She said: ""If you look to Chicago where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. ""That certainly hasn't helped there, so when that time for those conversations to take place, we will look at things that can actually have a real impact."" :: First victims of shooting identified The Las Vegas shooting has reignited debate over the ease of access to firearms in the US, with Hillary Clinton criticising the National Rifle Association (NRA) for backing legislation that would relax rules over the purchase of silencers. Mrs Clinton tweeted: ""Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again."" The NRA donated $30m (£22.6m) to Mr Trump's presidential campaign - and in April, the US leader told members they had ""a true friend in the White House"". :: Urgent appeal for blood donations after attack Asked about Mrs Clinton's remarks, Ms Sanders said it ""isn't a time for us to go after individuals or organisations"". She added: ""It's very easy for Mrs Clinton to criticise and come out but I think we need to remember the only person with blood on their hands is... the shooter."""
2017-10-03,Sir Michael Fallon has signalled the UK should increase its NATO defence spending commitment above the minimum 2% of GDP.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171003231302/http://news.sky.com/story/michael-fallon-britain-must-increase-nato-contribution-to-combat-terror-11065556,"The UK is one of only six countries from NATO's twenty nine members to spend the requisite 2%. Speaking exclusively to Sky News, the Defence Secretary said: ""The threats to our country are intensifying. ""The 2% is a minimum commitment by NATO members. We've committed to meeting it at the moment... But we are reviewing the threats to our country which have intensified over the last few years so we do need to be sure that we have the resources we need so we should aim to do better. ""The PM is 100% on my page. She understands the threats very well to this country. She has been rock solid in helping us address them."" Mr Fallon wouldn't put a figure on what proportion of GDP he thinks defence spending should rise to, nor would he lay down a timetable - but this will be seen as an opening attempt to win over Downing Street ahead of the autumn budget. Currently the UK spends around £35 billion on defence - that's 2% of the country's GDP. That figure is doubted by some, however - last year the respected think tank IISS claimed Britain fell just short of the figure. The United States, Greece, Estonia and Poland have all spent NATO'S requisite 2%. President Trump has threatened to remove US support for European countries that don't increase their defence spending, saying that they can't rely on America to pick up the bill. Mr Trump has described 2% of GDP as ""a bare minimum"" and the new US Ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, used his first interview to say Britain must decide ""whether it is enough"". The UK Government is currently conducting a national security review after the summer terrorist attacks and an increasingly assertive Russia - further job cuts are widely expected in the military as a result of that process. That prospect has been further compounded by a weaker pound following the Brexit vote - many of the UK's big ticket equipment purchases are now more expensive because they are priced in dollars. The Chief of the Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach has dismissed talk of cuts, instead saying there will be ""adjustments"". In a rare briefing with Defence Correspondents last week, he refused to be drawn on the size of the budget, instead saying ""2% is what the Government has given us"". Mr Fallon will need to convince both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor who, as Defence Secretary, oversaw massive cuts to the budget after the 2010 security review."

In addition, new restrictions on chemicals will ""drastically limit"" the public sale of sulphuric acid due to its use in the production of ""mother of Satan"" - the homemade explosive believed to have been used in the Manchester Arena terror attack and the failed bomb plot at Parsons Green Tube station. The Home Secretary also outlined her intention to prevent the online sale of knives to children; to make the possession of flick knives and zombie knives at home illegal; and to invest £600,000 in new technology to remove child pornography from the internet. A series of high-profile incidents have highlighted the dramatic increase in assaults using acid in recent years, with more than 450 crimes in 2016 where a corrosive substance was used or threatened to be used. ""Acid attacks are absolutely revolting,"" Ms Rudd told Tory members in Manchester. ""You have all seen the pictures of victims that never fully recover. Endless surgeries. Lives ruined."" Meanwhile, a £600,000 spend on Project Arachnid will see the Home Office invest in ""ground-breaking technology"" developed in Canada to help identify and remove images of child sexual abuse from the internet. Ms Rudd said: ""Our investment will also enable internet companies to proactively search for, and destroy, illegal images in their systems. ""We want them to start using it as soon as they can. Our question to them will be, 'If not, why not?' And I will demand very clear answers."" The Home Secretary also detailed new laws to combat the spread of terrorist and extremist propaganda on the internet. Those who repeatedly view terrorist content online could face up to 15 years in prison, with current powers dealing with only the downloading and storing of material now extended to catch those who stream videos as well. Lengthy jail sentences will also be introduced for those publishing information about the police or armed forces for the purposes of plotting a terror attack. Responding to Ms Rudd's speech, Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""More laws to combat terrorism and violent crime won't be enough on their own when the Tories are cutting police numbers and cutting budgets,"" she said."

The three-day training exercise, codenamed Operation Border Reiver, is designed to test the response of the police and emergency services. It will last until 5 October, extending to other sites and properties in Scotland and the North East of England. About 100 volunteers, posing as casualties, lay sprawled around the grounds of RBS near Edinburgh Airport following the mock attack. They were treated by ambulance crews carrying shields and wearing body armour. The scenario involved a truck being driven into a building (represented by a tent) and the ""terrorists"" then shooting and stabbing people in the vicinity. As armed police officers arrived on the scene, the ""terrorists"" retreated inside a building containing members of the public. Groups of firearms officers laid siege to the building and the noise of gunfire and explosions rang out as the situation developed. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable, Bernard Higgins, told Sky News: ""The scenario is based on recent tragic events. We have been planning for this for about 10, 11 months now. ""As recent events have unfolded, we've changed the tactical parameters of what we're going to do. It is based on a large-scale terrorist incident where there will be a significant number of casualties. ""Exercises in the past have been based on what had happened in the past. This is probably the most current exercise in terms of the threat that we believe we will face in the UK. ""I think many years ago, the terrorist threat was pretty sophisticated. As people have seen, what we now face is pretty much low sophistication, person-borne attacks using vehicle or bladed weapons but the impact is significant. That's the broad scenario that we are testing."" Home Secretary Amber Rudd played a role in the exercise, taking time out from the Conservative Party conference to chair a COBR meeting involving ministers from the UK and Scottish governments. She said: ""The events of this year have shown why it is vital that the emergency services, Government and agencies prepare and rehearse our response to potential terrorist attacks. ""The professionalism with which front line services dealt with the atrocities in London and Manchester is in part due to the planning and practice that goes into exercises like this."""

The Ieldraan melkshamensis, named the Melksham Monster after the Wiltshire town where the fossil was found, once roamed the seas of Europe. But the fossil was acquired by the Natural History Museum in 1875 and sat in its archives for almost 150 years before a closer look found it held information about the origins of the distant relatives of today's crocodiles. It was thought that the sub-family of prehistoric crocodiles, including the new species, came from the Late Jurassic period, between 152 and 157 million years ago. But palaeontologists at the University of Edinburgh investigated further and found it was actually much older: around 163 million years. They used the monster's distinctive skull, lower jaw and teeth to identify it as a new species. Mark Graham, senior fossil preparator at the Natural History Museum, explained the long and difficult process, saying the animal was ""one tough old croc in life and death"". ""The specimen was completely enclosed in a super-hard rock nodule with veins of calcite running through, which had formed around it during the process of fossilisation. ""This unyielding matrix had to be removed by force, using carbon steel tipped chisels and grinding wheels encrusted with industrial diamonds. ""The work took many hours over a period of weeks, and great care had to be taken to avoid damaging the skull and teeth as they became exposed."" Dr Steve Brusatte, from the university's School of GeoSciences, said: ""The Melksham Monster would have been one of the top predators in the oceans of Jurassic Britain, at the same time that dinosaurs were thundering across the land."" The study is published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology."

Sonny Melton, a 29-year-old from Tennessee, was killed as he shielded his wife from bullets being fired from the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel. Another bystander, Mike McGarry, lay on top of students to protect them Stephen Paddock's gunfire. He survived, and later said: ""It was crazy - I laid on top of the kids. They're 20. I'm 53. I lived a good life."" The back of his shirt bore the footprints of panicked concertgoers who ran over his body in an attempt to find cover. Lindsay Padgett and her fiancé Mike Jay made it out of the concert area, only to immediately return to their scene with their pickup truck. The couple drove those in desperate need of medical care to nearby hospitals. Los Angeles firefighter Robert Hayes helped his wife and four friends to safety when the attack began.

I'm a hunter and a sportsman but No body needs these weapons. There's a middle ground here let's get to the table and find it.

He said he was a ""hunter and sportsman"" but that no one ""needs these weapons"". The 39-year-old, who is married to actress Mila Kunis, with whom he has two children, added: ""All prayers to the victims of this devastating loss of love, life, and innocence.""

The former Army officer suffered serious injuries after spinning thousands of feet to the ground at Wiltshire's Netheravon Airfield in April 2015. The 40-year-old's main and reserve parachute both failed. Cilliers is also charged with damaging a gas valve at the couple's home a few days earlier as part of the second alleged murder attempt. Prosecutor Michael Bowes told Winchester Crown Court that Cilliers had lied to his Tinder lover Stefanie Goller - telling her that he was going to leave his wife because she had an affair, and he was not the father of one of their children. The defendant was £22,000 in debt and believed he would get a £120,000 insurance payout when she died, the court heard. He was also in a sexual relationship with his ex-wife, Carly Cilliers. Mr Bowes described Victoria Cilliers as a ""highly experienced parachutist and parachute instructor"", adding: ""Those attending at the scene expected to find her dead, although she was badly injured, almost miraculously she survived the fall. ""Those at the scene immediately realised that something was seriously wrong with her reserve parachute, two vital pieces of equipment which fasten the parachute harness were missing. ""Their absence inevitably meant the reserve parachute would fail and would send her spinning to the ground."" Mr Bowes described how police went on to investigate the circumstances surrounding a gas leak at the couple's home a few days before. The prosecutor told jurors that Cilliers had caused it deliberately ""just before he left the house to stay elsewhere"". Following the leak, Victoria Cilliers had sent a WhatsApp to her husband, and jokingly said: ""Are you trying to kill me?"" Her husband replied: ""Seriously, why are you saying that?"" Mr Bowes told the court: ""That prescient WhatsApp message turned out to be true."" Within hours of that failed attempt, Mr Bowes added, the defendant suggested to his wife that they go parachuting. Cilliers, of Aldershot, Hampshire, denies all the charges and the case continues."
2017-10-04,"Brexit means that everything is in delicate equilibrium.

It was no mean feat to get to this point. But the PM has been stymied by her own Foreign Secretary. The whole point of the Florence speech was to take the sting out of conference by stabilising the position on Brexit in advance. Boris Johnson interrupted that process before the Florence speech and before conference too, setting new red lines on the day she was actually dining with the EU27 leaders in Tallinn. In the eyes of European diplomats, the question they now ask is: can the PM deliver what she brings to the negotiation table in October and December at the EU summits? In that regard, it seems clear she had been undermined by her own chief diplomat, at an extremely sensitive time. She did not engage with the point. ""I think leadership isn't just about being surrounded by Yes Men - having people with different views. There's a lot of focus about the Foreign Secretary's job, other people's job - what the public wants us to do is focus not about our jobs but their jobs...Boris was part of Cabinet that agreed the position of Florence speech and that's the position we take into the negotiations and we take forward with other EU leaders,"" the PM told me on the top floor of a Manchester hotel with views of the Pennines behind us. She has spent a huge amount of her time talking about Boris. She handled the questions with courtesy and care but there was clearly huge frustration in her voice. What the PM really wanted to do, as many Cabinet ministers have, is talk about and attack the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn. The PM sees herself in the vanguard of a new battle with a foe she thought had been defeated - the hard left. She will claim she can deliver changes that heal a divided society, and Jeremy Corbyn will make lots of promises ""he can't deliver"". Expect to hear a lot about a ""balanced approach"" to the economy. Boris Johnson obliged with a vow of loyalty in the Hall as he implored the party to let the British lion ""roar"". But there was something of the whimper in the voice of this tamed big cat. It got his faithful going. But it did not ring true with a deeply angry Cabinet, who criticised his antics. ""We are past Peak Boris,"" said one, and another warned that there was no point having him in the tent if he was going to ""pee all over the floor"". Still peace reigned briefly, until the Foreign Secretary decided to make jokes about ""clearing bodies"" away from war torn Libya to turn it into the ""next Dubai"". Two backbench MPs - Anna Soubry and Heidi Allen - called for the Foreign Secretary to be sacked hours before the finale of this conference. This was party panto that we saw in Labour last year, now transferred to the Conservatives. It would be bad enough at any time. But it happens to come at the precise time that the country needs the Governing party to present a credible, unified and clear face externally in the Brexit negotiation. All this melodrama, and we have not yet got to agreeing within Cabinet what final deal we will ask for, let alone what deal can be negotiated with the rest of the EU. And the precarious balance left by this conference has to survive first contact with an EU Summit in nine days."

First, she was handed a P45 by the comedian Simon Brodkin - who plays a character called Lee Nelson - and told it was from Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary. :: As it happened: P45 prank mars PM speech Mrs May took the disturbance in her stride, saying: ""I'll tell you who I'd like to give a P45 to and that's Jeremy Corbyn"", before the comedian was escorted out of the hall by security. But the Prime Minister, who did a round of several dozen radio and TV interviews yesterday before attending party receptions, had a bad cough and struggled through much of the rest of her hour-long speech, her voice weakening noticeably towards the end. The key announcement was her long-promised cap on energy bills, the Prime Minister announcing that a draft bill would be passed next week to ""end rip-off energy prices once and for all"". :: What is a P45? Also in the speech was a pledge that the Prime Minister would make housing her personal ""mission"" in office, and that the Government would put £2bn into affordable homes which councils and housing associations could bid for. Mrs May began her speech with a fulsome apology for an election campaign which had been ""too scripted, too presidential"" and had allowed Labour to paint the Conservatives as the party of continuity rather than change. She finished with a passage which could have been tailor-made for her unexpectedly disappointing performance. She said: ""The test of a leader is how you respond when tough times come to you. *coughs* pic.twitter.com/1b6CoW5Mrz ""When faced with challenge, if you emerge stronger.

But in more bad luck, as she finally reached the closing sections of her speech, the stage backdrop began to fall apart, with the letter ""F"" in the Conservative slogan ""Building a Country that works for Everyone"" falling off. :: Boris Johnson: Attention seeker extraordinaire? Mrs May said what drove her in politics was the desire to tackle injustice - whether calling the Hillsborough inquiry or getting justice for victims of child sexual abuse or helping get to the truth of what happened at Grenfell Tower. But she defined the ""British dream"" for most people as the prospect that ""their children will do better than themselves"". Cabinet ministers tried to put a brave face on the performance. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""Despite that nagging cough, which I'm sure made her come across as very human - in fairness, in not quite the way she's planned it - there was some real policy substance."" Today's use of 'You've Got The Love' at the Conservative party conference was not approved by us nor would it have been had they asked.

She had earlier called on the party faithful to ""defend free and open markets with all our might"". But the PM said: ""We will always take on monopolies and vested interests when they are holding people back... the energy market punishes loyalty with higher prices and the most loyal customers are often those with lower incomes - the elderly, people with lower qualifications and people who rent their homes. ""Those who, for whatever reason, are unable to find the time to shop around. ""That's why next week this Government will publish a draft bill to put a price cap on energy bills, meeting our manifesto promise and bringing an end to rip-off energy prices once and for all."" :: Energy bills: are standard tariffs a rip-off? The pledge, warmly welcomed by consumer groups, was later tempered by a spokesperson who said the draft bill would only be introduced if the industry's regulator, Ofgem, failed to act. A failure to switch means almost half of UK households still remain on standard variable tariffs (SVTs) - often the most expensive type of energy bill as customers default to them when fixed-cost deals expire. There are 12 million homes currently on SVTs. The regulator has moved to improve switching rates as part of industry reforms - with more than three million consumers switching their supplier or account last year. But critics have accused it of only giving help on the cost of bills to vulnerable customers. An Ofgem spokesman said: ""We share the Government's concern that the market is not working for all consumers, especially the vulnerable, and will work with the Government on their plans announced today to better protect consumers on poor value deals."" Mrs May's announcement was enough to send shares in Centrica - the parent company of British Gas - down to 14-year lows on the FTSE 100 at one stage, closing 6.1% lower. Fellow member of the so-called ""Big Six"" SSE - also a constituent of the FTSE 100 - saw its shares fall by more than 3%. The company said in response: ""SSE will look carefully at what is proposed by Government and detailed consultation is required to help avoid any unintended consequences. ""SSE believes in competition not caps, so if there is to be any intervention it should be simple to administer, time-limited, and maintain the principles of a competitive energy market to best serve customers' interests."" Two of the other biggest firms, E.ON and ScottishPower, have argued that standard tariffs should be scrapped, not capped. The CBI's director-general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said: ""Today's announcement is an example of state intervention that misses the mark. ""Market-wide price caps are not the best answer. Suppliers are already acting, providing support to those on pre-payment meters, and continued action to phase out standard variable tariffs would benefit a wide range of consumers, including those on the lowest incomes."" But Energy Secretary Greg Clark told Sky News: ""What the competition authority has established is that the energy market is not working well. ""There are two markets in effect - there is a highly competitive market for people who are very keen to go on the internet and switch. But there are a lot people who might trust brands that they've known for years. ""They assume they may not get the lowest price, but they won't be ripped off. A lot of people see themselves as loyal customers and because the companies know that they are loyal and that they can put up the prices and they have made a misjudgement, that they won't do anything about it, they are overcharging them to this amount. ""I think when you are faced with that evidence, I think you have got a duty to act."""

A Conservative spokesman said: ""In light of the arrest during the Prime Minister's speech we are working with the police to review the accreditation process and security arrangements for party conference."" Mr Brodkin, who has a history of interrupting high-profile events, was arrested ""to prevent a breach of the peace"" after being escorted out of the conference hall, but was later released. He was revealed to have had legitimate accreditation for the Conservative conference, believed to be a two-day delegate pass costing around £700. Greater Manchester Police chief superintendent John O'Hare said: ""The man had legitimate accreditation which granted him access to the conference site. ""In light of this we will be reviewing the accreditation process with the Conservative Party. ""Even with accreditation, everyone at the conference goes through airport-style searches before being allowed entry to the site."" Security firm G4S defended themselves, using their Twitter account to reveal they were not the security provider for inside the auditorium but only the conference perimeter, entrances and exits. Mr Brodkin was given a conditional caution in March 2013 after warming up alongside Premier League footballers ahead of a Manchester City game at Everton. He was also arrested, but later released, when he threw money at world football boss Sepp Blatter in July 2015.

2017-10-04,"The girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock had no idea he was planning violence, according to her lawyer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/las-vegas-gunmans-girlfriend-knew-nothing-about-planned-violence-lawyer-11067416,"Marilou Danley has been questioned by the FBI after being met by investigators on her return to the US from the Philippines. Her lawyer Matthew Lombard spoke in Los Angeles where she had arrived after flying from the far east where she had been visiting family. While she was there, Paddock shot dead 58 people at a country music festival and injured hundreds more when he fired upon a crowd from a hotel window in the Nevada city. It emerged on Wednesday that Paddock may have been intending to target a different festival a week earlier and also had a greater quantity of ammunition than first thought. :: Guns modified to 'inflict carnage' before attack Ms Danley issued a statement after reports emerged that her boyfriend had wired $100,000 to the Philippines while she was abroad. She said she was initially pleased when he wired her the cash to buy a house for her family, but later feared it was a way to break up with her. ""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone,"" Ms Danley said in the statement read by Mr Lombard. :: Victims of the Las Vegas shooting ""He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen."" She said she knew him ""as a kind, caring, quiet man"". Ms Danley, who is classed as a ""person of interest"", spoke with the FBI for several hours as the investigators' struggled to establish a motive for Paddock. She lived with the former accountant at his retirement community home in Mesquite, Nevada - where officials searching the property have found a number of weapons. :: The worst mass shootings in US history She was born in the Philippines, and is an Australian citizen. Footage reportedly showed the 62-year-old woman being taken in a wheelchair at LAX while flanked by uniformed police officers. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, said he was ""absolutely"" confident authorities would find out what was behind the worst mass shooting in modern US history. Ms Danley's sisters have said they believe she was ""sent away"" so she could not interfere with her boyfriend's plan to open fire on thousands of people in the massacre. :: Paddock 'extensively planned' massacre One said: ""I know that she doesn't know anything as well like us. She was sent away. She was away so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning."" Speaking to Seven News in Australia, the women said they were in complete shock to discover their sister had arrived in the Philippines two weeks ago. :: Why shares in gun firms rose after Vegas horror One of them said Ms Danley was ""a good person"" who would have stopped Paddock if she had been there. They also claimed Ms Danley had been sent $127,000 (£95,000). Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters Paddock rented a room through Airbnb in The Ogden building, in the downtown area of Las Vegas, which overlooked the site of a music festival that was taking place at the same time, between 22 and 24 September. The Life is Beautiful festival featured Muse, Gorillaz, The XX, Lorde and Chance the Rapper. It also emerged that the gunman had 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 50lbs of the explosive Tannerite in his car but it was not known what they were to be used for. A clarified timeline was also provided, with police saying the shooting began at 10.05pm and finished 10 minutes later, but it was not until 11.20pm when the first police entered his room. At some point he shot 200 rounds into the hallway when a security guard approached, leaving him with an injured leg."
2017-10-04,Facebook could face fresh allegations that it doesn't pay enough tax after annual results showed its UK business has swung back into profit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/facebook-uk-posts-58m-profit-but-pays-just-26m-tax-11066802,"The company's turnover quadrupled to more than £840m in the year to 31 December, with pre-tax profits of £58.4m. Despite this, Facebook UK listed its corporation tax liability for the calendar year as just £5.1m, less than 10% of its profit. Part of that sum will be paid now, and part in the coming months. But once tax credits and deductible expenses were applied, Facebook UK only paid £2.58m in tax for the calendar year of 2016. The social network's remarkable rise in revenue is a result of advertising spend by big British companies now being accounted for by the UK business, instead of being funnelled through its Irish arm. Facebook UK's tax payment of £2.58m represents about 4.4% of its total pre-tax profit, and about 0.3% of its turnover. The company's figures also reveal that it employed an average of 960 people during 2016, with a total wage bill of just over £104m. That suggests that the average employee of Facebook UK is paid more than £108,000, before any bonuses are taken into account. However, that figure has actually fallen since 2015, when the average salary was over £114,000. This suggests that the rapid expansion of the company's sales team has seen people being recruited on slightly less generous salaries. If those figures seems high, it's worth remembering that pay given to the directors of Facebook UK are not included in those statistics - they are all paid through other Facebook companies. The company also paid out nearly £78m in share-based payments. These results will add to the scrutiny that is now routinely paid on the tax paid by giant international technology companies. By coincidence, Facebook UK's company results came out on the same day that Amazon was being upbraided for an illegal tax agreement with Luxembourg. Meanwhile, Ireland has been told it will be taken to court for its failure to pursue Apple for €13bn (£11.5bn) of unpaid tax."

Britain's fifth-biggest airline has also been accused of failing to give notice or statutory pay. The pilots union, Balpa, said it was planning action too over ""shabby"" treatment of its members. The loss of 1,858 of 2,100 roles was confirmed by administrators on Monday evening - 14 hours after the shock announcement that Monarch had ceased trading with approximately 860,000 customers affected. Of 110,000 stranded abroad, a charter operation to repatriate them resulted in 119 flights bringing 23,000 passengers home on Monday and Tuesday alone. It is believed 30% of those affected will have taken a free flight back to the UK by Wednesday night. Unite national officer Oliver Richardson said: ""While, understandably, a lot of the focus is on passengers, Unite is determined to ensure that Monarch workers, who worked so hard to try and turn the airline around, are not left high and dry. ""The manner in which Monarch went into administration and the way the Government allowed it to happen means there is a strong claim for compensation by former Monarch workers."" Under UK law, companies with more than 100 employees must give at least 45 days' notice of their intention to make people redundant - and Unite says employees with more than two years' service should receive redundancy pay. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of Balpa, has described the treatment of Monarch's pilots as ""unbelievably cold hearted"". The pilots' union has claimed some of its members were left with a phone bill of almost £40 after being asked to call a premium-rate phone number to join a conference call in which their redundancies were announced. Monarch's administrator has since promised to reimburse those affected. Mr Strutton said: ""Not only were they given no warning of this situation but some have had to shell out their own cash to be told they've lost their job."" Administrator KPMG said treatment of staff was one of its ""utmost priorities"" as it assumed responsibility for Monarch Travel Group and Monarch Airlines at 4.30am on Monday. It said representatives held a series of meeting with staff aimed at ensuring they receive the compensation they are entitled to. A spokesperson added: ""Since then, the administration and Monarch HR teams have continued to work hard to ensure that all employees receive any information and support they need. ""Additionally, a number of the Monarch HR team have been retained to hold jobs fairs and similar activity over the coming days and weeks to try to get as many people as possible back in to work as soon as possible."""

This is a higher level than in a McDonald's burger, the campaign group said, and also makes the sauces 30% saltier than seawater. It is also an increase since they products were last reviewed in 2009, despite an ongoing health campaign to reduce levels in grocery products. None of the branded pesto sauces included in the survey had the Department of Health's recommended colour-coded nutrition label, ""despite some of these products being the worst offenders when it comes to salt"", the group said. The study found Napolina Green Pesto with Basil, Gino D'Acampo Pesto alla Genovese and Truly Italian Genovese Basil Pesto all contained between 2g and 2.5g of salt per 100g. Tesco Reduced Fat Red Pesto, Aldi's Specially Selected Italian Pesto Genovese and Italian Pesto Rosso, Jamie Oliver Green Pesto and Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Pesto Alla Genovese all contained less than 1g of salt per 100g. The research group has called on Public Health England to ""act tough"" following the findings. CASH campaign manager Sonia Pombo told Sky News: ""It's not compulsory, it's a voluntary campaign, it's a voluntary target that these companies have been asked to follow, with very little monitoring being carried out by Public Health England. ""And there are no sanctions being done if they don't follow the rules so unfortunately quite a few companies aren't taking it as seriously as we'd like. ""The campaign's been going on for well over 10 years now, we have seen some very good improvements but not enough and it's slowing down now."" CASH chairman Graham MacGregor branded the findings a ""national scandal"" as Sacla insisted it made products to be incorporated within a ""balanced diet"". PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone insisted the body had been ""very clear"" and called for manufacturers not to be ""complacent""."
2017-10-04,A homeless man who murdered a mother and her 13-year-old son after the family took him in off the streets has been jailed for at least 30 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/homeless-aaron-barley-jailed-for-killing-mother-and-son-who-took-him-in-11066690,"Aaron Barley was told he ""may never be released"" as he was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court for the murders of Tracey Wilkinson, 50, and her 13-year-old son Pierce at their home in Stourbridge, in the West Midlands. The 24-year-old admitted stabbing Mrs Wilkinson 17 times with a kitchen knife as she was in bed, and Pierce Wilkinson eight times, but had ""shown no remorse"" for his actions, the court heard. In fact, judge Mrs Justice Carr said, Barley had at times following the killings shown ""satisfaction in what you did achieve"". Mrs Wilkinson first spotted Barley sleeping in a cardboard box outside a Tesco supermarket in Stourbridge in March 2016, and decided she wanted to help him. She and her husband Peter, 47, arranged for him to stay at a hostel for a few days and Mr Wilkinson, a company director who runs a safety barrier manufacturing firm, also gave him a job at one of his businesses in Newport in South Wales. Barley occasionally had breakfast and dinner at the family home, but later started taking drugs and lost his job as a result. Mr Wilkinson returned home one day, several months later, to find Barley asleep ""like a bundle in the corner of the drive"" and the family decided to help him again. Barley had Christmas dinner with the family and ate a curry with them three weeks before carrying out the ""vicious and unprovoked attack"" on 30 March, when he broke into the house, disguised in black, in the early hours. The court heard details of warning signs in the months and weeks before the murders, including death threats and a post on Facebook which said: ""I've got to go and try and get some help before I go on a killing spree."" Mr Wilkinson, who was at home on the night, was also attacked, but survived the brutal assault. Daughter Lydia Wilkinson, 19, was away at university at the time. Sentencing Barley, Mrs Justice Carr told him: ""You abused your knowledge of the family home, which you had only gained through the Wilkinsons' extraordinary kindness and generosity to you. ""You knew that you were destroying the family. It is what you intended."" The judge described ""chilling"" security camera footage, recovered from the family home, showing Barley ""crawling"" on all fours around the Wilkinsons' back garden moments before launching the ""violent and sustained assault, involving severe force"". She told Barley he ""clearly"" represented a ""very significant risk of serious harm to members of the public"" and sentenced him to a minimum term of 30 years in jail, but decided not to impose a whole-life tariff because of his age."
2017-10-04,"Tesco boss Dave Lewis hailed ""strong progress"" as the firm reported a sharp rise in first-half profits to £562m and resumed dividend payments, in the latest sign of its turnaround.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/tesco-first-half-profits-surge-but-sales-growth-stutters-11066490,"Britain's biggest supermarket said its performance had been helped by holding back the scale of price increases compared to rivals in the face of inflationary pressure in a ""challenging"" market. However, interim results for the six months to 26 August showed UK sales growth stuttering, slipping to 2.1% in the second quarter compared to 2.3% in the previous three months. Shares in the FTSE 100 giant opened 2% higher after the results were announced on Wednesday though they later turned negative, along with rivals Sainsbury's and Morrisons, closing 3.2% down. The half-year profit figure for Tesco was nearly eight times the £71m reported in the same period last year, when the company was hit by a series of one-off costs. But even on the company's preferred headline measure stripping out these items, earnings rose 27%. The performance was enough for Tesco to announce that it would resume dividends to shareholders for the first time since the 2014/15 financial year, with a 1p pay-out. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the business was ""continuing to make strong progress"". He added: ""Our offer is more competitive and more customers are shopping at Tesco. ""Today's announcement that we are resuming our dividend reflects our confidence that we can build on our strong performance to date."" Mr Lewis, a former Unilever executive, was appointed three years ago after a period in which Tesco suffered sliding sales and profits. The latest figures are likely to be seen as another milestone as he leads the business to recovery amid fierce competition with rivals, in a market that has been shaken up by the advance of discounters Aldi and Lidl. At the same time, retailers face a battle to maintain competitive prices at a time when their import costs have been rising sharply following the fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote. Tesco said: ""Market conditions have been challenging with inflationary pressure being felt throughout the half, but we have worked hard with our supplier partners to minimise price increases for customers. ""Our overall sales inflation in the half was around 1% less than the rest of the market, helping us become even more competitive."" Tesco highlighted the performance of its fresh food ranges, saying it was outperforming the market in that area, and also said it was scaling back short-term price promotions in household and general merchandise categories. It has also been slashing costs as part of a drive to save £1.5bn. Mr Lewis acknowledged it had been a ""testing time"" for staff after the company axed 1,200 head office roles and closed its Cardiff call centre, with the loss of 1,100 jobs. But he said the head office restructuring was now ""behind us"" and that the business had increased the number of customer-facing store staff. The results come as Tesco awaits the findings of an in-depth probe by the Competition and Markets Authority into its planned £3.7bn takeover of wholesale giant Booker. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There's not many things more telling about the health of company than its ability to pay a dividend, and Tesco's return to the register after a three-year hiatus speaks volumes about the progress the company has made."""

2017-10-04,"Royal Mail staff have voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favour of strike action, with a union not ruling out the prospect of national walkouts in the run-up to Christmas.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/royal-mail-staff-back-national-strike-in-pay-and-pension-dispute-11065812,"The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said a ballot of 110,000 staff had a turnout of 73% - with 89% of voters backing industrial action. Any strike would represent the first at Royal Mail since its controversial privatisation four years ago. The CWU said its next move will be decided at a meeting later this week, but insisted the vote indicated a clear feeling among members that Royal Mail bosses should step aside because they no longer have the trust of front line staff. The dispute surrounds the closure of Royal Mail's final salary pension scheme to new entrants, the terms of a replacement scheme, and also rows over pay and delivery office closures. The CWU says its list of gripes with the company are all linked to the privatisation - accusing bosses of cost cutting and asset stripping to satisfy shareholders. Deputy general secretary Terry Pullinger said: ""This ballot result is hugely significant and demonstrates a strength of feeling that can only be translated as a massive vote of no confidence in the managerial leadership of the Royal Mail Group and the direction that they advocate. ""Any sense of vocational spirit and working together with management has been lost in a climate of fear and insecurity. ""This massive failure in trust has created a breakdown in relationships and a toxic environment where working together to solve difficult problems has become almost impossible. ""The managerial leadership has failed and should resign or be sacked."" :: Royal Mail offers new pension plan to avert strike Royal Mail has insisted there are no grounds for industrial action and said a legally-binding agreement concerning dispute resolution - made with the union in 2013 - prevented the CWU from taking strike action until that process had been exhausted. The company said it remained committed to finding a deal on pensions and pay, with offers still on the table including wage increases of 5% - linked to productivity improvements. ""Industrial action is damaging for our business. It undermines the trust of our customers. It makes it harder to pay for the great terms and conditions we provide for our employees. ""National industrial action means the current offer from Royal Mail, including on pensions, will be taken off the table,"" its statement said. The company also pointed out that a strike would be self-defeating for staff as they owned a fifth of Royal Mail shares. The result was announced just after financial markets had closed for the day - with the value of Royal Mail's shares already down almost 17% in the year to date, partly reflecting strike concerns. Rival ParcelHero was quick to jump on Royal Mail's woes, warning any strike action could ""cancel Christmas""."
2017-10-04,Britain's economic growth looks set to show little sign of improvement in the third quarter despite a slight bounce-back in the dominant services sector last month.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-growth-set-to-remain-subdued-in-third-quarter-11066630,"Figures from the IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) point to gross domestic product increasing by 0.3% in the July-September period, the same pace as that seen earlier in the year. Services PMI data for September gave a reading of 53.6, up from an 11-month low of 53.2 in August - on a measure where the 50-mark separates growth from contraction. Separate figures earlier this week suggested the construction sector shrinking while manufacturing growth, though still robust, had slowed. But it is the services data that is the most significant to overall growth as the sprawling sector - ranging from bars and restaurants to law firms and accountants - represents nearly four-fifths of the UK's economic output. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ""The three PMI surveys put the economy on course for another subdued 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, but the fourth quarter could see even slower growth."" He said across all three sectors, new business was the weakest since last summer while optimism slipped and higher costs were passed on to customers - likely to drive inflation higher. ""The surveys therefore portray an economy struggling with the unwelcome combination of sluggish growth and rising prices,"" Mr Williamson said. In the services sector, firms cited Brexit-related uncertainty and worries about the economy as reasons for their gloomier mood. Mr Williamson said the Bank of England faced a dilemma as, while inflationary pressures would add to the likelihood of an interest rate hike, the tepid economic performance would normally be associated with easier monetary policy. James Smith, economist at ING Bank, said: ""The latest UK service sector data is unlikely to deter the Bank of England from hiking in November, but we think any tightening thereafter could be limited."" Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The rise in September's services sector PMI will help assuage fears that the economy is losing momentum, but it suggests that growth struggled to pick up pace in Q3."""

They then used knives and automatic weapons to ""inflict"" mass casualties. The three-day training exercise, codenamed Operation Border Reiver, is designed to test the response of the police and emergency services. It will last until 5 October, extending to other sites and properties in Scotland and the North East of England. About 100 volunteers, posing as casualties, lay sprawled around the grounds of RBS near Edinburgh Airport following the mock attack. They were treated by ambulance crews carrying shields and wearing body armour. The scenario involved a truck being driven into a building (represented by a tent) and the ""terrorists"" then shooting and stabbing people in the vicinity. As armed police officers arrived on the scene, the ""terrorists"" retreated inside a building containing members of the public. Groups of firearms officers laid siege to the building and the noise of gunfire and explosions rang out as the situation developed. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable, Bernard Higgins, told Sky News: ""The scenario is based on recent tragic events. We have been planning for this for about 10, 11 months now. ""As recent events have unfolded, we've changed the tactical parameters of what we're going to do. It is based on a large-scale terrorist incident where there will be a significant number of casualties. ""Exercises in the past have been based on what had happened in the past. This is probably the most current exercise in terms of the threat that we believe we will face in the UK. ""I think many years ago, the terrorist threat was pretty sophisticated. As people have seen, what we now face is pretty much low sophistication, person-borne attacks using vehicle or bladed weapons but the impact is significant. That's the broad scenario that we are testing."" Home Secretary Amber Rudd played a role in the exercise, taking time out from the Conservative Party conference to chair a COBR meeting involving ministers from the UK and Scottish governments. She said: ""The events of this year have shown why it is vital that the emergency services, Government and agencies prepare and rehearse our response to potential terrorist attacks. ""The professionalism with which front line services dealt with the atrocities in London and Manchester is in part due to the planning and practice that goes into exercises like this."""

2017-10-04,"It is tempting to say that the collapse of Monarch Airlines, while likely to result in the biggest peacetime repatriation ever, is pretty straightforward in business terms.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/why-monarch-is-the-latest-airline-to-go-under-and-more-could-follow-11064471,"On the face of it, this is little more than an over-geared company finally succumbing to its debts, as happens in many other sectors all the time. Yet there are a number of other reasons why Monarch has turned up its toes. One was the airline's weak financial position. Another is the gradual decline, since the rise of the low-cost carriers, of charter flying. :: What to do if you've booked with Monarch Exacerbating the problem for Monarch has been the litany of factors outlined by Andrew Swaffield, its chief executive, including terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, a collapse in demand for flights to Turkey, as well as the fall in sterling following the Brexit vote, which has pushed up the cost of jet fuel - which is priced in US dollars - for British carriers. Overwhelmingly, though, this is a story of what happens when supply exceeds demand which, as all economists know, is that prices come down. There has simply been too much capacity in the short-haul aviation market in Europe - which is why Monarch is the third major European airline to go under this year. Alitalia filed for bankruptcy in May and is currently in the process of being auctioned off. It was followed by Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest carrier, whose long-haul services will come to an end later this month after it became insolvent in August. And now Monarch. :: Monarch Airlines collapse affects 860,000 customers This over-capacity is a major structural issue and different carriers have responded in different ways. In the case of Ryanair, for example, it has been by trying to keep fares at ultra-low levels by running very tight schedules with little slack which, in recent weeks, has resulted in unintended flight cancellations. Ultimately, there are likely to be more airline failures, or at the very least more consolidation in the industry. How might this pan out? Dame Carolyn McCall, the outgoing chief executive of EasyJet, has just sketched out a scenario. In a presentation to shareholders last week, she said the European airline market resembled that of North America a decade ago. She noted that, 10 years ago, there were eight major airlines operating in the US and that the top four only accounted for between 40-45% of capacity. Today, the top four - American, United, Delta and SouthWest - account for 70% of the market. In Europe, at present, the top four carriers - Ryanair, EasyJet, Lufthansa and IAG, the parent of British Airways and Aer Lingus - only account for 49% of the market. Dame Carolyn added: ""This is going to change. European governments are finally coming to grips [with the fact] that they can't protect their markets from more efficient airlines, such as low-cost carriers. ""Wave one has already begun, with airlines such as Air Berlin and Alitalia that are in the midst of public sales. And this is just the beginning. ""It's going to take some time to play out, but I believe we will start to see mergers and consolidation between non-dying airlines to create real leadership positions and superior customer offerings."" :: Bride 'in tears' as Monarch collapse disrupts island wedding In this shake-out, the low-cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet have an advantage over what are known as the 'legacy' carriers like British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France, all of which are heavily unionised, have costly pension obligations and which mainly operate to and from expensive and congested airports like Heathrow, Frankfurt and Paris Charles de Gaulle. They also find themselves having to compete at one end with low-cost carriers in the European short-haul market and, on the other, in the long-haul market with the lavishly funded Gulf carriers and American carriers that, having seen their market consolidate already, enjoy improving finances. Now comes an additional threat, in the form of low-cost long-haul carriers, such as Norwegian. Only the best-managed and most adaptable will survive. IAG, whatever people may think of customer standards at British Airways, certainly looks to be up for the fight and recently began offering low-cost services on some routes out of Gatwick in head-to-head competition with Norwegian. But it is possible not all the old legacy carriers will survive. In the cut-throat European short-haul market, meanwhile, casualties are inevitable."
2017-10-04,"The Government's £2bn boost for building affordable homes has been welcomed by local councils, landlords and housing groups.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-promises-2bn-boost-for-affordable-homes-11066978,"In her speech at the Conservative Party conference, the Prime Minister announced the extra cash for the Tories' affordable housing programme, meaning £9.1bn will now be spent on building new homes before 2021. Theresa May highlighted how just 38% of those aged 25-34 own their own home, compared to 59% just over a decade ago. In a vow to ""make the British dream a reality by reigniting home ownership"", the Prime Minister said the Government would encourage councils and housing associations to bid for the new money. Mrs May said she would oversee ""a new generation of council houses to help fix our broken housing market"" and put developers on notice to ""do your duty"" and begin boosting the UK's housing stock. :: Coughing, P45 prank and set woes mar PM speech The Conservatives suggested the £2bn extra spend could see around 25,000 more social housing properties built, compared to under 7,000 delivered in 2015-16. It comes on top of the Chancellor's announcement of an extra £10bn investment in the ""Help to Buy"" scheme, announced earlier this week, planned to help a further 130,000 families. Responding to the Prime Minister's commitment, Local Government Association chairman Lord Porter expressed hopes of a ""genuine renaissance in council housebuilding"" and ""an important shift in the Government's housing vision"". Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Landlords Association, said: ""The majority of landlords would agree that more social housing should be built, and it's about time that the Prime Minister set aside a significant pot of money to do so."" The Chartered Institute for Housing hailed a ""recognition"" of the need for more social housing as ""a vital step forward"". But Labour insisted the Prime Minister's speech offered ""warm words but nowhere near enough action"" on housing. The Government was also attacked by free-market campaigners, with Sam Bowman, executive director of the Adam Smith Institute think tank, instead calling for an overhaul of planning laws. ""Social housing isn't what people want to live in. Almost everyone would like to own their own home,"" he said. ""We can do that, but only if we're prepared to change the rules of the game so that new developments benefit existing residents, and so that constraints on densification are eliminated."""

The cryo-electron microscopy method, developed with Joachim Frank, 77, of New York's Columbia University, and Jacques Dubochet, 75, of Switzerland's University of Lausanne, has implications for medicine shifting focus from organs to processes in cells. The Nobel committee hailed the group's technology, saying it had ""taken biochemistry into a new era"". The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences said the scientists' discovery allowed researchers to ""freeze biomolecules"" mid-movement and analyse processes that had not been seen before. The body said the development was ""decisive for both the basic understanding of life's chemistry and for the development of pharmaceuticals"". The 9m Swedish kronor (£830,000) prize, which will be shared amongst the three, rewards the researchers for their major advances in studying the extremely small bits of material that make up the building blocks of life. Following the win on Wednesday, Mr Frank told reporters the method meant medicine no longer focused on organs but ""looks at the processes in the cell"". The latest Nobel Prize win comes after the medicine prize went to three Americans studying circadian rhythms - Jeffrey C Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W Young. The physics prize went to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for detecting gravitational waves. The literature prize winner is set to be announced on Thursday and the peace prize is due to be announced on Friday."
2017-10-04,Three policemen have been cleared of lying to an inquest following the death of a patient at a mental health unit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171004234744/http://news.sky.com/story/policemen-cleared-of-lying-to-inquest-about-kingsley-burrells-death-11066921,"Paul Adey, Mark Fannon and Paul Greenfield were acquitted by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday after they were charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice. It was alleged that they had repeatedly lied about a cloth being placed over the head of Kingsley Burrell, 29, who died following a heart attack in March 2011. The officers had detained Mr Burrell after they were called to a disturbance. The court was told numerous witnesses had seen head or face covered with either a towel, sheet or blanket when he was put into a seclusion room at the Oleaster mental health unit in Birmingham. The West Midlands Police constables were accused of lying during an initial inquiry into Mr Burrell's death, and at a coroner's hearing that followed. Jurors deliberated for almost 10 hours before clearing the officers, who had denied all of the charges against them during the three-week trial. West Midlands Police Deputy Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe said: ""Our officers had a number of interactions with Mr Burrell in the four days prior to his death so we voluntarily referred the case to the IPCC - we have fully co-operated with all requests made by their investigators. ""The role these three officers played in the detention of Mr Burrell has now been thoroughly examined by independent investigators - and there has never been any suggestion they were criminally responsible for Mr Burrell's death. ""We do not underestimate the impact this investigation has had on Kingsley's family, the wider community and the officers; we share concerns that this investigation has taken such a length of time."" Ms Rolfe said lessons had been learned following the case on how to deal with people with mental health needs. She added: ""In 2013 we launched a mental health triage scheme which sees officers teamed with paramedics and psychiatric nurses on a specialist vehicle to respond to calls involving people thought to be experiencing mental ill health. ""The team provides on-the-spot assessments, often in the street or in private property, which has led to a dramatic drop in the number of people deemed necessary to detain under the Mental Health Act."" Mr Burrell's family has since spoken out against the decision and his sister Kadisha Brown-Burrell has vowed to continue fighting for justice. Family spokesman Desmond Jaddoo has called for a fresh review of all the evidence surrounding Mr Burrell's death - as well as a full public inquiry into the circumstances of the father-of-three's treatment. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which concluded the officers had cases to answer for gross misconduct following two investigations, has said it will be in contact with West Midlands Police ""regarding the outstanding issue of disciplinary proceedings""."
2017-10-06,Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has reportedly written to every pilot who works for the airline offering them better pay to stay.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171007005132/http://news.sky.com/story/ryanair-boss-michael-oleary-promises-pilots-better-pay-to-stay-11068934,"The letter comes after a pilot rota crisis forced the airline to cancel thousands of flights. In the letter Mr O'Leary is said to have asked pilots not to abandon the company and offered them incentives to stay. He reportedly promised pay rises, a ""productivity/loyalty bonus"" and ""significant improvements"" to contracts and career progression. The promises follow a tumultuous month for the carrier in which it was forced to cancel tens of thousands of flights twice. The cancellations have disrupted the travel plans of more than 700,000 passengers. In the letter, reported on and seen by TheJournal.ie, the Ryanair chief executive urges pilots not to ditch the company for ""less financially secure/or Brexit challenged airlines"". The letter reportedly includes a section entitled ""Learning from this mistake"". In it Mr O'Leary pledges that there will be ""significant changes to, and investment in, our rostering and pilot career development"" over the next six months. He also offers pilots a bonus of €12,000 (£10,700) and promises he will exceed the pay deals offered by rival airlines. Near the end of the letter he writes: ""If you have or are considering joining one of these less financially secure/or Brexit challenged airlines, I urge you to stay with Ryanair for a brighter better future for you and your family."" Ryanair says 98% of customers hit by flight cancellations in September and October have been refunded or offered alternative transport. The company also says the reduced winter schedule will ""eliminate all risk of further flight cancellations""."
2017-10-06,"""Productivity isn't everything,"" wrote the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, ""But in the long run it is almost everything.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171007005132/http://news.sky.com/story/productivity-decline-is-headache-for-hammond-11069356,"What he meant by that, he went on to say, is that a country's ability to improve its living standards over time depend almost entirely on its ability to raise output per worker. On that basis, latest productivity figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will not have been welcomed with much rejoicing in the Treasury. According to the ONS, productivity - as measured by output per worker per hour - during the second quarter of the year was 0.1% lower than in the first three months of the year. It wasn't all bad news: productivity in the services sector, which accounts for three-quarters of UK GDP, actually rose by 0.2%. But the overall figures were dragged down by a 1.3% drop in productivity in the manufacturing sector. This potentially creates a problem for Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, because next Tuesday the Office for Budget Responsibility - the body that provides independent oversight of the UK public finances - is due to publish analysis in which, according to a report in the Financial Times, it will admit that it has persistently over-estimated UK productivity. The expectation is that it will therefore downgrade its productivity forecasts for the year - and, with it, by extension, their growth forecasts. That will in turn impact the public finances and the Chancellor's ability to minimise any adverse impact of Brexit on the economy. The OBR was forecasting as recently as March that productivity would increase by 1.5% during the second quarter. For 2017 as a whole, the OBR has been forecasting productivity growth of 1.6%, followed by 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020. If those forecasts are revised lower, it is inevitable that lower forecasts for GDP growth will follow. As the OBR noted in July: ""If trend productivity and GDP growth were just 0.3 percentage points a year lower than we assume, half the £26bn of headroom the Government has against its structural deficit target for 2020-21 would be lost."" Why did productivity growth go backwards? Quite simply because the increase in the number of hours worked during the period was greater than the increase in economic output in that period. The figures confirm Britain's dismal productivity record in recent years. Output per worker per hour remains roughly the same as it was before the crisis. It is worth pointing out that this is not just a British problem. Since the global financial crisis, there has been slower growth in most major economies, including slower productivity growth. But the figures published by the ONS also offer an international comparison and this is by no means favourable to Britain. The ONS notes that the gap between productivity in Britain and the rest of the G7 advanced economies - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - narrowed last year. That's the good news. The bad news is that output per hour worked in the UK was 15.1% below the average for the rest of the G7 in 2016. The most popular way of expressing this productivity shortfall is to say that, roughly speaking, a French, German or American worker can produce as much in four days as a British worker does in five. Economists and politicians have spent many hours debating why UK productivity remains so poor compared with that of our major international competitors. One theory is that it is because, compared with a country like France, we prefer to have lower rates of unemployment. In France, where the jobless rate is more than double that of the UK's, the least productive workers are on the dole. In Britain, they go to work. But that doesn't explain the productivity shortfall with countries like the US and Germany that have comparable levels of unemployment with Britain. Another theory is that business investment in Britain lags that of competitor economies. In Britain, most GDP growth since the crisis has been due to more people entering the labour force - partly reflecting the UK's attractiveness to migrant workers - rather than more capital being invested. Another explanation could be that Britain is a smaller and more crowded country than our competitors. All the other G7 economies have lower population densities than Britain, with the exception of Japan, which has a similar productivity issue. Every traffic jam, every delay on the railways, every constraint on production caused by cramped office space, every delay to take-off and landing at the UK's airports all contributes to weaker productivity. And here's another possible explanation - while Britons are at work, some of them may not actually be doing very much. Early closing of shops in France does not necessarily mean lower retail sales overall - it simply means the same amount of shopping is packed into fewer hours. That would manifest itself in a French shop worker being more productive than their British equivalent. It all goes to show just what a nebulous subject productivity is - and why politicians of all parties have found it so hard, over the years, to inspire an improvement in it."

The ECB says they have not made a final decision on whether he will play for England during this winter's Ashes series. But if he does play, he will travel to Australia at a later date. An update on the police investigation into Stokes is not expected until the middle of October at the earliest. England team director Andrew Strauss said: ""With the Ashes just around the corner, it's important to give the players, the coaching staff and supporters some clarity around a complex situation. ""This decision will help us in the weeks ahead and give every player and the whole England set-up the best chance to focus on the challenge ahead in Australia."" The ECB also announced that Steven Finn will now be added to the Ashes squad as a result of the changes. Prior to his arrest England all-rounder Stokes had been named as vice-captain for the Ashes tour. Neither Stokes, nor his teammate Alex Hales, who was with him when the incident occurred, are being selected for international matches until further notice. Hales has spoken to police about the incident, which took place outside a Bristol nightclub on 25 September. ""We have spoken to Ben and assured him that our decision in no way prejudges the outcome of the ongoing police investigation or cricket discipline commission process, as can be seen by the award of central contracts,"" said Strauss. Both players had their central contracts renewed by the ECB this week, despite the ongoing investigation. In an unrelated issue three other England cricket players have been fined by the ECB. Written warnings were issued to Jonny Bairstow, Jake Ball and Liam Plunkett following a disciplinary investigation into behaviour during the recent one-day series against West Indies. The ECB says that the issue is ""unrelated to the investigations into Ben Stokes and Alex Hales""."

In a statement issued through his MP Tim Loughton, he said: ""I am delighted and relieved to be back at home with my family after the ordeal of the last six weeks. ""They have been unwavering in their support and worked hard to secure my release. ""I am also very grateful to friends and members of the local community who have been very supportive in so many ways, which has undoubtedly made a difficult time more bearable.

A Turkish court ruled Mr Robyns would be released and face no further proceedings on 29 September. He had been detained at two prisons in the Bodrum area and could have faced 10 years in jail if he had been tried and found guilty."

He sought damages for the upkeep of the ""unwanted"" child born the following summer, but he lost his case on Friday. However, Mr Justice Jay said: ""Although he [ARB] has lost this case, my judgment must be seen as a complete personal and moral vindication for ARB. ""The same, of course, cannot be said for R."" ARB split from R, with who he already had a son by IVF, in May 2010. In October 2010, R handed the clinic a consent to thaw form, signed by her and purportedly signed by ARB. As a result, an embryo was thawed and successfully implanted. ARB alleged that R had forged his signature as the relationship had broken down - a claim denied by the woman. The judge concluded ARB did not sign the consent to thaw form in October or at all and that his signature was forged by R, but ruled out the clinic bearing any financial responsibility. He said the woman had ""resorted to desperate, dishonest measures"". Mr Justice Jay also declared that the clinic was ""not negligent"". He said: ""I have held that the clinic owed a strict contractual obligation to ARB to obtain his written consent to the procedure, and that the clinic is in breach of that obligation because it did not obtain it. ""I have also held that the clinic was not negligent. The claim fails owing to public policy. I have held that the principles underpinning two House of Lords' decisions in NHS claims given some 15 years ago apply equally to this contractual claim."" IVF Hammersmith's Jude Fleming said he was ""pleased"" with the result. In a statement, ARB said: ""We welcome this judgment, which has found in our favour in respect of all issues relating to our primary case. ""This claim has never been about money; it is about justice."" He indicated he would appeal over ""the isolated point of principle"" up to the Supreme Court if necessary."

Prosecutors said he sent pictures of himself via Snapchat and requested topless photos through Facebook. Shade, from Sheringham in Norfolk, was working at a youth project in the county when the offences took place between 2012 and 2015. The vulnerable girls were between 14 and 17, and he was between 19 and 21 at the time. Shade initially sought help from the youth project as a young person, but became formally employed as a youth worker after turning 18.

Sources said the visit had been pencilled in for several days during the week of 6 November, with Parliament scheduled to be in recess from 7 to 13 November. They added, however, that it was postponed earlier this week because Downing Street officials were informed by China's government that it would not be able to accommodate her in such close proximity to an Asian tour by President Trump. The US President is due to visit five countries in the Far East, including China and Japan, between 3 and 14 November. Another complicating factor in organising Mrs May's trade mission has been the Chinese Communist Party's congress, which takes place every five years and will be held later this month. While her trade mission has been postponed rather than cancelled, it is understood to have frustrated officials in Whitehall who are keen for the Government to get on with delivering its vision of ""a global Britain"". A recent trip to Japan by the PM and other ministers yielded little of value in terms of bilateral corporate deals The Prime Minister's wafer-thin Commons majority, which is reliant on the support of the DUP, has forced officials to organise visits such as the prospective one to China during periods when Parliament is in recess. Insiders pointed out that most major overseas visits by prime ministers took place during recess. Whitehall sources said they were now seeking to fix another date - possibly shortly before Christmas - to carry out the long-delayed China trade mission. That will leave open the possibility that the trip will never happen at all, given the growing momentum against Mrs May from within the Conservative Party's parliamentary ranks. Dozens of MPs are said to be supportive of the idea of a change of leader, with talks led by the former party chairman Grant Shapps growing in intensity following the PM's disastrous conference speech this week. Mrs May was originally due to go to China In July, but that was postponed despite her having declared in January that she would visit the world's most populous country ""relatively soon"". An insider pointed out that a trip in November had never been either finalised with Beijing or publicly announced. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""This is nonsense. No 10 has neither organised nor publicised any such trip."" Government sources also dismissed rumours that the PM's invitation had been withdrawn by Beijing altogether as ""nonsense"". Private sector bosses say they are concerned that Mrs May's political weakness at home may hamper her ability to act as a figurehead for bilateral trade deals which need to be struck once Britain leaves the EU in 2019. Even before then, however, talks about trade have taken on additional importance amid uncertainty about the lingering possibility of a ""cliff-edge"" Brexit which could leave the UK having to revert to World Trade Organisation rules. Mrs May will meet bosses from companies including HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Whitbread and WPP on Monday for talks on Brexit and trade issues. :: Analysis: Will May survive or choose to press eject herself? Last year, Mrs May called for a new ""golden era"" of UK-China relations following a rocky start after she became PM, when she reviewed China's planned investment in the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station. Having cleared that project, Chinese-backed companies have continued to invest in corporate Britain, with the latest deal a prospective takeover of the chipmaker Imagination Technologies. That deal has, though, sparked opposition from MPs including Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and former Business Secretary."

2017-10-06,Grant Shapps has hit the headlines and sparked a Conservative Party feud by leading a plot to oust Theresa May.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171007005132/http://news.sky.com/story/grant-shapps-who-is-tory-mp-leading-plot-against-theresa-may-11069236,"The Prime Minister says she still has the ""full support"" of the Cabinet, but the move rekindled questions over her future at the helm of the party. But who is Mr Shapps? The 49-year-old former Conservative Party chairman and David Cameron loyalist has had a long and chequered career. :: Early Life Mr Shapps was born in Croxley Green, Hertfordshire and went to a grammar school in nearby Watford. He was president of the Jewish youth group BBYO and studied business and finance at Manchester Metropolitan University. Half-way through his degree while in the US, as a 20-year-old, he nearly died in a car crash. He was in a coma for almost a week before he eventually recovered. Ten years later was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, undergoing both chemo and radiotherapy. He was successfully treated. He has two musical relations - a brother, Andre Shapps, who played keyboard for the band Big Audio Dynamite and a cousin, Mick Jones, who was a founding member of The Clash. :: Political career Mr Shapps became MP for Welwyn Hatfield in 2005 - after two failed attempts to enter Parliament - and was a rising star under David Cameron's coalition government. He was appointed housing minister in 2010 and two years later stepped up to the top position of party chairman, sitting in on cabinet. But the married father-of-three was engulfed in two embarrassing mishaps, the first over alleged use of some pseudonyms - Michael Green and Sebastian Fox - and the second about holding another job. Mr Shapps denied ever having used the pen names before entering Parliament, and threatened to sue a constituent who claimed on Facebook that he had. He also ruled out ever having split his time as an MP with another job, saying in February 2015: ""Let me get this absolutely clear...I don't have a second job and have never had a second job while being an MP. End of story."" A month later he U-turned and admitted he had ""over-firmly"" denied both claims. Despite the hiccups, Mr Cameron stood by the man he later described as ""a loyal and trusted supporter of mine from the very beginning"". :: Bullying scandal Things got much worse when a bullying scandal was revealed within the party's youth wing that Mr Shapps oversaw. He and other senior figures were criticised for allegedly ignoring intimidation and harassment claims against Mark Clarke, an activist hired to run the ""Road Trip 2015"" battle bus campaign during the 2015 General Election campaign. A young supporter, Elliott Johnson, killed himself in September that year, sparking several investigations. Mr Johnson's parents called on Mr Shapps to resign for ""telling lies"" and failing to take the bullying claims seriously. A day later, he did, saying: ""Whatever the rights and wrongs of a serious case like this, responsibility should rest somewhere. ""Over the past few weeks, as individual allegations have come to light, I have come to the conclusion that the buck should stop with me."" That experience is still fresh in the mind of some MPs, who have publicly criticised his latest leadership bid.

It shows her leaning against a hotel balcony, wearing high-waisted bikini bottoms and a crop top. After seeing the image, some fans thought there was something wrong, asking ""why is the wall curved?"" and ""is it available without Photoshop?"" Another one posted: ""Photoshop fail."" But Kylie hit back, posting another image of herself in the same location to her 1.5 million followers on Instagram and 2.36 million on Twitter. Again, the wall in the background appears to be curved. ""Lovers you have eagle eyes,"" she said. ""I'll ask the Chateau Marmont (hotel) to straighten their walls but it's part of the charm!! Wonkywalls. ""However, thanks for being on it!"" Other fans were also quick to defend the star. One post on Instagram said: ""Anyone who has seen kylie in the flesh knows she don't need anything more than her charm, sparkling beauty and that infectious smile."" Another said: ""The shadow is being cast by the cover over the balcony which is why the shadow line isnt straight.""

Chief executive Carolyn McCall said conditions remained ""challenging"" and it expected more pressure on yields - a key measure of airlines' financial performance - as it battles rivals. The airline's fourth quarter trading update also revealed a £100m hit to profits for the year from the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote - an issue that the group had previously flagged.

The group said: ""Passengers have benefitted from low summer fares across the network, particularly on beach markets from the UK."" This came at a cost to the airline, with revenue per seat down 3.7% - after stripping out currency changes - in the fourth quarter, though this was slightly better than had been expected.

Hype followed by haplessness. Except it's happened so often now that even the hype isn't what it used to be. Watching the late, laboured, fortunate victory over Slovenia (world ranking 55) that confirmed England's passage to Russia next summer, one yearned for counter-arguments to the prevalent world-weary cynicism about our national team in our national sport. Few were forthcoming. So who can blame the football fan if he/she is more excited about the Premier League meeting of Liverpool and Manchester United on Saturday week, or Tottenham's trip to Real Madrid in the Champions League three days later. :: England qualify for 2018 World Cup in Russia Are there reasons for optimism despite all this? Some. Manager Gareth Southgate at least acknowledges there is a problem, and is in tune with his boss. Reflecting on England's ignominious exit at the hands of Iceland in last year's European Championships, FA chief executive Martin Glenn said: ""England players do not travel well. We know there is a brittleness in unfamiliar circumstances we have to deal with."" Brushing aside the argument that professional footballers ought not to faint at the prospect of playing significant matches in not-very-distant France, one could instead focus on England's bright emerging talents, coveted not just in this country but abroad too. There were occasional signs last night too that Tottenham's Harry Kane - who scored the very late match-winner at Wembley - might grow into a proper captain and leader. But a reminder that he is no Bobby Moore came this week when one of the surviving members of Moore's 1966 World Cup winners visited Southgate's men in training. Sir Bobby Charlton told them: ""I know that the manager has the ability and I do hope that you can give me one of the greatest memories of my life [by winning the trophy again]"". Current international Marcus Rashford described Sir Bobby's visit as ""the biggest inspiration we can have as players"". At Wembley last night, perspiration was much more in evidence. Southgate is under no illusions. ""This team has potential,"" the manager said, ""but we have a hell of a lot of work to do."" At least England will be in Russia next summer. Countries not yet certain to join them include the Netherlands, Portugal and Italy. And we can be reasonably confident that England fans will not cause the mayhem that an ugly minority wreaked in France last year. Russia's security forces will see to that."

Mrs May says she has the ""full support"" of her Cabinet. Sterling was also lower against the euro. The pound had climbed above $1.36 in September amid speculation about an interest rise later this year and improved sentiment about the outcome of Brexit talks. But there has since been a reversal in the mood after monthly PMI data showed little signs of improvement in growth prospects and with the Prime Minister's position looking increasingly shaky. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said another Tory leadership battle would be ""seriously bruising for the pound"". The pound's fall has helped the FTSE 100 to climb to a two-month high, above the 7,500 mark. That is because the dip boosts the sterling value of the foreign currency earnings by the index's multinational companies."

2017-10-06,Royal Mail has vowed to stop the first national postal strike since 2013 after the union representing front line staff announced when it will stage a 48-hour walkout.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171007005132/http://news.sky.com/story/union-delivers-royal-mail-strike-dates-in-pension-and-pay-row-11068139,"The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which has refused to rule out strikes in the run-up to the crucial Christmas delivery period, said 110,000 workers will begin industrial action at 11am on Thursday 19 October. Earlier this week, the union said staff had voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favour of a walkout - with representatives calling for Royal Mail bosses to resign because they had lost the trust of their workforce. The CWU accuses management of presiding over a campaign of cost cutting and asset stripping since its controversial privatisation four years ago - hitting pay and pension deals in the process. Royal Mail responded to the strike date announcement by immediately threatening to block it in the courts should its offer of further talks be rejected. It claims a legal agreement it has in place with the union prevents it from taking strike action at the current stage of a grievance process. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: ""This is a watershed dispute that will determine not only our members' pensions, jobs and pay but also the future of the service. ""Postal workers delivered a massive Yes vote for strike action and we are determined to take whatever steps are necessary to deliver an agreement that will protect and enhance our members' terms and conditions and improve the range of services on offer to customers. ""As well as this call to action, the CWU will now launch a major campaign to gain public and political support for postal workers. ""This is your service. We must work together to save it."" The union said its members at Parcelforce will also be involved in the action, threatening wider disruption to deliveries. Post Office mail operations, while not directly involved in the dispute, are likely to suffer knock-on effects. Royal Mail indicated its efforts to block any strike would be on the grounds it would break an 'Agenda for Growth' labour agreement made with the CWU in 2013. The company said: ""Royal Mail will be writing to the CWU invoking the external mediation process under the dispute resolution procedures in the Agenda for Growth. ""These legally-binding dispute resolution procedures were set up as a vehicle to resolve industrial disputes. ""We wish to use them to do just that. Royal Mail will use all legal options at its disposal, including applying to the High Court for an injunction to prevent industrial action."""

Bombardier is already facing a 220% tariff on a new model of passenger jet as part of a separate investigation into claims from US firm Boeing that it received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. The wings for the jet are made in Northern Ireland and Bombardier has said the C-Series model affected by the row is ""critical"" to its operations there. Bombardier is due to begin delivering a blockbuster order for up to 125 new planes to Atlanta-based Delta Airlines next year. Prime Minister Theresa May has lobbied President Donald Trump over the row, with Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon warning Boeing its actions could jeopardise future UK Government contracts. Announcing the latest tariff, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said: ""The United States is committed to free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada, but this is not our idea of a properly functioning trading relationship. ""We will continue to verify the accuracy of this decision, while doing everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers."" Washington said its move was out of concern to prevent ""injurious dumping"" - exporting a product to a country at a lower price - of imports into the US, ""establishing an opportunity to compete on a level playing field"". Bombardier did not provide the information requested, according to the Commerce Department. It added: ""The anti-dumping duty law provides US businesses and workers with a transparent, quasi-judicial, and internationally accepted mechanism to seek relief from the market-distorting effects caused by injurious dumping of imports into the United States."" Boeing alleges the unfair subsidy stems from when Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration and the UK Government pledged to invest nearly £135m to help set up a C-Series manufacturing site in Belfast. The firm also took umbrage with Bombardier receiving $1bn (£765m) from the Canadian provincial government in Quebec in 2015, when its fortunes appeared to be flagging. Boeing claims its complaint is a bid to seek a ""level playing field"" for global competitors, but Bombardier has accused its rival of hypocrisy. Trade unions expect a final ruling on the pricing policy in February."

Michael Hutchence: The Last Rockstar, which airs in a two-part special on the Seven Network in Australia later this month, provides a glimpse into the artist's private world. It charts his career, his relationships with women and his bandmates through interviews, never-before-seen photographs and footage. During his life, Hutchence had a string of relationships with prominent actresses, models and singers, including Helena Christensen. The documentary also includes an interview with a woman he dated for three years whom he broke up with for Kylie Minogue. The star then got together with British TV presenter Paula Yates, who died of a heroin overdose in 2000, after the pair met on the set of her show The Big Breakfast. The couple had a daughter together, Tiger Lily, and previously unreleased images in a trailer for the programme show Hutchence's paternal side. One photo shows him cradling his baby daughter while asleep on a bed, while in another he can be seen gently kissing her on her head. She was just a year old when Hutchence died. The impact of the rockstar's loss of his sense of taste and smell after he was attacked by a taxi driver in Copenhagen in 1992 is also discussed. ""He changed and became far more aggressive,"" bandmate Andrew Farriss says in the documentary.

Jurors at Snaresbrook Crown Court heard how she kissed the teenager in a classroom and had sex with him at an Ibis hotel. She also took the boy to her parents' home in Wanstead Park, east London. McBrearty pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to seven counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust. During Friday's sentencing, she put her head in her hands and sobbed in the dock as Judge Sheelagh Canavan jailed her. The judge said the woman was ""bright, intelligent and gifted"" and ""knew right from wrong"", but that she had committed the ""grossest breach of trust"". She said: ""You engaged in a full-blown sexual relationship with a 15-year-old child. ""I accept he was consenting - what 15-year-old schoolboy would turn down such an attractive offer? ""I accept you truly believed this was a great romance, you were in love with him and vice versa, and that age didn't matter. But it did. ""You were supposed to keep him safe, to help him make the right decisions. ""Instead, you helped him make all the wrong ones."" The relationship began after McBrearty sent the pupil a friend request on social media. Prosecutor Lisa Matthews said the boy ""felt special"" and was ""besotted"" with the teacher, who would take him to parks and for meals. The relationship ended when his father called the police. Emma Shafton, defending, said: ""This is a young lady who has had a spectacular fall from grace - university educated, comes from a respectable family - she has been utterly disgraced by this."" She said McBrearty was ""not sexually attracted to children"", but added: ""She will of course be branded a paedophile for the rest of her life. She is a sex offender.""

The 37-year-old also faces a third charge of damaging a gas valve at their home a few days earlier, stemming from the second allegation that he attempted to kill his 40-year-old wife. He denies all of the charges. Mark Bayada, chief instructor of the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon since 2013, told Winchester Crown Court that Mrs Cilliers, who has completed more than 2,600 jumps, was a qualified instructor ""in the top per cent of competency in the country"". Talking about her teaching ability, he added: ""Absolutely brilliant, never had any issues at all with what she taught, top notch, no negatives about her teaching."" Mr Bayada, who joined the Parachute Regiment in 1987 and went on to join the Red Devils, explained to the court what is required to prepare the kit for jumps. He said that the slinks, which join the harness and the rigging lines, were ""vital"". Two of them were found to be missing from Mrs Cilliers' reserve parachute. The jury was shown a video of Mr Bayada explaining the different types of parachute malfunctions and demonstrating how a parachute is packed and worn. In the clip he shows how the slinks are attached, and said: ""The more it pulls, the more it tightens itself, making it almost impossible for it to come off by mistake."" Describing the malfunction of Mrs Cilliers' main parachute, he said: ""We are looking at a distorted canopy where lines had crossed, it was distorted, rotated and bunched up."" The court has already heard that when Mrs Cilliers was unable to jump on the Easter Saturday due to bad weather, the defendant arranged to keep her hire parachute in her locker overnight. Mr Bayada said he could not think why someone would do this, adding: ""Everyone is expected to return it to the kit store. There is no financial benefit to keeping it out."" Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, has suggested Cilliers did not want to do this because he had already tampered with it. Mr Bayada said he was there when Mrs Cilliers suffered her ""near-fatal fall"" when both her main and reserve parachutes failed. He said the reason she survived could have been because of her small size and the surface of the field, which had been ploughed and was ""exceptionally soft"". Mr Bayada told the court he noticed that the lines from the main parachute were tangled and that two of the four slinks were missing from the reserve. The prosecution alleges that Cilliers tampered with the parachute and sabotaged the reserve by removing two of the slinks. Mr Bayada said it was his view that the main parachute had been sabotaged by wrapping the lines around each other within the parachute container. He said the only innocent explanation for the missing slinks was that they had been cut off by one of the first aiders or medics, but he later found that no one had cut anything apart from her goggles strap. The trial has been adjourned until Friday."

""They are preparing for new tests of a long-range missile,"" RIA quoted Mr Morozov, a member of the Russian Duma's international affairs committee, as saying. ""They even gave us mathematical calculations that they believe prove that their missile can hit the west coast of the United States. ""As far as we understand, they intend to launch one more long-range missile in the near future. And in general, their mood is rather belligerent."" US President Donald Trump has said he is fully prepared to take the ""military option"" to deal with Pyongyang, which has carried out repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in the face of UN sanctions. Earlier this year it was claimed North Korea had successfully developed a miniaturised nuclear warhead that can fit inside one of its intercontinental ballistic missiles, which would be a key step in its nuclear ambitions. Mr Trump has been involved in an escalating war of words with Kim Jong Un since entering the White House in January, stoking fears the charged rhetoric could turn into a military conflict. The President recently said negotiating with Pyongyang was a ""waste of time"", and used his first address to the UN General Assembly in New York to pledge to ""totally destroy"" the reclusive state if it threatens the US."
2017-10-06,An overwhelming number of Tory MPs do not want Theresa May to resign imminently over concerns about her leadership.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171007005132/http://news.sky.com/story/only-three-mps-call-for-theresa-may-to-resign-imminently-sky-poll-finds-11069763,"Only three MPs have admitted to Sky News that they want the Prime Minister to go, after former party chairman Grant Shapps said 30 wanted her to stand down. Sky News contacted 285 MPs, and of the 103 who either replied or spoke publicly, just three called for Mrs May to go. One hundred said there should be no immediate change to the leadership. Sky sources say that David Cameron has been in touch with his successor in Downing Street and remains fully behind Mrs May. But despite this some MPs still expressed serious reservations about Mrs May's abilities, and hinted she was one crisis away from being forced out. :: May insists she has 'full support' of Cabinet One current MP and former minister denied to Sky News that they were behind any ""plot"" but that the PM would find it ""very, very difficult to survive"". They said the ""image of her leaving Downing Street with tears in her eyes"" would have a profound effect on the party. But they added there were ""probably many more"" than the 30 disaffected MPs allegedly held on a list by Mr Shapps, warning: ""I think the party is in a dreadful hole"". ""I think the damage that would be done to the party if she was forced out would be immense, and like many others I hope she herself will conclude that the best thing would be to go."" :: Grant Shapps: Who is Tory MP leading plot against May? ""What Grant is saying is widely agreed with."" Another current MP and former minister who said Mrs May should step down told Sky News ""the writing is on the wall - I can't see her going on"". Most MPs Sky News contacted said Mrs May should stay on for the good of party and country, praising her ""grit"" after a problem-plagued conference speech. Some simply offered their ""full support"" and said they were ""100%"" backing the PM. :: Analysis: Will PM survive or choose to press eject herself? But others went further, taking swipes at their colleagues. One MP told Sky News the leadership challenge rumours were ""a way of settling old scores, led by someone with little experience of working as a team player"". Another accused ""Remainers"" of trying to ""derail Brexit"" by destabalising Mrs May so they could ""better control"" a push for policies like remaining in the Customs Union. An informed source also claimed MP Nadine Dorries was leading a ""witch-hunt"" against some colleagues in the closely-guarded Tory MPs WhatsApp group. :: Public think Theresa May is a weak leader - Sky Data poll ""They check the message has been read and then if there is no answer, Nadine presumes they are on the list,"" the source told Sky News. ""Hilariously they have added Shapps to the group today so he can see all the angry responses from backbenchers."" The source also claimed that Downing Street's gamble to flush Mr Shapps out by briefing the media first had led to more people on his list converting into actual letters sent to the influential 1922 Committee. They cautioned the move was not over - and that a challenge did not have to happen ""immediately"". Mrs May could struggle to discipline her party's former chairman, given the tight numbers game she faces in the Commons without a majority government. Mr Shapps is also understood to have the full support of his constituency association. But another MP did warn: ""The duty is on us to support the leadership with the necessary discipline."""
2017-10-06,Dozens of offshore oil and gas platforms and drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico have been evacuated as Tropical Storm Nate approaches the US.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171007005132/http://news.sky.com/story/us-oil-rigs-evacuated-as-tropical-storm-nate-approaches-gulf-coast-11070082,"The storm, which has already killed 22 people in Central America, has forced the evacuation of more than 60 platforms and drilling rigs as of late Friday morning local time. Five rigs operating in the Gulf have been evacuated, while 11 other rigs have been moved out of Nate's path. It comes as a hurricane warning was issued for a stretch of the US Gulf Coast, ranging from Louisiana to the Alabama-Florida border. The National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, said residents in those states should be ready for possible storm surges as Tropical Storm Nate is expected to strengthen. The storm had been heading towards Mexico's Yucatan peninsula but changed its path on Friday morning, meaning it is now only expected to skim tourist hotspots such as Cancun. The centre said Nate was blowing maximum sustained winds of 50mph and was about 125 miles southeast of the Mexican holiday island of Cozumel early on Friday afternoon. Forecasters have warned that the storm, after crossing open water, could hit the northern rim of the US Gulf Coast as a category one hurricane. Alabama, Florida and Mississippi have all declared states of emergency. There is expected to be six to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) of rain in parts of Honduras and Nicaragua, two to four inches (5 to 10 cm) of rain in eastern Yucatan and western Cuba and three to six inches (8 to 15 inches) of rain in the US central Gulf Coast as Nate makes its way north. As of Friday afternoon, Nate was moving northwest at 21mph, a fast pace that, if maintained, means the storm would reach land before it is at its strongest. The storm hit Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 11 people in Nicaragua, eight in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and one in El Salvador. Thousands of people were forced to evacuate their homes and a state of emergency was declared in Costa Rica, closing schools and all other non-essential services. President Luis Guillermo Solis declared three days of mourning and urged people to remain vigilant into the weekend, noting more rain was likely."

The Green Giants niblets corn cost eight pence, according to the package design. Charity workers believe people wanted to be generous by donating items but may not have realised they were out of date. Helen Bull, from Cardiff Foodbank where the tins were handed in, said: ""Probably what's happened is that it is harvest time and lots of people clean out their cupboards and donate items that they have never used and don't really look at them. ""Unfortunately what sometimes happens is that when an older person dies the family will clean out the cupboards and they want to donate and don't necessarily realise that it was out of date."" Cardiff Foodbank, which handed out 14,189 three-day emergency food supplies to people in crisis in 2016, tweeted about the find: ""It's a record!! Never had a donation to @CardiffFoodbank with 10d on before! @HeinzUK"" Heinz responded by saying: ""Wow! That soup was discontinued over 35 years ago. Should be in a museum rather than a food bank! :)"" Ms Bull, who said it costs between £80,000-£100,000 to run the foodbank each year, added the charity had to waste a lot of food which was out of date."
2017-10-06,A growing number of young people are worrying about the state of their finances and want to see the Government take action to curb credit card lending.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171007005132/http://news.sky.com/story/sky-data-finds-growing-number-of-18-34-year-olds-worried-about-their-finances-11062894,"Research carried out by Sky News shows that 65% of people aged between 18 and 34 are worried about how they'll cope if and when interest rates go up - a much higher level of anxiety than any other age group. At the same time, new analysis from the debt charity Stepchange shows that more and more young people are seeking emergency advice on how to manage their finances, and deal with problems managing their credit. Nearly two-thirds of the people coming to the charity for help are now under the age of 40 - just six years ago, that group made up only half of Stepchange's clients. This new data adds to the complex picture of Britain's debt profile. The level of unsecured debt, which includes personal loans, car finance, overdrafts and credit cards, has recently surpassed £200bn - returning to a level last seen at the tail end of the financial crisis. In itself, it's not an earth-shaking amount - mortgage debt is something like eight times bigger than unsecured borrowing - but the Bank of England is worried that lenders are not taking enough care in how they decide whether to make a loan. So while the Bank of England is still sanguine about the health of the UK economy - and has made clear signs that it plans to start increasing the interest rate soon - it is still worried about certain pockets. And chief among those is consumer credit. Why? Well mainly because this sort of unsecured credit carries a lot more risk for banks and lenders than offering a mortgage, which is secured against a house. In the event of a downturn, people are much more likely to default on personal loans - the Bank of England says that British retail banks could faces losses of £30bn in the event of another financial crisis. But also because the consumer has been so important to the health of the UK economy in recent years. Data from Visa, the payments processing company, suggests that consumer spending has dipped in recent months, while car sales have also shown a decline. A nation of shoppers appears to be becoming more wary. And perhaps with reason. The Bank of England may profess to be relaxed about the state of the economy, but not everyone is convinced. The University of Edinburgh's business school, hosting a biennial credit risk and credit scoring conference, canvassed professionals from the credit industry about the nation's financial prospects. In its analysis, more than two thirds (66%) predicted another credit crunch was likely to happen by 2022 and more than a third (38%) believed a financial crisis could hit even sooner - within the next three years. That might explain an appetite for greater restrictions on credit card companies. Sky Data asked our sample of adults if they would support Government restrictions on how much spending people should be allowed to accrue on a credit card, and found 64% in favour of statutory limits. The greatest support came from young people, with seven in 10 backing the idea. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, told Sky News she would be monitoring the level of household debt. She said: ""I think it's always going to be very unwise to continue to lend to people who cannot pay back their debts and have no way of doing so. ""That's deeply stressful for the people who have those debts, it's also very bad for the banks and lenders. ""In my experience it's impossible to say where the next crisis is going to come from, but undoubtedly people are looking at whether it's very high household debt, car loans, other forms of unsecured lending, and worrying that that could be sowing the seeds for future problems."" Ah, car loans. It's impossible now to have a conversation about the levels of debt without reference to the booming market in car finance. It's now worth around £53bn, and often cited as a sign of how reliant we are on credit. But those who run this sector maintain it is one of the safest parts of the credit business. ""There has been some inaccurate comments about this, but to be honest, this is a big market, and it's only right that it's open to scrutiny,"" said Adrian Dally, head of motor finance and the Finance and Leasing Association. ""It's obviously open to scrutiny by the regulators, that's their job, but equally it's only right that we're open to scrutiny by the public as well. ""But it's a question of getting this into perspective. Car finance amounts to just 1.2% of household income. So in that sense, although it's a significant area of consumer lending, you have to get it in proportion. Arrears rates are at historically low levels, and for motor finance, at a lower level than for other forms of credit."" It is a complex picture, in cars as much as the rest of the economy, and it may be about to become more complicated. Interest rates will rise before long, perhaps as soon as November, making it more gradually more expensive and onerous to borrow money. Credit is not a bad thing in itself - the problem come when you can't pay back the money. And when interest rates go up, that problem will become more onerous.

In an interview with Sky News, Mr Castro urged Catalan leaders to drop plans for an independence declaration, suggesting they would be treated as ""outlaws"" if it went ahead. His comments came as pro-independence lawmakers said they were working on the text of a unilateral declaration of independence that could be delivered next Tuesday. Meanwhile, the government has stepped up economic pressure on the region, passing a law making it easier to move their operations to other parts of Spain. The crisis even played out on the football pitch - with independence-backing Spain international Gerard Pique jeered by his own supporters during a match against Albania in Alicante. Mr Castro told Sky News: ""I think the action taken by the police last Sunday in Barcelona was absolutely proportionate. They were complying with the ruling of the court. ""Having people injured - not in the numbers the Catalan government said - is sad. We don't like that and we understand it's not pleasant to watch that on TV. ""But we do think the response was proportionate."" Asked about the possibility of Catalonia declaring independence, he added: ""The most important thing is to be within the frame of the Spanish constitution. ""You can disagree with the law, but you can not disobey the law. If you disobey the law, you become an outlaw."" He was speaking after Enric Millo, the Spanish government's representative in Catalonia, seemed to make a conciliatory gesture, telling a TV interviewer: ""When I see these images, and more so when I know people have been hit, pushed and even one person who was hospitalised, I can't help but regret it and apologise on behalf of the officers that intervened."" Carles Riera, a lawmaker from the pro-independence CUP (Popular Unity Candidacy), gave an update on plans to declare independence, saying: ""We are in talks about a text, with paper and pencil, on the declaration we want the regional parliament to accept on Tuesday. ""Nobody has put forward any scenario of delay, ambiguity or confusion. We are not working on that scenario."" Spain's ruling party says PM Mariano Rajoy is considering invoking the constitution to dissolve the regional parliament and force fresh Catalan elections if the region's government goes ahead with an independence declaration. Within hours of the government's declaration allowing companies to move their HQ, CaixaBank, Spain's third biggest lender and Catalonia's biggest company, said its board had decided to move its registered office to Valencia ""in light of the current political and social situation in Catalonia"". Catalonia-based utility Gas Natural said its board had decided to move its registered office to Madrid for as long as the legal uncertainty in Catalonia continued. They joined a number of other Catalonia-based companies, including Sabadell, Spain's fifth-largest lender, that have already announced plans this week to move their registered offices elsewhere in Spain."

He will be a hard act to replace."" :: Ryanair cancellations: Your rights Mr Hickey was in charge of pilot rotas when the disruptions began last month and did not have enough standby pilots to ensure the airline could operate properly, leading to the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights. More than 700,000 passengers' travel plans have been affected, but Ryanair has said 98% of customers hit by flight cancellations in September and October have been refunded or offered alternative transport. Last week, the firm confirmed it was suspending 34 of its routes over the November-March winter season to prevent any further mass cancellations.

He said: ""Sir Edward's reputation has been unfairly tarnished. ""No living person would be subject to a process which involves a trawl for accusations, followed by the publication of those accusations with no independent assessment of the 'evidence', or any details of the supposed place, time and circumstances of the alleged assaults. ""The fundamental principle that someone is innocent until proven guilty should apply to the dead as well as to the living; and no convincing evidence whatsoever against Sir Edward Heath has been produced."" He added: ""It is clear the report is the result of a fishing expedition that attracted more than 100 accusations which Wiltshire Police then spent two years and £1.5m sifting through. ""Only seven were regarded as sufficient even to meet the minimal standard of credibility and justifying a police interview if Sir Edward had still been alive - and the validity of some of these is now being seriously questioned."" Lord Hunt said the foundation would be writing to the Government seeking the appointment of a retired judge to review all material collected during the two-year Operation Conifer. ""Otherwise, Sir Edward's reputation will be left forever in limbo, unjustly tarnished,"" he said. The Operation Conifer report concluded that seven allegations against Sir Edward would have been sufficiently credible to justify questioning him under caution. It did not address his guilt or innocence, because its remit was to determine whether there was enough evidence to interview the former Bexley MP - prime minister between 1970 and 1974 - under caution. Among the allegations was the rape and indecent assault of an 11-year-old boy in 1961; indecent assault of a 10-year-old boy in 1962 and the indecent assault of a 15-year-old boy during paid sexual encounters in 1964. Sky News Correspondent Tom Parmenter said the foundation was ""not going to let this lie"". He said the IPCC complaint ""will look at many of the aspects of the investigation that they [the foundation] are not happy with, including that televised appeal outside Arundells, the former home of Sir Edward Heath in Salisbury, which they described as a 'crass' and 'prejudicial' move."" On Thursday, Wiltshire Chief Constable Mike Veale defended Operation Conifer. He said: ""Sir Edward Heath was an extremely prominent, influential and high-profile person who was arguably one of the most powerful people in the world commensurate with the political office he held. ""The allegations against him were of the utmost seriousness and from a significant number of people. ""I hope people will understand that, given these circumstances, it would be an indefensible dereliction of my public duty as a chief constable not to have investigated such serious allegations against a former prime minister, even though he is deceased."""

Hype followed by haplessness. Except it's happened so often now that even the hype isn't what it used to be. Watching the late, laboured, fortunate victory over Slovenia (world ranking 55) that confirmed England's passage to Russia next summer, one yearned for counter-arguments to the prevalent world-weary cynicism about our national team in our national sport. Few were forthcoming. So who can blame the football fan if he/she is more excited about the Premier League meeting of Liverpool and Manchester United on Saturday week, or Tottenham's trip to Real Madrid in the Champions League three days later. :: England qualify for 2018 World Cup in Russia Are there reasons for optimism despite all this? Some. Manager Gareth Southgate at least acknowledges there is a problem, and is in tune with his boss. Reflecting on England's ignominious exit at the hands of Iceland in last year's European Championships, FA chief executive Martin Glenn said: ""England players do not travel well. We know there is a brittleness in unfamiliar circumstances we have to deal with."" Brushing aside the argument that professional footballers ought not to faint at the prospect of playing significant matches in not-very-distant France, one could instead focus on England's bright emerging talents, coveted not just in this country but abroad too. There were occasional signs last night too that Tottenham's Harry Kane - who scored the very late match-winner at Wembley - might grow into a proper captain and leader. But a reminder that he is no Bobby Moore came this week when one of the surviving members of Moore's 1966 World Cup winners visited Southgate's men in training. Sir Bobby Charlton told them: ""I know that the manager has the ability and I do hope that you can give me one of the greatest memories of my life [by winning the trophy again]"". Current international Marcus Rashford described Sir Bobby's visit as ""the biggest inspiration we can have as players"". At Wembley last night, perspiration was much more in evidence. Southgate is under no illusions. ""This team has potential,"" the manager said, ""but we have a hell of a lot of work to do."" At least England will be in Russia next summer. Countries not yet certain to join them include the Netherlands, Portugal and Italy. And we can be reasonably confident that England fans will not cause the mayhem that an ugly minority wreaked in France last year. Russia's security forces will see to that."

Jurors at Snaresbrook Crown Court heard how she kissed the teenager in a classroom and had sex with him at an Ibis hotel. She also took the boy to her parents' home in Wanstead Park, east London. McBrearty pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to seven counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust. During Friday's sentencing, she put her head in her hands and sobbed in the dock as Judge Sheelagh Canavan jailed her. The judge said the woman was ""bright, intelligent and gifted"" and ""knew right from wrong"", but that she had committed the ""grossest breach of trust"".

Prosecutor Lisa Matthews said the boy ""felt special"" and was ""besotted"" with the teacher, who would take him to parks and for meals. The relationship ended when his father called the police. Emma Shafton, defending, said: ""This is a young lady who has had a spectacular fall from grace - university educated, comes from a respectable family - she has been utterly disgraced by this.""

Her naked, mutilated body was subsequently discovered in waters south of Copenhagen, missing its head, arms and legs. The latest discovery came in nearby waters on Friday, with the body parts found in plastic bags alongside a knife. They were weighed down with ""heavy metal pieces"" to make them sink. Danish police said there were no fractures in Ms Wall's cranium. Mr Madsen, who is in pre-trial detention, has been charged with the manslaughter of the 30-year-old. Police said 15 stab wounds were found on the previously discovered torso but a cause of death has yet to be determined. Testifying in court in September, Mr Madsen claimed she died after being hit by a hatch cover aboard his submarine. Private ships and the Danish navy were called to an emergency search for Mr Madsen's submarine when Ms Wall did not return home after interviewing the inventor. Mr Madsen was rescued from the vessel the following morning when it suddenly sank. Police concluded that the submarine - built and crowdfunded by Madsen himself - had been purposefully sunk. He first told police that Ms Wall had been safely dropped off near Copenhagen after the interview before claiming that she had died in an accident on board. Investigators later identified Ms Wall's body by DNA evidence, and revealed it had been attached to a piece of metal and cut in a way that attempted to ensure it would sink and remain on the sea bed. Ms Wall, 30, was a respected freelance journalist, who had reported from China, Uganda and Haiti for a wide range of publications, on topics including furries, feminism and voodoo. Commenting on her death, her family said her work had brought her to many dangerous places, but that it was ""unimaginable"" something could happen ""just a few miles from the childhood home""."

Employing more than 1,000 people across the UK, the company made pre-tax losses‎ totalling nearly £15m in the two-and-a-half years to April 2016. Monarch is understood to have accounted for a substantial proportion of Airline Services' revenues, although other notable contracts include a deal to design, manufacture and fit seats for British Airways. Other customers include easyJet and Virgin Atlantic, while it operates at airports including Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester. Insiders said that LDC, which has backed the business since 2012, had agreed to inject the additional capital ahead of a potential attempt to sell it. Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firms, have been engaged to assist LDC's efforts to restructure and offload Airline Services, they added. Shawbrook, Airline Services' main lender, is understood to be supportive of the rescue deal. The ground-handling provider's crunch talks over its future underline how the collapse of Monarch is already translating into financial‎ pain for its supply chain. Nearly 2,000 of Monarch's staff have already been made redundant by KPMG, the airline's administrator, as the Civil Aviation Authority approaches the halfway stage of a huge effort to repatriate more than 100,000 customers. ‎KPMG is expected to realise tens of millions of pounds for creditors in the coming weeks by auctioning Monarch's take-off and landing slots, although reports this week suggested that that process could be the subject of legal challenges. ‎Two trade unions are also preparing to take legal action over the way Monarch's staff were made redundant. There is also understood to be some degree of controversy over the fate of the airline's legacy pension scheme. Greybull Capital, which rescued Monarch in 2014, is facing losses totalling hundreds of millions of pounds from the company's demise, although it will have a substantial claim‎ on funds recovered for creditors. LDC could not be reached for comment this weekend."
2017-10-07,Stargazers could be in for a treat on Saturday as a meteor shower means dozens of shooting stars could be visible from the UK. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171008011306/http://news.sky.com/story/draconid-meteor-shower-to-light-up-skies-this-weekend-11069110,"The Draconid meteor shower happens every October and is caused by the comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, which orbits the Sun every 6.6 years. This weekend Earth will pass through the cloud of debris and space dust left behind by the comet. This will cause shooting stars to appear in the sky as the debris burns up after entering the atmosphere. The Draconid meteor shower has produced thousands of meteors an hour in peak years. But ""no outburst is predicted for this year"", according to astronomy website EarthSky. Instead, a handful of meteors is expected to be produced every hour. Stargazers hoping to spot shooting stars should look in the direction of the Draco constellation (the dragon) in the north sky. The meteor shower is named after the constellation because when the shooting stars appear they look like they are coming from the constellation. In years when the meteor shower is particularly strong the large number of shooting stars makes the dragon look like it is spitting fire. The best time to try and spot shooting stars will be just before nightfall when the Draco constellation will be highest in the sky. This year, a nearly full moon will make it harder to spot meteors as the night sky will be fairly light, but people in darker areas could still see shooting stars. Binoculars and telescopes are not needed as it is best to observe meteors with the naked eye. Anybody who misses this weekend's spectacle will get another chance to spot shooting stars later in the month. The Orionid meteor shower will take place and is expected to peak on 21 October."

Uncertainty over Mrs May's premiership has seen EU negotiators ""significantly"" increase the amount of talks held with Labour since the election, according to The Daily Telegraph. The discussions have marked ""a significant change in tone"" towards Labour, and Brussels is seeking assurances from Jeremy Corbyn that he would honour agreements made with the Conservatives if he comes to power, the paper added. :: Grant Shapps - Who is Tory MP leading plot against May? In July, Mr Corbyn held ""very frank"" talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier which lasted more than two hours. Speaking ahead of the visit, Mr Corbyn said Labour was ""a government in waiting"" ready to ""take up the responsibility for Brexit negotiations"". Mrs May has insisted she has the ""full support"" of her ministers despite a claim from former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps that ""one or two"" Cabinet ministers agreed she should step down. Only three Tory MPs have admitted to Sky News that they want Mrs May to resign immediately, with 100 others saying there should be no instant change to the leadership. One current MP and former minister denied to Sky News that they were behind any ""plot"", but added that the Prime Minister would find it ""very, very difficult to survive"". They said the ""image of her leaving Downing Street with tears in her eyes"" would have a profound effect on the party. :: Analysis - Will PM survive or choose to press eject herself?

Most MPs Sky News contacted said Mrs May should stay on for the good of party and country, praising her ""grit"" after a problem-plagued conference speech.

He told Tories to ""circle the wagons, turn the fire on Corbyn and talk about nothing except our great policies and what we can do for the country"". Mr Johnson, Andrea Leadsom and Ruth Davidson have rallied around Mrs May following her difficult speech at the party conference. Scottish Tory leader Ms Davidson, who has been tipped as a potential successor to Mrs May along with Mr Johnson, urged the party to ""settle down"". She hit out at plotters, saying: ""I really don't think that having a bit of a cold... when you are trying to make a speech changes the fundamentals of whether Theresa May is the right person to lead the country. ""I think there's an awful lot of people in our party that need to settle down."" Commons leader Ms Leadsom told former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps - the apparent ringleader behind a plot to oust Mrs May - to ""shut up"". She said: ""I don't think that there's anything like 30 others and I think what Grant Shapps is doing is incredibly unhelpful. ""Like a lot of my colleagues have said today, he should shut up."" Mr Johnson's response came after he faced calls to be sacked for destabilisng the party following his intervention on Brexit and controversial remarks on Libya at a fringe event. Mr Shapps, who claims to have the backing of about 30 MPs, including ""one or two"" Cabinet ministers, said demands for a leadership election were growing. Tory MP Michael Fabricant dismissed Mr Shapps as ""embittered"", while colleague Vicky Ford said the Welwyn Hatfield MP was ""completely out of touch""."

Police later confirmed the collision was a road traffic accident and was not being treated as terror-related. The incident in #ExhibitionRoad #SouthKensington earlier is not being treated as a terror-related incident. It is a road traffic collision. The incident was believed to have involved a black Toyota Prius, which collided with a silver Vauxhall saloon and a Jaguar. Of the 11 injured, nine have been taken to hospital, the London Ambulance Service said. Most of those hurt were treated for leg and head injuries. Earlier, a statement from the Metropolitan Police said: ""Police were called at 1421 on Saturday, 7 October to reports of a collision in Exhibition Road, South Kensington. ""It is believed that a number of pedestrians have been injured. Officers are on scene, and the London Ambulance Service have been called. ""A man has been detained at the scene.

In the speech the Prime Minister suggested there should be a transition period once the UK leaves the EU, which she referred to as an ""interim implementation period"". This would see the UK stay in the single market for two years after Brexit in exchange for continuing to pay into the EU budget and continuing to obey EU rules and regulations. :: EU 'steps up' Labour Brexit talks amid May 'plot' But when the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier met with ambassadors from the remaining 27 EU countries the idea was reportedly quickly rejected by Berlin and Paris. They reportedly said greater clarity was needed on the financial settlement, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens before the UK's future relationship with the EU could be discussed. The news will be a blow to the Government, which had hoped a transition deal could be quickly agreed, allowing more time to negotiate on controversial issues. The latest setback follows the claim that EU negotiators have stepped up backroom Brexit talks with Labour over concerns about Theresa May's future. The Prime Minister appeared to see off an attempted coup led by Grant Shapps on Friday after a troubled speech at the Tory party conference. She is due to meet business chiefs on Monday to reassure them that Brexit is on track. The latest positions from Germany and France may worry business leaders who have called for the Government to make it clear what the UK's relationship with the EU will be post-Brexit.

Bombardier is already facing a 220% tariff on a new model of passenger jet as part of a separate investigation into claims from US firm Boeing that it received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. The wings for the jet are made in Northern Ireland and Bombardier has said the C-Series model affected by the row is ""critical"" to its operations there. Bombardier is due to begin delivering a blockbuster order for up to 125 new planes to Atlanta-based Delta Airlines next year. Prime Minister Theresa May has lobbied President Donald Trump over the row, with Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon warning Boeing its actions could jeopardise future UK Government contracts. Announcing the latest tariff, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said: ""The United States is committed to free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada, but this is not our idea of a properly functioning trading relationship. ""We will continue to verify the accuracy of this decision, while doing everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers."" Washington said its move was out of concern to prevent ""injurious dumping"" - exporting a product to a country at a lower price - of imports into the US, ""establishing an opportunity to compete on a level playing field"". Bombardier did not provide the information requested, according to the Commerce Department. It added: ""The anti-dumping duty law provides US businesses and workers with a transparent, quasi-judicial, and internationally accepted mechanism to seek relief from the market-distorting effects caused by injurious dumping of imports into the United States."" Boeing alleges the unfair subsidy stems from when Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration and the UK Government pledged to invest nearly £135m to help set up a C-Series manufacturing site in Belfast. The firm also took umbrage with Bombardier receiving $1bn (£765m) from the Canadian provincial government in Quebec in 2015, when its fortunes appeared to be flagging. Boeing claims its complaint is a bid to seek a ""level playing field"" for global competitors, but Bombardier has accused its rival of hypocrisy. Trade unions expect a final ruling on the pricing policy in February."

He sought damages for the upkeep of the ""unwanted"" child born the following summer, but he lost his case on Friday. However, Mr Justice Jay said: ""Although he [ARB] has lost this case, my judgment must be seen as a complete personal and moral vindication for ARB. ""The same, of course, cannot be said for R."" ARB split from R, with who he already had a son by IVF, in May 2010. In October 2010, R handed the clinic a consent to thaw form, signed by her and purportedly signed by ARB. As a result, an embryo was thawed and successfully implanted. ARB alleged that R had forged his signature as the relationship had broken down - a claim denied by the woman. The judge concluded ARB did not sign the consent to thaw form in October or at all and that his signature was forged by R, but ruled out the clinic bearing any financial responsibility. He said the woman had ""resorted to desperate, dishonest measures"". Mr Justice Jay also declared that the clinic was ""not negligent"". He said: ""I have held that the clinic owed a strict contractual obligation to ARB to obtain his written consent to the procedure, and that the clinic is in breach of that obligation because it did not obtain it. ""I have also held that the clinic was not negligent. The claim fails owing to public policy. I have held that the principles underpinning two House of Lords' decisions in NHS claims given some 15 years ago apply equally to this contractual claim."" IVF Hammersmith's Jude Fleming said he was ""pleased"" with the result. In a statement, ARB said: ""We welcome this judgment, which has found in our favour in respect of all issues relating to our primary case. ""This claim has never been about money; it is about justice."" He indicated he would appeal over ""the isolated point of principle"" up to the Supreme Court if necessary."

2017-10-07,"""Productivity isn't everything,"" wrote the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, ""But in the long run it is almost everything.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171008011306/http://news.sky.com/story/productivity-decline-is-headache-for-hammond-11069356,"What he meant by that, he went on to say, is that a country's ability to improve its living standards over time depend almost entirely on its ability to raise output per worker. On that basis, latest productivity figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will not have been welcomed with much rejoicing in the Treasury. According to the ONS, productivity - as measured by output per worker per hour - during the second quarter of the year was 0.1% lower than in the first three months of the year. It wasn't all bad news: productivity in the services sector, which accounts for three-quarters of UK GDP, actually rose by 0.2%. But the overall figures were dragged down by a 1.3% drop in productivity in the manufacturing sector. This potentially creates a problem for Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, because next Tuesday the Office for Budget Responsibility - the body that provides independent oversight of the UK public finances - is due to publish analysis in which, according to a report in the Financial Times, it will admit that it has persistently over-estimated UK productivity. The expectation is that it will therefore downgrade its productivity forecasts for the year - and, with it, by extension, their growth forecasts. That will in turn impact the public finances and the Chancellor's ability to minimise any adverse impact of Brexit on the economy. The OBR was forecasting as recently as March that productivity would increase by 1.5% during the second quarter. For 2017 as a whole, the OBR has been forecasting productivity growth of 1.6%, followed by 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020. If those forecasts are revised lower, it is inevitable that lower forecasts for GDP growth will follow. As the OBR noted in July: ""If trend productivity and GDP growth were just 0.3 percentage points a year lower than we assume, half the £26bn of headroom the Government has against its structural deficit target for 2020-21 would be lost."" Why did productivity growth go backwards? Quite simply because the increase in the number of hours worked during the period was greater than the increase in economic output in that period. The figures confirm Britain's dismal productivity record in recent years. Output per worker per hour remains roughly the same as it was before the crisis. It is worth pointing out that this is not just a British problem. Since the global financial crisis, there has been slower growth in most major economies, including slower productivity growth. But the figures published by the ONS also offer an international comparison and this is by no means favourable to Britain. The ONS notes that the gap between productivity in Britain and the rest of the G7 advanced economies - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - narrowed last year. That's the good news. The bad news is that output per hour worked in the UK was 15.1% below the average for the rest of the G7 in 2016. The most popular way of expressing this productivity shortfall is to say that, roughly speaking, a French, German or American worker can produce as much in four days as a British worker does in five. Economists and politicians have spent many hours debating why UK productivity remains so poor compared with that of our major international competitors. One theory is that it is because, compared with a country like France, we prefer to have lower rates of unemployment. In France, where the jobless rate is more than double that of the UK's, the least productive workers are on the dole. In Britain, they go to work. But that doesn't explain the productivity shortfall with countries like the US and Germany that have comparable levels of unemployment with Britain. Another theory is that business investment in Britain lags that of competitor economies. In Britain, most GDP growth since the crisis has been due to more people entering the labour force - partly reflecting the UK's attractiveness to migrant workers - rather than more capital being invested. Another explanation could be that Britain is a smaller and more crowded country than our competitors. All the other G7 economies have lower population densities than Britain, with the exception of Japan, which has a similar productivity issue. Every traffic jam, every delay on the railways, every constraint on production caused by cramped office space, every delay to take-off and landing at the UK's airports all contributes to weaker productivity. And here's another possible explanation - while Britons are at work, some of them may not actually be doing very much. Early closing of shops in France does not necessarily mean lower retail sales overall - it simply means the same amount of shopping is packed into fewer hours. That would manifest itself in a French shop worker being more productive than their British equivalent. It all goes to show just what a nebulous subject productivity is - and why politicians of all parties have found it so hard, over the years, to inspire an improvement in it."

The incident led to him being arrested for public indecency. The 27-year-old electrician, from Stirling, has been stuck in the UAE since July after his passport was confiscated by authorities. He was initially locked up in Al Barsha prison for five days before being released on bail. Since then he has reportedly been forced to spend more than £30,000 in expenses and legal fees. The chief executive of Detained in Dubai, Radha Stirling, said: ""It is quite outrageous that he has been held in the country for so long already. ""This is another example of how vulnerable tourists are to arrest and detention in Dubai and at how drawn out and disorganised legal proceedings are."" As well as public indecency, Mr Harron is also facing a second charge relating to the drinking of alcohol. He was arrested while spending an evening at the Rock Bottom Bar. He is said to have held a hand in front of himself to prevent his drink spilling on anyone as he walked through the busy bar. In the process he ""touched a man on his hip to avoid impact"", before moving on and sitting down at a table with a friend. Detained in Dubai say it was only then that the man who had been touched seemed aggravated. He was arrested by police around 20 to 30 minutes later, his representatives say. Ms Stirling says she has spoken to Mr Harron recently and that he is under ""immense pressure and stress"". ""He was expecting to appear in court this Sunday, but the court moved the date without telling him or his lawyer,"" she said. ""This led to a sentence of 30 days' imprisonment for failing to present himself at the hearing.""

""This is the first technology that has become available which can actually reduce the cost by 50% or even more."" The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that women who meet the criteria are offered up to three rounds of IVF on the NHS, but it is up to clinical commissioning groups to decide whether to pay for it and in some parts of the country it is not available on the NHS at all. It means for some couples private treatment is the only option and it can cost thousands, or even tens of thousands of pounds. IVF patient Isabella Hatchard told Sky News costs can vary widely from clinic to clinic. ""I've had a cycle cost as little as £4,000 and another as much as £15,000,"" she said. ""It's actually quite a difficult process going through IVF, it's quite emotionally draining and I think to have certainty around the price is fantastic."" The idea for ""shoebox"" IVF came from a doctor who wanted to take the treatment to developing countries. Across the globe, some 90 babies have been conceived using the new treatment, but none in the UK. As well as being cheaper, the treatment requires women to have fewer injections. Sarah Norcross from Fertility Fairness, which campaigns for better access to IVF, is cautiously optimistic about its future. She said: ""It could really potentially shake up the industry and how we do things, but I want to have a bit of a note of caution in that so far fewer than 100 babies in the world have been born using this technique, whereas if you think there are more than six million born through conventional IVF. ""The data isn't there yet to say how successful it will be in comparison with standard treatments."""

Camille Simpson, from Slough, is hoping to become one of them. At just 25 and as an expectant mum, she recently set up an arts events management business with two friends. Now she spends her evenings and weekends networking, making phone calls from her living room and building her website. ""We started last year as a hobby, and we did our first event which was really successful,"" she says. Now, she's hoping to grow things further - but without giving up her product marketing manager's job just yet. ""At the moment I've got financial commitments and I need to have my full-time job. I'm not ready to take that step yet and go out there and do it full-time."" People like Camille are to be applauded, says Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, and author of a government-commissioned report into modern working practices. But he's also concerned that companies don't use the concept of a side hustle as an excuse not to pay their workers properly. He says the so-called ""gig economy"", where people work for websites or apps like Deliveroo or Uber, is different from a side hustle, where someone develops their own business idea. ""We don't want a situation in which ordinary work is being turned into gigs for people who are then denied the kinds of protections and rights they ought to have."" And for him, there's also an issue of well-being at stake. ""I'd be concerned if people doing full-time jobs are then working lots of hours in the evenings and weekends in order to make ends meet because that's ultimately not going to be good for them and they won't be very productive either."" Some economists are also worried about the concept of a side hustle. Annie Quick from the New Economics Foundation says: ""For many more people this is something they're being forced to do. ""We've had a decade now of stagnating wages, benefit cuts, and increasing prices so many people are finding that a full-time job is no longer enough to put food on the table and are often having to turn to often poorly paid, insecure employment to top up their income."" Camille's side hustle may not be paying her much just yet, but she sees it as a potential route to her dream career. For others, though, the concern is that side hustles don't become an excuse for full-time stress and exploitation."
2017-10-08,"""Productivity isn't everything,"" wrote the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, ""But in the long run it is almost everything.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171009020057/http://news.sky.com/story/productivity-decline-is-headache-for-hammond-11069356,"What he meant by that, he went on to say, is that a country's ability to improve its living standards over time depend almost entirely on its ability to raise output per worker. On that basis, latest productivity figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will not have been welcomed with much rejoicing in the Treasury. According to the ONS, productivity - as measured by output per worker per hour - during the second quarter of the year was 0.1% lower than in the first three months of the year. It wasn't all bad news: productivity in the services sector, which accounts for three-quarters of UK GDP, actually rose by 0.2%. But the overall figures were dragged down by a 1.3% drop in productivity in the manufacturing sector. This potentially creates a problem for Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, because next Tuesday the Office for Budget Responsibility - the body that provides independent oversight of the UK public finances - is due to publish analysis in which, according to a report in the Financial Times, it will admit that it has persistently over-estimated UK productivity. The expectation is that it will therefore downgrade its productivity forecasts for the year - and, with it, by extension, their growth forecasts. That will in turn impact the public finances and the Chancellor's ability to minimise any adverse impact of Brexit on the economy. The OBR was forecasting as recently as March that productivity would increase by 1.5% during the second quarter. For 2017 as a whole, the OBR has been forecasting productivity growth of 1.6%, followed by 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020. If those forecasts are revised lower, it is inevitable that lower forecasts for GDP growth will follow. As the OBR noted in July: ""If trend productivity and GDP growth were just 0.3 percentage points a year lower than we assume, half the £26bn of headroom the Government has against its structural deficit target for 2020-21 would be lost."" Why did productivity growth go backwards? Quite simply because the increase in the number of hours worked during the period was greater than the increase in economic output in that period. The figures confirm Britain's dismal productivity record in recent years. Output per worker per hour remains roughly the same as it was before the crisis. It is worth pointing out that this is not just a British problem. Since the global financial crisis, there has been slower growth in most major economies, including slower productivity growth. But the figures published by the ONS also offer an international comparison and this is by no means favourable to Britain. The ONS notes that the gap between productivity in Britain and the rest of the G7 advanced economies - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - narrowed last year. That's the good news. The bad news is that output per hour worked in the UK was 15.1% below the average for the rest of the G7 in 2016. The most popular way of expressing this productivity shortfall is to say that, roughly speaking, a French, German or American worker can produce as much in four days as a British worker does in five. Economists and politicians have spent many hours debating why UK productivity remains so poor compared with that of our major international competitors. One theory is that it is because, compared with a country like France, we prefer to have lower rates of unemployment. In France, where the jobless rate is more than double that of the UK's, the least productive workers are on the dole. In Britain, they go to work. But that doesn't explain the productivity shortfall with countries like the US and Germany that have comparable levels of unemployment with Britain. Another theory is that business investment in Britain lags that of competitor economies. In Britain, most GDP growth since the crisis has been due to more people entering the labour force - partly reflecting the UK's attractiveness to migrant workers - rather than more capital being invested. Another explanation could be that Britain is a smaller and more crowded country than our competitors. All the other G7 economies have lower population densities than Britain, with the exception of Japan, which has a similar productivity issue. Every traffic jam, every delay on the railways, every constraint on production caused by cramped office space, every delay to take-off and landing at the UK's airports all contributes to weaker productivity. And here's another possible explanation - while Britons are at work, some of them may not actually be doing very much. Early closing of shops in France does not necessarily mean lower retail sales overall - it simply means the same amount of shopping is packed into fewer hours. That would manifest itself in a French shop worker being more productive than their British equivalent. It all goes to show just what a nebulous subject productivity is - and why politicians of all parties have found it so hard, over the years, to inspire an improvement in it."
2017-10-08,"When contemplating death, it's never a question of 'if', simply 'when' and 'how'. A political demise is no different.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171009020057/http://news.sky.com/story/the-risky-move-that-secured-theresa-mays-survival-for-now-11072444,"Theresa May's political death is, by definition, a certainty. But it seems it will not come right at this moment, nor will it be at the hands of Grant Shapps. She owes her survival to the effective, if risky, decision to get the party whips to expose the Shapps plot. The calculation: that publicising her detractors was a price worth paying if it meant figures with more deadly potential felt the need to distance themselves from a half-cocked coup. And it worked. Now the Prime Minister's loyalists can dismiss the plot as the scheming of an unrepresentative minority. Speaking on Sunday with Niall Paterson, Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said: ""We're talking about less than 10% of the parliamentary party potentially, maybe, possibly looking for her to move on. That's not a very large number when you look at the other nearly 300 that are determined to keep her in place"". But in the flurry of anonymous mutterings reported through the political pages of the Sunday newspapers, there is a sense that the public support is conditional. One unnamed Cabinet minister, speaking to The Sunday Times, is reported to have said: ""Whether it's on Brexit or domestic policy, nothing is happening, no grip is being exercised, no leadership is being shown."" So it is perhaps with that underlying narrative in mind that the Prime Minister will seek to demonstrate there is still blood pulsing through her political muscles by flexing them in a reshuffle. A shake-up of her top team is something many have called for since the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson made his various Brexit interventions at key moments that were seen to undermine the Prime Minister. That she did not sack him was put down to the weakness of her political position. The only thing that appears to have changed is that Mrs May now knows she might have to do it regardless. In an interview with The Sunday Times, she said: ""It has never been my style to hide from a challenge and I'm not going to start now. I'm the PM, and part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my Cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available to me in the party."" That has been interpreted as the clearest sign yet that change is afoot, and Mrs May will be hoping that any political risk in shuffling her Foreign Secretary in favour of the new generation will be countered by vocal support from those in the party he has irked. Leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson certainly gave the impression she could be counted among that number. When asked about the Foreign Secretary's future, she told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""He's come out this week to say he's fully behind every dot, comma and word of the Florence Speech... and I want to see the Prime Minister hold him to that"". But the timing could, as ever, be a problem. Reports suggest any reshuffle would likely take place after the EU Council summit due to be held in Brussels later this month. If EU leaders continue to demand the UK commits to a financial settlement well beyond the €20bn put down in her Florence speech in order for talks to move on to trade and the transition, the Prime Minister will be left in a near impossible position. Forced to choose between agreeing to pay more, but losing the support of the Brexiteer hardliners in her party who would prefer no deal to a costly one, or opting for no deal and seeing the moderates and opposition parties rise up in fury. The Prime Minister has indicated she's determined to survive a little longer, or at the very least feels she has a duty to do so. A reshuffle might enable her to do that, but there remains a chance she could yet be killed off by her own before she even gets the chance."

I'm not at all surprised to see it."" The comments coincide with the anniversary of the publication of the 2005 Access Hollywood video in which Mr Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals. The President again dismissed the tape's contents as typical male bragging, saying - as he did at the time - ""that's locker room"". His intervention comes after Mr Weinstein's latest accuser, TV presenter Lauren Sivan, claimed he cornered her in a Manhattan restaurant in 2007 and tried to kiss her. When she refused, he said: ""Well, can you just stand there and shut up."" He then allegedly performed a sex act in front of her. She joins other women, including actors Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, in accusing the film producer of sexual harassment stretching back years. In another blow to Mr Weinstein, his lawyer, Lisa Bloom, has quit representing him. She had been criticised for staying with Weinstein after the allegations surfaced.

But now 17 of the 20 council leaders in the region are backing a move towards having an elected mayor similar to those in London and Manchester. The proposed model for devolution would involve a mayor with an accompanying Yorkshire cabinet made of council leaders. They would be in control of an annual budget of £100m, with powers over issues such as transport, education, and business rates. Its supporters say it could double Yorkshire's current economic output over the next 30 years. This week's meeting in Westminster has been tabled by Labour's MP for Keighley, John Grogan. ""Here in Yorkshire we feel we've got a population of five million, about as big as Scotland, a £100bn economy, a big strong identity,"" he said. ""But we're losing out on investment and so on because we haven't got devolution."" The Yorkshire Party was formed to push for a greater voice for a region that has the same population as Scotland, and an economy bigger than that of several EU countries. Party leader Stewart Arnold says that in the last couple of months he has felt more confidence than ever that Yorkshire will get devolved powers. But he'd like to see Yorkshire be given more control. To make it similar to Scotland and Wales rather than London or Manchester. ""Something like an assembly or a parliament which is directly elected with fair votes, and reflects the kind of diversity of opinion which is obvious in somewhere like Yorkshire,"" he said. Yorkshire is huge, and is incredibly diverse. Both are potential problems for an elected leader to negotiate in order to keep everyone happy. From farmers to fishermen, factory workers to financiers, many Yorkshiremen and women think the region has the resources, and the potential, to become something akin to a country in its own right. And there is still an underlying feeling that the north-south divide is as effective as ever in holding them back. But now that the infighting seems to be over, there is a cross-party feeling that it's more of a ""when"" than an ""if"" where Yorkshire's devolution is concerned. If so, then the political parties may soon find themselves having to select candidates for the second most powerful mayoral job in the country, in charge of a £100bn a year economy. Names mentioned so far include former frontbench MPs Ed Balls and William Hague, along with serving MPs Dan Jarvis and John Tricket, and the man who brought the Tour de France to Yorkshire, Sir Gary Verity. The MPs' devolution discussion takes place this Tuesday."

But ""no outburst is predicted for this year"", according to astronomy website EarthSky. Instead, a handful of meteors is expected to be produced every hour. Stargazers hoping to spot shooting stars should look in the direction of the Draco constellation (the dragon) in the north sky. The meteor shower is named after the constellation because when the shooting stars appear they look like they are coming from the constellation. In years when the meteor shower is particularly strong the large number of shooting stars makes the dragon look like it is spitting fire. The best time to try and spot shooting stars will be just before nightfall when the Draco constellation will be highest in the sky. This year, a nearly full moon will make it harder to spot meteors as the night sky will be fairly light, but people in darker areas could still see shooting stars. Binoculars and telescopes are not needed as it is best to observe meteors with the naked eye. Anybody who misses this weekend's spectacle will get another chance to spot shooting stars later in the month. The Orionid meteor shower will take place and is expected to peak on 21 October."

Thirty-three percent say it would make no difference, while 8% said they did not know. Mrs May has faced increasing pressure from some Tory MPs to step down, following a snap general election in which the party lost its majority in Parliament, and a party conference speech widely deemed as catastrophic. However, voters are split on when, if at all, the Prime Minister should leave her post. A third of voters think she should resign immediately (35%); another third think she should not go before the next general election (36%). A further 6% believe Mrs May should not resign immediately, but should go before the official scheduled date for Brexit in March 2019. Meanwhile, some 14% think she should go after Brexit but before the next general election. Were she to resign, there is little enthusiasm for any of the politicians most likely to succeed her. Boris Johnson is the public's favourite, with 23% saying they would most prefer him of the top five bookies' favourites to succeed Mrs May if forced to choose. The Foreign Secretary polled ahead of Home Secretary Amber Rudd (12%), Chancellor Philip Hammond (11%), Brexit Secretary David Davis (8%), and backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg (5%). Some 41% answered 'don't know', suggesting none of Mrs May's potential successors have truly caught the public's imagination yet.

2017-10-08,Hundreds of thousands of people are marching in Barcelona to demand Catalonia rejects independence and stays with Spain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171009020057/http://news.sky.com/story/huge-demonstration-against-catalan-independence-in-barcelona-11072314,"March organisers Societat Civil Catalana claimed 930,000 people turned out, but Barcelona police put the total at around 350,000. The demonstration comes a week after the Catalan government held a referendum on secession that was condemned as illegal and unconstitutional by the Spanish government. The vote, which was won by the Yes side, was broken up by police, who beat voters with batons. The tactic was condemned throughout the world but a Spanish minister told Sky News it was ""absolutely proportionate"". On Saturday, a similarly large rally was held in the city to demand secession from Spain, while another demonstration was held in support of Spanish unity in Madrid. Speaking to El Pais on Sunday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said: ""Spain is not going to be divided and the nation's unity will be maintained. ""The ideal would be not to have to take drastic measures. I would like this threat of a declaration of independence to be withdrawn as quickly as possible."" Those measures could include taking over the regional government's powers, a move that could deepen the country's worst political crisis in a generation. The slogan for the Barcelona protest, which was organised by the Societat Civil Catalana, the main anti-independence group in Catalonia, was ""Enough, let's recover good sense!"" But some people went further, chanting ""Don't be fooled, Catalonia is Spain"" and calling for Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to be jailed. Mr Puigdemont is set to address the Catalan parliament on Tuesday, and although it remains unclear what he plans to say, many secessionists are urging him to declare unilateral independence. Weighing against that is the decision of several large businesses, including Catalonia's top two banks, to pull out of the region amid the uncertainty over its future. Other companies are reportedly considering leaving Catalonia to avoid being forced to leave the European Union and the single market in the case of secession. Mr Rajoy told Catalan leaders that there ""is still time"" to backtrack and avoid Madrid taking over the region's government. Though 90% of voters backed independence at the outlawed referendum, fewer than half of the region's electorate voted. Most recent polls showed that Catalonia's 7.5m residents were roughly split down the middle over secession."

But senior Conservatives loyal to the Prime Minister are striving to move on from the party's post-conference turmoil, with Culture Secretary Karen Bradley claiming more than 90% of Tory MPs are in support of Mrs May. :: Britons think May exit would be bad for Brexit Speaking on Sky News' Niall Paterson, Mrs Bradley claimed Mrs May will ""absolutely"" still be Prime Minister at Christmas, despite opponents attacking the Prime Minister as ""very weak"" and without control over her party. ""This is a woman who puts public service and the country before anything else, she is as resilient as anybody,"" she said. ""I'm absolutely certain she will keep on going."" On Mrs May's internal party critics, Mrs Bradley suggested there are ""less than 10% of the parliamentary party potentially, maybe, possibly looking for her to move on"". ""That's not a very large number when you look at another nearly 300 who are determined to keep her in place,"" she added. ""This is about the country and putting the country first, we need to get that deal for Brexit and we need to deliver on our policies."" In a Sunday newspaper interview, Mrs May insisted she is ""not someone who gives up"" as she suggested she is prepared to demote Boris Johnson from his role as Foreign Secretary in a Cabinet reshuffle. Speaking to Sky News, former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine criticised Mr Johnson. When asked where Mrs May should put Mr Johnson in a possible Cabinet shake-up, the Tory peer quipped ""Mongolia"". Mrs Bradley, who served the PM during their time together in the Home Office, dismissed reshuffle talk as ""speculation"", but delivered a public rebuke to Mr Johnson over his controversial remarks at a Conservative conference fringe event. The Foreign Secretary suggested Libya's city Sirte could become ""the next Dubai"" once they ""clear the dead bodies away"", to some laughter from an audience. But the Culture Secretary said: ""I don't think it was witty, I don't think it was funny."" Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also voiced her ""full support"" for the Prime Minister on Sunday, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday programme: ""She has got grit, determination, dignity, she believes in service and diligence and she absolutely has my support."" Appearing earlier on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Ms Davidson reminded her Tory colleagues they are ""really lucky to serve our country"", adding: ""It is all about delivering for the country and not about personal ambition."" But Mrs May's troubled week was seized on by political opponents, with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon telling the same programme the Tory leader is ""a very weak Prime Minister presiding over a totally divided party"". ""If that was just a problem for the Conservative Party I wouldn't be particularly bothered, but it's a massive problem for the country at the moment,"" the SNP politician added. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told Sky News' Niall Paterson the Prime Minister ""doesn't have enough authority"" and ""can't lead her party"". Claiming the Tories are ""in all sorts of trouble"" over Brexit, Ms Thornberry added: ""It doesn't really matter who their leader is, they don't know where they are going."""

He said: ""Sir Edward's reputation has been unfairly tarnished. ""No living person would be subject to a process which involves a trawl for accusations, followed by the publication of those accusations with no independent assessment of the 'evidence', or any details of the supposed place, time and circumstances of the alleged assaults. ""The fundamental principle that someone is innocent until proven guilty should apply to the dead as well as to the living; and no convincing evidence whatsoever against Sir Edward Heath has been produced."" He added: ""It is clear the report is the result of a fishing expedition that attracted more than 100 accusations which Wiltshire Police then spent two years and £1.5m sifting through. ""Only seven were regarded as sufficient even to meet the minimal standard of credibility and justifying a police interview if Sir Edward had still been alive - and the validity of some of these is now being seriously questioned."" Lord Hunt said the foundation would be writing to the Government seeking the appointment of a retired judge to review all material collected during the two-year Operation Conifer. ""Otherwise, Sir Edward's reputation will be left forever in limbo, unjustly tarnished,"" he said. The Operation Conifer report concluded that seven allegations against Sir Edward would have been sufficiently credible to justify questioning him under caution. It did not address his guilt or innocence, because its remit was to determine whether there was enough evidence to interview the former Bexley MP - prime minister between 1970 and 1974 - under caution. Among the allegations was the rape and indecent assault of an 11-year-old boy in 1961; indecent assault of a 10-year-old boy in 1962 and the indecent assault of a 15-year-old boy during paid sexual encounters in 1964. Sky News Correspondent Tom Parmenter said the foundation was ""not going to let this lie"". He said the IPCC complaint ""will look at many of the aspects of the investigation that they [the foundation] are not happy with, including that televised appeal outside Arundells, the former home of Sir Edward Heath in Salisbury, which they described as a 'crass' and 'prejudicial' move."" On Thursday, Wiltshire Chief Constable Mike Veale defended Operation Conifer. He said: ""Sir Edward Heath was an extremely prominent, influential and high-profile person who was arguably one of the most powerful people in the world commensurate with the political office he held. ""The allegations against him were of the utmost seriousness and from a significant number of people. ""I hope people will understand that, given these circumstances, it would be an indefensible dereliction of my public duty as a chief constable not to have investigated such serious allegations against a former prime minister, even though he is deceased."""

He told Tories to ""circle the wagons, turn the fire on Corbyn and talk about nothing except our great policies and what we can do for the country"". Mr Johnson, Andrea Leadsom and Ruth Davidson have rallied around Mrs May following her difficult speech at the party conference. Scottish Tory leader Ms Davidson, who has been tipped as a potential successor to Mrs May along with Mr Johnson, urged the party to ""settle down"". She hit out at plotters, saying: ""I really don't think that having a bit of a cold... when you are trying to make a speech changes the fundamentals of whether Theresa May is the right person to lead the country. ""I think there's an awful lot of people in our party that need to settle down."" Commons leader Ms Leadsom told former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps - the apparent ringleader behind a plot to oust Mrs May - to ""shut up"". She said: ""I don't think that there's anything like 30 others and I think what Grant Shapps is doing is incredibly unhelpful. ""Like a lot of my colleagues have said today, he should shut up."" Mr Johnson's response came after he faced calls to be sacked for destabilisng the party following his intervention on Brexit and controversial remarks on Libya at a fringe event. Mr Shapps, who claims to have the backing of about 30 MPs, including ""one or two"" Cabinet ministers, said demands for a leadership election were growing. Tory MP Michael Fabricant dismissed Mr Shapps as ""embittered"", while colleague Vicky Ford said the Welwyn Hatfield MP was ""completely out of touch""."

Bombardier is already facing a 220% tariff on a new model of passenger jet as part of a separate investigation into claims from US firm Boeing that it received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. The wings for the jet are made in Northern Ireland and Bombardier has said the C-Series model affected by the row is ""critical"" to its operations there. Bombardier is due to begin delivering a blockbuster order for up to 125 new planes to Atlanta-based Delta Airlines next year. Prime Minister Theresa May has lobbied President Donald Trump over the row, with Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon warning Boeing its actions could jeopardise future UK Government contracts. Announcing the latest tariff, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said: ""The United States is committed to free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada, but this is not our idea of a properly functioning trading relationship. ""We will continue to verify the accuracy of this decision, while doing everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers."" Washington said its move was out of concern to prevent ""injurious dumping"" - exporting a product to a country at a lower price - of imports into the US, ""establishing an opportunity to compete on a level playing field"". Bombardier did not provide the information requested, according to the Commerce Department. It added: ""The anti-dumping duty law provides US businesses and workers with a transparent, quasi-judicial, and internationally accepted mechanism to seek relief from the market-distorting effects caused by injurious dumping of imports into the United States."" Boeing alleges the unfair subsidy stems from when Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration and the UK Government pledged to invest nearly £135m to help set up a C-Series manufacturing site in Belfast. The firm also took umbrage with Bombardier receiving $1bn (£765m) from the Canadian provincial government in Quebec in 2015, when its fortunes appeared to be flagging. Boeing claims its complaint is a bid to seek a ""level playing field"" for global competitors, but Bombardier has accused its rival of hypocrisy. Trade unions expect a final ruling on the pricing policy in February."

The ship's fuel tanks were not damaged and the risk to the environment from pollution was assessed as very low. The vessel, which was travelling to Antwerp, Belgium, where its cargo was set to be recycled, has now been refloated with the help of a tug. A Coastguard spokeswoman said: ""At 2.20pm the Maritime and Coastguard Agency reported that the Islay Trader had been successfully refloated at high water with the aid of a tug, and towed to deeper water. ""The vessel will now conduct a survey to assess its suitability for onward passage to Belgium, where it will offload its cargo and then enter a dry dock in order to conduct a full inspection.""

It will also clarify the force responsible for further action in each case. The move is part of a drive to improve support for victims and increase prosecutions of trolls who abuse others online over their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. Ms Rudd said: ""What is illegal offline is illegal online, and those who commit these cowardly crimes should be met with the full force of the law. ""The national online hate crime hub that we are funding is an important step to ensure more victims have the confidence to come forward and report the vile abuse to which they are being subjected. She added: ""The hub will also improve our understanding of the scale and nature of this despicable form of abuse. ""With the police, we will use this new intelligence to adapt our response so that even more victims are safeguarded and perpetrators punished."" National Police Chiefs' Council lead for hate crime, assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton, said the hub would ""reduce the burden on frontline officers and help bring more offenders to justice"". He added: ""We recognise and will uphold the right to free speech even where it causes offence - but this does not extend to inciting hatred or threatening people."" In 2015/16, a total of 62,518 hate crimes were recorded by forces in England and Wales, while the CPS completed 15,442 hate crime prosecutions.

Sorry, but only one thing will work! Although Mr Trump did not make clear what his hint meant, the suggestion of military measures was quickly inferred. Mr Trump and North Korea have been engaged in an escalating war of words in recent months, with the President arguing for decisive military action against the state over its nuclear missile programme. In his UN General Assembly address last month, the US leader threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea, saying ""the United States is ready, willing and able (to act), but hopefully this will not be necessary"". Mr Trump also told a recent gathering of journalists that this period ""could be the calm before the storm"". While he did not explain his comments further, a White House spokeswoman said they likely referred to Iran and North Korea.

He called the move a ""further consolidation of the Kim family's power"". Ms Kim was one of several North Korean officials blacklisted by the US Treasury in January over ""severe human rights abuses"". State media is reporting that Mr Kim addressed the ""complicated international situation"" during the party meeting. He called the country's nuclear weapons a ""powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia"". Pyongyang is attempting to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the US mainland. In the past few weeks they have launched two missiles over Japan and conducted their sixth nuclear test, escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and with the United States. Kim's comments were made before US President Donald Trump tweeted that diplomacy with Pyongyang had failed and that ""only one thing will work"" when dealing with North Korea.

In the speech the Prime Minister suggested there should be a transition period once the UK leaves the EU, which she referred to as an ""interim implementation period"". This would see the UK stay in the single market for two years after Brexit in exchange for continuing to pay into the EU budget and continuing to obey EU rules and regulations. :: EU 'steps up' Labour Brexit talks amid May 'plot' But when the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier met with ambassadors from the remaining 27 EU countries the idea was reportedly quickly rejected by Berlin and Paris. They reportedly said greater clarity was needed on the financial settlement, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens before the UK's future relationship with the EU could be discussed. The news will be a blow to the Government, which had hoped a transition deal could be quickly agreed, allowing more time to negotiate on controversial issues. The latest setback follows the claim that EU negotiators have stepped up backroom Brexit talks with Labour over concerns about Theresa May's future. The Prime Minister appeared to see off an attempted coup led by Grant Shapps on Friday after a troubled speech at the Tory party conference. She is due to meet business chiefs on Monday to reassure them that Brexit is on track. The latest positions from Germany and France may worry business leaders who have called for the Government to make it clear what the UK's relationship with the EU will be post-Brexit. This week Germany's biggest business lobby group warned companies operating in the UK to prepare for a ""very hard Brexit""."
2017-10-08,The SNP is holding its conference in Glasgow amidst increased doubts over the prospect of a second independence referendum.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171009020057/http://news.sky.com/story/snp-conference-gets-under-way-amid-tinderbox-of-possibility-11071946,"An eve-of-conference poll by YouGov for The Times suggests that Nicola Sturgeon's party will lose its pro-independence majority in Holyrood at the next Scottish Parliamentary elections. It would undermine any effort to push for a referendum following the elections in 2021, as the Holyrood chamber would almost certainly block any attempt to secure a mandate for any referendum bid. Prominent figures in the SNP view 2021 as the next realistic platform for a referendum, after the plan was shelved following their losses in June's Westminster election. Having previously demanded a referendum by spring 2019, Ms Sturgeon has said she will wait until the outcome of Brexit is clear before deciding on her next move. As SNP delegates gather in Glasgow, there is criticism in the wider independence movement of Ms Sturgeon's stewardship of the project. Colin Fox, of the Scottish Socialist Party, told Sky News: ""I think she's made a number of mistakes. I think, perhaps, the biggest difficulty the independence movement faces now is it's effectively been tangled together with the SNP. It was a movement for independence that became a political party and the choices that political parties make are different from the choices that movements make. ""You have to be big enough to admit your mistakes. The independence movement has not sufficiently examined why it lost in 2014. In my view, it lost because it presented a very conservative, with a small 'c', prospectus. We'll keep the pound, we'll keep the Queen, we'll keep NATO, we'll keep neoliberal corporations in charge - that isn't sufficient to persuade working-class Scotland, which makes up the majority, that their lives will be transformed."" The issue of Scottish independence is not on the agenda for debate in the main hall at this SNP conference. Naturally, however, a referendum - and when to hold one - is the subject of ongoing discussion in party circles. Kevin Pringle is a columnist for The Sunday Times (Scotland) and formerly the SNP's communications director who remains an influential figure in the party. He told Sky News: ""We're now in a debate about the timescale of another referendum. I'm convinced there will be one. It's a question of whether it will be before the next Holyrood election or, perhaps more likely, after the next Holyrood election. ""The really important issue is if you look at the period since the last referendum, there have been three years now of support for independence being around the level it was at the time of the referendum - about 45%, last poll was 46%. In other words, support for independence in Scotland has never been this high for this long on Scottish political history and that's, of course, over a period when there hasn't been any formal campaigning for it. ""So I think when you've got that continuing very, very high level of support for independence, I think it is unavoidable that it must be put to the test again in a future referendum to see whether people do want to be part of Brexit Britain and all the problems and issues attached to that or if they want to choose a different future."" During its conference, the SNP will commit to efforts to secure the status of EU citizens in Scotland. It will pledge to meet the cost of EU nationals working in the public sector, should any charges arise as a result of UK Government policy. The three-day conference begins as a constitutional stand-off intensifies in Catalonia. Lesley Riddoch, a journalist and campaigner for Scottish independence, believes that events on the Iberian Peninsula will resonate in Scotland. She told Sky News: ""The political situation is so incredibly fluid at the moment. If you look at the Catalan situation, it's making a lot of people think again about how a nation, a region, behaves, when it's denied its desire to move towards a referendum. In terms of the percentage support there seems to be for independence, it's not that far away from where Scotland is. ""There's 45% that's never gone away and there's a very volatile situation. Theresa May is a dead prime minister walking. The only thing that's keeping her in office is the grandees fear of Boris Johnson being made prime minister or Jeremy Corbyn winning an election. Now, all of that is a tinderbox of possibility."""

On a visit to Imperial College London's Data Observatory on Friday, William learned about the campaign's progress in its drive to ""change the conversation on mental health"". He was shown a collection of data visualisations from the biggest ever series of surveys on mental health involving 14,000 members of the British public. The surveys suggested that a total 1.5 million more people (3%) were talking about mental health in May compared to February 2017, when the surveys were launched, with a 12% increase in the number of those admitting to talking about their own mental health. After hearing about the work of the campaign, William said: ""Wow. Lots of figures. Amazing,"" and added that it had been ""fantastic"" to see data about the campaign's impact around the UK. The Mix, one of their eight charity partners, offers advice to teenagers and young people who already use their phones, social media and online search engines to find support. Chris Martin, CEO of The Mix, said: ""The potential of these technologies is developing all the time and - increasingly - young people turn to these channels first when they are struggling. ""Now is the perfect moment for The Royal Foundation to help kick-start the creation of impactful new tools that will help young people have conversations about their mental health and find the support they need, when they need it."" On Tuesday William, Kate and Harry will mark world mental health day, which this year focuses on workplace wellbeing. In the coming weeks and months they are expected to make more announcements about how they are going to focus on what resources are needed in the workplace, in schools and within the military, to make mental wellbeing a priority and make sure everyone can get access to the help they need."
2017-10-08,Scotland's deputy first minister has jokingly compared Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson to controversial commentator Katie Hopkins as he announced a new bursary scheme for teachers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171009020057/http://news.sky.com/story/snp-conference-ruth-davidson-jokingly-compared-to-katie-hopkins-11072623,"Speaking on the first day of the SNP's annual conference in Glasgow, Scottish Government Education Secretary John Swinney urged party members to ignore the ""deliberate misrepresentation"" of the country's schools' standards by political opponents. Turning his fire on rival parties in a strident defence of the SNP's education record, the MSP quipped: ""We will not be listening to right-wing, educationally ill-informed Twitter personalities who haven't done their homework. ""And no, I don't mean Katie Hopkins. I mean Ruth Davidson."" Mr Swinney insisted Scotland ""has a fundamentally strong education system"" as he used his conference speech to announce a new bursary scheme for those looking to move into teaching from other careers, worth £20,000 per person. The scheme will be focused on recruiting science, technology, engineering and maths teachers, with Mr Swinney pledging a ""relentless focus"" on handing ""more power and more resources"" to teachers. Education standards have become a bitter battleground for Scottish politicians since the country's schools recorded their worst ever performance in an influential international survey of pupils in December last year. At the time, the SNP - which has been in power at Holyrood since 2007 - admitted the results made ""uncomfortable reading"". Last month, teaching unions and the Scottish Government issued a warning to state schools after Ms Hopkins offered free talks to pupils aged 14 to 16 on controversial subjects such as Brexit, Donald Trump and the Black Lives Matter campaign. The columnist recently left her job with LBC Radio after suggesting a ""final solution"" was needed in the wake of the Manchester Arena terror attack. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives told Sky News: ""John Swinney is one of the more credible Nat MSPs. ""But this shows what can happen even to people like him when the only thing they've ever cared about politically is slipping away."" Mr Swinney also used his conference speech to call for the SNP to ""rededicate ourselves to independence"", despite their conference being held amid fresh doubts over the prospect of a second referendum on the issue. Earlier, SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told ITV it would be ""premature"" to set a date for another independence vote, despite having previously said a referendum should be held between autumn 2018 and spring 2019. Ms Sturgeon, who has seen her party lose seats at both Westminster and Edinburgh in recent elections, admitted she had ""accepted"" the Scottish Government ""need to let the dust settle"" on the ""uncertainty of Brexit"" but insisted she still has a ""mandate"" to call a vote. Labour and the Tories hit out at Ms Sturgeon for not ruling out a second independence vote in the lifetime of the current Scottish parliament."

It is the first time a hurricane has made landfall in Mississippi since Katrina caused widespread flooding and loss of life in 2005.  #hurricanenate at #thehardrockcafe in #biloxi A post shared by SupaLyft (@mreedy02) on Oct 7, 2017 at 9:58pm PDT Nate had already made landfall earlier on Saturday night at the mouth of the Mississippi River in southeast Louisiana. It was later downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland over Mississippi and Alabama. At 4am local time (9am GMT) Nate was around 80 miles from Biloxi, and was travelling north-northeast. It had weakened slightly and had maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110kph), according to the National Hurricane Centre. Nate has already killed at least 30 people in Central America and is the fourth major storm to hit the US in less than two months. The storm surge from Nate caused flooding along the seafront in Bliloxi, and across communities in Mississippi and Alabama. ""We have a restaurant and one of our main bars open so they have been okay so far,"" said Chett Harrison, the general manager at the Golden Nugget hotel and casino in Biloxi. ""No one has tried to leave, thank goodness, because everything is flooded around us,"" he told a local CBS TV station. States of emergency were declared in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as 29 Florida counties, ahead of the storm. Residents in areas outside New Orleans' levee system were evacuated and the city was placed under a curfew from 7pm. But the city has avoided the worst of the winds and storm surge as Nate passed east. New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted the curfew around an hour after it started, once it became clear the storm would not cause major problems for the city. The storm passed by Mexico's Yucatan peninsula - home to beach resorts incuding Cancun and Playa del Carmen - as it headed north. Around three quarters of US Gulf of Mexico oil production was turned offline ahead of the hurricane's arrival. At least 12 people were killed by the storm in Nicaragua, nine in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador."

An estimated 500 million round pounds are still in circulation, and some supermarket trolleys and rail ticket machines may not be ready in time for the switch. FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""Small businesses have embraced the new pound coin as an invaluable way to reduce counterfeits. ""Many have modified coin-operated equipment while others have separated out millions of old coins to be melted down. ""But the changeover period has been fairly short. While no business is obliged to accept the old coins beyond the deadline, it would help if small firms knew they were allowed a short transition period to collect the old coins if they wish to and are willing to bank them - but not give out to customers. ""This would provide a useful community service, allowing customers a few weeks to get rid of the final few pound coins in circulation."" :: Everything you needs to know about new £1 Some retailers have said they will do just that - with Poundland confirming more than 850 of its stores will continue accepting old coins until 31 October. Banks and post offices will also accept deposits containing old £1 coins until further notice. The round pound has been heavily counterfeited since its launch in 1983, and its replacement was introduced for the first time in March. On Monday, the Treasury was adamant that consumers should getting swapping or spending their old coins now. Chief executive and deputy master of the Royal Mint, Adam Lawrence, said: ""The round pound has been in circulation for over 30 years but, as the deadline approaches, we are keen to encourage everyone to track down their final coins and use them."""
2017-10-09,The Prime Minster has decided to go for it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-accelerates-into-brexit-tidal-wave-11074461,"A little like a captain of a ship facing a tidal wave, and realising the only way through is to accelerate into it. As expected, that meant the publication of outline plans for what No Deal would mean to our customs and trade system. This matters to Brexiteer ultras, but the more telling matter was that no money has been set aside, no land bought, no customs officers employed. It is a paper trade designed, by talking about No Deal, to avoid it ever happening. The Government did not sign up to the views of its former or current Cabinet ministers that No Deal would be perfectly fine. Instead, the PM did something really quite unexpected. She told Jacob Rees-Mogg, to his face, on the floor of the Commons that, yes, the European Court of Justice would be maintaining its jurisdiction during the transition phase. Officially, that is, until an alternative dispute resolution mechanism (an EFTA-type court for UK-EU) can be negotiated. In practice this will take at least two years. This may well have been the obvious implication of Mrs May's Florence speech, but it was not clearly stated, and the PM did not, for example, choose to clarify the same point in her Sky News interview last week. On Monday she did, choosing to dispense with the fudge, clear the fog, and try to get down to actual business. Mr Rees-Mogg was ""concerned"" and told Sky News that the PM had gone ""further than I wished her to go on ECJ jurisdiction during transition"". Bill Cash said MPs were keen to study the detail. Other Brexiteers said they were ""relaxed"" and could stomach the ECJ for another ""two years"". But this clearly crossed the private red lines of some Cabinet ministers, and the public ones expressed just before the Tory conference by Boris Johnson. No matter, the Foreign Secretary was soon to be found agreeing with the PM entirely on transition and agreeing with Michael Gove that the focus should be on the end state. Indeed Number 10 advisers say they have managed to convince all but a handful of MPs that she needs to focus all her ""negotiating capital not on a transition but on the end state"". It has, for now, worked. The PM has carried her Cabinet towards a position supporting a multi-year transition with full payments and ECJ jurisdiction. It may yet provide a few queasy moments in the Commons. The real question: will it unlock progress with the European Union? Perhaps it will create some goodwill that reaches ""sufficient progress"" by December. The question: whether her backbenchers will stomach more compromises on their pure ""clean Brexit"". So far it seems the PM calculates, as I argued last month, that her backbenchers will cash in their chips, and not risk their Brexit for No Brexit or a Corbyn Brexit. We want to save our negotiating capital for the end state."
2017-10-09,"BAE Systems, Britain's biggest defence contractor, is to axe more than 1,000 jobs this week in a bitter blow for Britain's manufacturing industry.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/bae-systems-to-axe-over-1000-uk-jobs-amid-typhoon-slowdown-11073489,"Sky News has learnt that BAE will announce that many of the job cuts will affect its Warton plant in Preston, Lancashire, with the company's new chief executive, Charles Woodburn, also ""trimming"" its workforce at other locations. Insiders said the number of jobs being axed would number ""well over 1,000"", although the precise figure was unclear on Monday. BAE employs 34,600 people in the UK, nearly half of its 83,000-strong global workforce. The move is certain to ignite a furious political row because of the timing of the cuts, with heightened sensitivity over workforce reductions at major exporters amid uncertainty over the terms of Brexit. Sources said that Brexit was ""not a factor"" in the BAE decision. The issue is nevertheless likely to be raised at a meeting that Theresa May is holding with business leaders - including the bosses of manufacturers and industrial groups such as Balfour Beatty, GlaxoSmithKline and JCB - later on Monday. The Warton job cuts are understood to relate largely to a continued slowdown in production of the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter aircraft, with ongoing uncertainty about the timing of a potentially large order from Saudi Arabia. BAE announced last month that it had secured an order for 24 of the combat aircraft from Qatar, a deal hailed by the Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon as ""an important moment in our defence relationship and the basis for even closer defence co-operation between our two countries"". The latest round of redundancies are expected to be made public on Tuesday - although a source suggested that they could be brought forward to later on Monday as a result of their early disclosure. The news will come just three months after Mr Woodburn replaced Ian King as BAE's chief executive, and will reflect some of his initial thinking about the cost base of one of Britain's most important manufacturers, according to insiders. ""We obviously have to review our (Typhoon) production demand very carefully,"" Mr Woodburn said in August. ""We are confident that we will win further Typhoon orders, what we can't be confident around is the timing."" One defence industry source said it was conceivable that more than two-thirds of Warton's workforce could be at risk from future rounds of cuts. The company said: ""BAE Systems continually reviews its operations to make sure we are performing as effectively and efficiently as possible, delivering our commitments to existing customers and ensuring we are best placed to secure future business. ""If and when there are any changes proposed we are committed to communicating with our employees and their representatives first."""

Police said the 29-year-old visited woods near his Birmingham home in preparation for a possible attack, including reconnaissance of the main London rail line. CCTV showed him climbing down a storm drain near a high-speed track - but detectives said they could find no evidence of a specific target or train service. Hussain, a former doorman, used a bedroom at his parents' house as his ""base of operations and improvised laboratory"". He successfully made four igniters from fairy lights and tried to make a remote-control detonator from a wireless doorbell. A book that included talk of attacking rail lines was also found at his home after his arrest in August 2015. Judge Mr Justice Sweeney, sentencing Hussain to a minimum of 15 years at Winchester Crown Court, said it was clear he was ""strongly committed"" to carrying out multiple bombings. His device was not viable, but if it had been, the judge said it would have caused a ""significant explosion"" and been potentially fatal. Hussain claimed after his arrest that he was just experimenting with explosives and intended to sell the device to The Sun newspaper. But jurors heard how he had a strong interest in IS and had viewed hundreds of images connected to the terror group, as well as the Boston marathon bombers - who also used pressure-cooker bombs. The judge said the jail term took into account expert reports that Hussain suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, and did so at the time of the offence. However, he added that he ""had some doubts as to the genuineness of your mental illness"". Jailing Hussain, the judge added: ""You are a dangerous offender and in the view of the level of the danger that you pose, and the impossibility of predicting when it will come to an end, this is an appropriate case in which to impose a sentence of life imprisonment."""

Mr Grayling said 80,000 people had now been brought back to the UK in the operation, which has been organised by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The airline's collapse also saw 750,000 who had yet to travel lose their bookings. Mr Grayling told the Commons that the Government would examine any necessary reforms to ensure passengers ""do not find themselves in this position again"". He added: ""We need to look at all the options… whether it's possible for airlines to be able to wind down in an orderly manner and look after their customers themselves without the need for the Government to step in. ""We'll be putting a lot of effort into this in the months ahead."" :: Aircraft firm rescued after Monarch collapse Mr Grayling said the Government was in talks with credit and debit card firms and travel booking companies about recovering some of the costs to taxpayers of the Monarch operation. Part of the expense was also covered by the industry's Atol scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Grayling said that Job Centre Plus had identified 6,300 vacancies at UK-based airlines after 2,000 people lost their jobs as a result of Monarch's collapse. He added that the collapse of the airline was ""not an issue around Brexit"" - telling MPs the business had been struggling for three years and was squeezed by an industry price war. However the SNP's Patricia Gibson said there was ""no denying that the fall in the pound has led to a significant increase in operating costs for this airline over the past year"" while the weakness of sterling had also affected consumers and led to a drop in bookings. Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald blamed Monarch's collapse on a ""litany of failures"" by Government, the regulator and the company's financial backers and advisers. He added that the aviation industry was also caught up in the ""foggy skies of Brexit"" with a lack of certainty after March 2019."

He wrote: ""All I am asking is let me take a leave of absence and get into heavy therapy and counselling...allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance. ""A lot of the allegations are false as you know but given therapy and counselling as other people have done, I think I'd be able to get there. ""I could really use your support or just your honesty if you can support me...I am desperate for your help...do not let me be fired."" The film producer was fired from the company he co-founded, The Weinstein Company, following allegations he sexually harassed women over several decades. Earlier, Meryl Streep was among those who slammed his behaviour, describing it as ""inexcusable"". Streep has said she did not know about claims of sexual harassment made the film producer but added: ""The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported,"" Streep said in a statement. ""The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes."" Streep worked with Weinstein on films including August: Osage County and The Iron Lady and once called him ""God"" during an acceptance speech. Her statement comes after allegations made against him by several women were published in The New York Times last week. Streep says that many people in Hollywood did not know about his alleged behaviour until then. ""One thing can be clarified,"" she said. ""Not everybody knew. ""Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally."" Streep said she did not know about any alleged offences. ""If everybody knew, I don't believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it,"" she said. The Academy Award-winning actress also called on the media to do more to uncover similar situations. ""The behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,"" she said. ""Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game."" Following the accusations, Weinstein apologised for his conduct, saying: ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it."" He has also criticised the New York Times and suggested that he would sue the newspaper over their decision to publish the article. Weinstein, 65, has not been charged with any crimes."
2017-10-09,A Prime Minister considered on the brink.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-a-prime-minister-on-life-support-11073285,"Talk of a leadership election abounds and the party conference season descends. Party consigliere whisper that it's a ""make or break"" week for the Prime Minister and all eyes are on the all-important leader's speech. That's right. It's 1969 and Harold Wilson is leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister. He addresses the leadership questions: ""I know what is going on"" he says, impishly surveying the room. ""I am going on."" Almost instantly his leadership was saved, by a single quip. But then, he got his words out. It should never have even mattered. Had Theresa May won a majority of 100, if the Brexit negotiations were going well, if the vultures weren't circling, this week, as excruciating as it was, Theresa May's cough and set malfunction would not have been a problem. But it was a torrid week at the end of an even more torrid six months, leaving every pundit, politician and pollster in Westminster wondering: how long can she last? She has two strong cards left in her much-depleted deck. The first is that most Tory MPs feel that it would not only appear ridiculous but be actively damaging to the Brexit process to dispatch a Prime Minister before at least a significant portion of the negotiations are complete. Interestingly though, this week has changed something. It has added the ""significant portion"" bit of that sentence. Before this week, most Tory MPs thought that it would be most sensible for the PM to stay until 2019, when Britain leaves the EU and the negotiations are complete. I've detected a significant change in tone over the weekend. Lots of Conservative MPs are talking about her now only completing part of it, perhaps securing a transition deal (as she outlined in her Florence speech) and then leaving the second part (negotiating an ongoing trade relationship) to someone else. Secondly, the PM still has the power to hire and fire. It wasn't only May who failed to impress at party conference. The feeling amongst activists was that much of the Cabinet appeared tired and jaded, with few if any sparkling performances. There's a great appetite to rejuvenate the Conservative brand through fresh ideas and new faces. Many MPs would like May to fulfil a near caretaker role, ditching the deadwood and bringing forward 2015 and 2017 MPs into the top ranks of government. It suits those MPs (and they are now a very significant portion of the parliamentary party) for May to stay on for a while. If she went now, one of the old praetorian guard would have to take over - a Johnson, a Davis, a Hammond. Far better to keep May in place, get cabinet experience and then go for the top job in a year or so: young cardinals like old popes. But however much those 'young Turks' might like May to hang around, it may soon be out of her hands. She may have (just) survived the conference season but doing so came at a cost: her last life. She is one move - a scandal, a crisis bungled, a situation misjudged - away from being politically dead. And the political landscape is riddled with landmines. There's Brexit and the eight related bills making their way through parliament, all of which are subject to nefarious amendments from trouble-making MPs on the opposition and government benches (not to mention the Lords). There's the upcoming energy bill: a signature domestic initiative with which many free-marketeer Tory MPs are uncomfortable because it imposes a statist energy cap on a privatised industry and worse, looks suspiciously like an Ed Miliband idea. Any significant rebellion on the Conservative side could wound the Prime Minister beyond repair. And the reshuffle could disastrously backfire. For every loyalty bought with a 50 pieces of silver in the form of a place around the Cabinet table, there is a cost. A dispatched and sullen minister is free to roam on the backbenches and to cause trouble, none more so than Johnson. In allowing speculation to build up over the weekend that she might move him, May is in an invidious position. Move him and create a blonde-mopped king over the water. Don't move him and be a pusillanimous pansy and prove once again, just how feeble she's become. Any of these would try a strong Prime Minister with a solid majority. She could anticipate them arising and that's exactly why she called an election to try and get one. A Prime Minister on life support could be brought down by any one of them. Maybe the Prime Minister could do worse to look back to old Harold Wilson for inspiration. He led a minority government. He had huge egos to manage in his Cabinet. And he was perhaps the only Prime Minister in our history who, leading a divided party, successfully managed to navigate the issue of Europe. On the other side of the ledger, three Tory prime ministers in a row have been brought down over the subject. May is a hair's breadth away from being the fourth."

And she said Theresa May's Government's policy was no clearer now and the UK could crash out of the EU with no deal. Interviewed on day two of the SNP conference in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said a second EU referendum was not her party's policy. But she said: ""I think that argument may well gather real force and become hard to resist in the future. ""When people voted in the Brexit referendum - and this makes it very different from the independence referendum in Scotland - there was no detail about what people were voting for. ""The most detail people had was that lie across the side of a bus and 15 months on we still don't have any detail. ""We could end up crashing out with no deal, with a bad deal. And in those circumstances, for a government simply to say to people they have to accept the outcome no matter how bad it is may become very difficult for them to sustain."" The SNP leader also paid tribute to Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign, declaring: ""Sky has been leading the way on this issue. ""Increasingly people are very concerned about waste on our streets, on our beaches and in our seas. So we've decided we're going to introduce a deposit return scheme for bottles. ""Having made that commitment and given a clear decision to go forward, we're now in the phase of designing how that scheme will work in practice."" The First Minister said she welcomed an indication from the UK government that it might look at a similar scheme to Scotland's as well. ""So hopefully we'll see real action here to clean up our seas and beaches and streets, take action as part of the wider action we have to take to protect the planet and the environment for the next generation."" She also offered some comfort to Scotland's football manager Gordon Strachan after his team crashed out of the World Cup qualifiers and he claimed his team struggled because Scots are not as tall as players from other nations. ""I'm a huge fan of Gordon Strachan,"" she said. ""I remember when I was much younger - a wee girl, in fact - watching him play for Scotland. I always really liked Gordon. ""Anyone who takes on the job of Scotland manager is taking on a lot of responsibility and pressure on to their shoulders and I think we should be grateful to Gordon for doing that. ""I suspect his comments were probably made in the heat of the moment. I'm not sure the argument can be taken too far. ""We got better over this qualification campaign. We almost got into the play-offs. I think we've come closer to qualifying than we have in a few years. Let's take the positive from that. ""But clearly we've still got work to do. We're not quite good enough yet, but hopefully we'll see Scotland in a major championship in the not too distant future."""

Speaking as the CQC's annual review for 2016-17 found that the NHS is under pressure from rising demand while facing staff shortages and a reduction in hospital and nursing home beds, Sir David called on the Government to develop a sustainable plan for social care and provide the funding to implement it. ""Our report will be laid before Parliament and it is for Parliament to debate how they respond,"" he said. ""The future funding of adult social care, I think, is one of the unresolved policy issues. We have a system that is designed in the middle of the 20th Century which is struggling to accommodate the needs of the 21st century. We need a solution. ""Adult social care requires more funding and in relation to the NHS we need new ways of working and that change needs to be supported by finances."" Local authority spending on social care has been under pressure because of funding cuts over the last seven years. The Government is planning to issue a consultation on social care by the end of the year but there are reports a Green Paper will not be published until next summer. Sir David also warned that the NHS is ""struggling to cope with 21st century problems"", with a system designed in the 20th century now having to cope with soaring levels of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and, most pressing of all, a rise in the number of elderly patients with complex multiple conditions. After conducting 29,000 inspections the CQC concluded that the majority of services are good or outstanding, but highlighted concerns over safety. The CQC rated 55% of NHS acute services as ""good"", but found that 67% of acute Trusts required improvement when it came to patient safety. It also found 66% of NHS urgent and emergency services were not safe enough, with 60% ""requiring improvement"" and 7% ""inadequate"". Some 78% of adult social care services were rated ""good"", Sir David warned that the system is in urgent need of a ""long-term sustainable solution"" from the government. The report also highlighted a 16% increase in the number of staff vacancies across health and social care, and bed occupancy running at 91%, above the ""safe"" level of 85%, and a fall in the number of GPs per 100,000 people, down to 62 from 67 in three years. Sir David said social care was under pressure from a 2% fall in the number of nursing home beds; an increase in the number of people with ""unmet need"" to 1.2m; and evidence that care companies are handing back contracts to local authorities because they are uneconomic. ""From 2014 to 2034 we are going to see an increase in people aged over 85 from 1.5 million to 3.2 million people,"" he said. ""We are living longer but are not living healthier so I think what we are signalling is that the system now and into the future has got to deal with those increased numbers of older people who are going to have more than one condition. ""We are going to see a fall in the quality of services that are offered to people and that may mean that the safety of some people is compromised."""
2017-10-09,"Brexit should be the catalyst for Britain to put a greater focus on its small businesses, according to the UK boss of eBay. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/ebay-boss-says-brexits-an-opportunity-for-uk-firms-11074138,"In an exclusive interview for Sky News, Rob Hattrell said that Brexit was ""an opportunity"" for the companies who used eBay's trading platform. ""That opportunity comes mainly in export so we have seen a growth of export products from the UK from the moment Brexit was announced,"" he said. Mr Hattrell, who took over running eBay UK earlier this year, claimed that response was not simply to do with currency movements, but also because of the ""strong entrepreneurial streak"" of British small businesses, creating products ""that are loved and looked for all over the world"". ""These businesses are very agile,"" he said. ""They are able to redevelop and reconfigure, and respond to macroeconomic challenges at enormous speed. ""That is crucial to being able to survive when you have a customer population that is changing how it shops on a constant basis."" Mr Hattrell joined eBay from Tesco, where he had overseen the grocery giant's general merchandise business. He had previously been Tesco's IT director, giving him experience across both retail and technology - a combination that attracted eBay's headhunters. His challenge is to continue to grow eBay's market, while also ensuring there is clear space between it and Amazon. Industry sources say Mr Hattrell intends to add ""more warmth"" to the eBay brand in the coming year, while also dealing with the ramifications of Brexit. ""We haven't got clarity about Brexit yet but change is inevitable and it is just another change that is happening in the market,"" he told me. ""Ebay has been around for 22 years and in those 22 years shopping has changed fundamentally - in terms of growth of mobile, how people shop and interact. ""Brexit is just another change on top of that. You just have to focus on customers."" Around 80% of deals on the company's website are now being offered by businesses, selling to consumers. The other 20% are consumers selling to each other - an area that, he believes, may grow if there is ""economic pressure on household income because then one of the ways people can relieve that is by selling things using our platform"". Ebay is a global trading platform that supported $84bn of deals in 2016. The UK business does not break down how much of that is done in this country, but Britain is the world's third biggest market for e-commerce behind the United States and China. In common with other American corporate giants, the company has attracted criticism for the low level of tax it has paid in this country. Its last set of financial results shows the UK company paying tax of £1.6m, despite turning over more than £200m. ""We pay all our tax in all jurisdictions,"" Mr Hattrell said. ""You have to look at broader contributions we make - at the people we employ and the businesses we employ."" He also said he rejected claims that eBay was not doing enough to deter VAT fraud, saying: ""We work closely with HMRC - we share data and if we are notified of sellers who are not paying VAT then we will shut them down. ""We don't want them on the platform."" Mr Hattrell's view of the future is one of increasing speed, technology, ease and security - of nimble small businesses increasingly outwitting existing retail giants. And he thinks we may have already had a clue as to how that future will work - thanks to fidget spinners. In September 2016, there were 650 searches on eBay for fidget spinners over the course of the whole month. Six months later, there were 650 such searches every two seconds. The speed with which fidget spinners turned from obscurity to global craze was a lesson in modern sales. ""The gap between invention and the market is shorter and shorter,"" he said. ""Consumers are moving faster all the time, they engage on mobile phones, their time is precious and attention spans are shorter."""
2017-10-09,A team of scientists is planning an expedition to explore the hidden marine life which has been exposed by a trillion-ton iceberg breaking off the West Antarctic ice shelf.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/mysterious-marine-life-lies-beneath-breakaway-larsen-c-iceberg-in-antarctica-11073746,"The 2,200 square mile section of the Larsen C ice shelf - almost four times the size of London - snapped off in mid-July, reducing the size of the shelf by 12% and changing the landscape of the peninsula forever. The release of the new iceberg - called calving - means researchers can now for the first time investigate the ""mysterious marine ecosystem"" that has been hidden beneath it for up to 120,000 years. Marine biologist Katrin Linse, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), is leading the mission. She said: ""We have a unique opportunity to study how marine life responds to a dramatic environmental change. ""Normally, it takes years to plan the logistics for marine research cruises. Our funder, NERC (Natural Environment Research Council), and our ship operations team recognise the urgency to act quickly. ""Everyone is pulling out the stops to make this happen. ""All we need now is for the iceberg to move far enough away from the remaining shelf and the sea ice to melt so that we can navigate safely."" Dr Linse said it was ""exciting to think about what we might find"". The study will take place in February 2018 on board the BAS' research ship, the RRS James Clark Ross, and is expected to last around three weeks. Phil Trathan, head of conservation biology at BAS, who is part of the expedition team, said the calving offered ""a new and unprecedented opportunity"" for research. While cracks happen periodically - and this one is believed to have been a natural event - experts are also watching to see whether the process has been affected or accelerated by global warming. As the iceberg was floating before it snapped, it is thought the break will have no immediate impact on sea level. Larsen C is 350 metres thick and is the largest and most northerly of the Antarctic ice shelves."

In her speech ending the three-day conference in Glasgow, the SNP leader will announce new policies on housing, the economy, energy, young people and families battling to cope with the cost of living. While she will re-affirm her party's commitment to a second referendum on Scottish independence and opposition to Brexit, Ms Sturgeon will take on critics who claim she has neglected domestic issues. She will say: ""A country which values education and cares for future generations will always be in the driving seat. ""At the heart of all that we do is a determination to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up. ""Right now, we deliver around 16 hours of early education and childcare a week - generally, that's either a morning or an afternoon session each day. ""It means some parents still face a struggle to find and fund the childcare they need to allow them to work. ""We are going to change that. ""By 2020, we will deliver around 30 hours a week for every three and four year old and eligible two year old. ""It will give children the best start in life. And working parents will save around £350 a month on the costs of childcare. ""Often when I have talked about this policy, I've been asked - sometimes sceptically - if we will really be able to fund it properly. ""Well, today, we put our money where our mouth is. ""Over the past few months, we have undertaken detailed work to assess the investment needed. ""Right now, we invest around £420m a year in early years education and childcare. ""I can announce today that by the end of this Parliament, that will rise to £840m a year."" In her speech, the First Minister is also expected to reaffirm that she cannot spell out a timetable for a second referendum on Scottish independence until the uncertainties over Brexit are resolved. She will also defend the SNP's record in government in Scotland over the past decade, rejecting criticism that the party has a poor record on health, education and the Scottish economy."

In a WhatsApp message to Conservative MPs, he wrote: ""I am frankly fed up to the back teeth with all this. ""I do not know who these people are. I do not know if they are really my friends and allies or if they represent some sinister band of imposters. ""I heartily disagree with the sense, tone and spirit of what they are quoted as saying. ""Whoever they are they do not speak for me."" :: Boris Johnson urges Tories on WhatsApp: 'Get behind PM' Mr Johnson's message comes as Mrs May prepares to brief Parliament over the status of Brexit negotiations and as talks resume in Brussels. The Prime Minister has come under pressure to sack both Mr Johnson and Mr Hammond as she tries to reassert her authority over the Tory party. Mrs May vowed she would not ""hide from a challenge"" amid speculation she could reshuffle her Cabinet to shore up her precarious position. On Monday, The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Johnson would resist any attempt to demote him, forcing Mrs May to either leave him in post or sack him. Mr Johnson has been accused of undermining the PM by putting forward his own vision for Brexit. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said on Monday that Mrs May has full confidence in Mr Hammond and Mr Johnson. He said: ""I never discuss whether reshuffles are or are not taking place. But as the Prime Minister said yesterday in the Sunday Times, she has a fantastic Cabinet."" :: Analysis: A Prime Minister on life support Mrs May has also faced repeated questions on whether Mr Johnson is ""unsackable"" after she lost her Commons majority in the general election. Last week, Mr Johnson called on Conservative colleagues to move on from ""malarkey"" surrounding Mrs May's position and to ""get behind the PM"" following her difficult party conference speech. He wrote: ""Get behind the PM. Ordinary punters I have spoken to thought her speech was good and anyone can have a cold."" It comes after it emerged that Welwyn Hatfield MP Grant Shapps claimed to have the backing of around 30 MPs, including ""one or two"" Cabinet ministers, calling for Mrs May to resign."
2017-10-09,"The police officers who stormed the hotel room of Las Vegas killer Stephen Paddock have revealed details of the ""deadly game of hide-and-seek"" that led them to the gunman's lair.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/las-vegas-team-that-stormed-paddocks-room-reveal-deadly-game-of-hide-and-seek-11073598,"Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds of others as he opened fire from his room in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on a concert below. In their first TV interview since the 1 October massacre, the officers told of how they managed to get to the gunman as the bullets rained down on 22,000 country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip. They arrived on the 32nd floor of the luxury hotel to discover Paddock had barricaded shut a stairwell door, going up to the hallway, right by his room, to try and stop police and hotel security during his rampage. ""He had screwed shut the door with a piece of metal and some screws,"" Sergeant Joseph Bitsko told CBS show 60 Minutes. One of the team had a pry bar and was able to prise open the door. Police radio calls to the team told them to watch out for booby traps, as they came across a room service cart with wires on it going underneath the door of the gunman's room. ""Initially, I was thinking, 'This is a booby trap, it's going to explode'. It turned out to be cameras,"" said Sgt Bitsko. The door was riddled with bullet holes. ""It looked like Swiss cheese,"" said officer David Newton. ""He knew we were coming and we were going to have to come through. We didn't know where he was going to be in that room."" Sgt Bitsko added: ""It was like a deadly game of hide-and-seek."" When the gunfire stopped, officer Newton stood behind the door with only a single police shield for protection, while a SWAT officer, Levi Hancock, prepared to blow open the door with explosives. They entered to find the shooter's arsenal of firearms and ammunition ""neatly stacked in suitcases"" with shell-casings and rifles littered across the floor ""It looked like almost a gun store,"" said officer Newton. ""We were tripping over guns, there were so many,"" added Sgt Bitsko.. Detective Matthew Donaldson found Paddock's body on the floor, with blood pouring out of his mouth and a revolver near him. Police said Paddock had killed himself. A motive for the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history has yet to be established. The team said the 64-year-old killer looked like an ""average Joe"" and told of their surprise to discover he was an ""older gentleman"". ""When we are trained on active shooter situations, we look for a younger male, dressed in military-type garb, that's moving through a crowd,"" said Sgt Bitsko. They also discovered several phones, laptops and tools in the ""eerie"" room. ""It looked straight up like out of a movie,"" said officer Newton. They also noticed a note near to his shooting platform with calculations of where to aim to maximise casualties. ""He did his homework,"" said officer Newton. ""His plan might have been to shoot it out with us because there was a rifle on a bipod near the door, and just the amount of ammunition and weapons he had, he could have held us off for hours."" Las Vegas police Sheriff Joe Lombardo praised the team that stormed the room, saying ""they prevented 1,000 deaths."" The killing has rekindled a gun control debate in America, especially on rapid-fire modification devices used in the attack. Paddock used ""bump stocks"" to transform many of his semi-automatic rifles into fully automated guns, meaning they were capable of firing much more quickly. The National Rifle Association, which has opposed efforts to pass federal gun legislation following previous mass shootings, said it would not oppose moves to regulate bump stocks. The revelations came as the Las Vegas Strip's bright lights dimmed for about 10 minutes to mark the passing of a week since the shooting. Investigators also returned to Paddock's home in Mesquite, in southern Nevada, to carry out a fresh search of the three-bedroom property, while the gunman's brother, Eric Paddock, was questioned for a second time, with detectives still grappling to find a motive for the shooting. Singer Jason Aldean, who was on stage when the shooting broke out, visited victims still being treated for their injuries at the University Medical Center in Nevada. ""His visit helped heal hearts and cheer those who were wounded in this tragedy. #vegasstrong,"" the hospital wrote on its Facebook page."

Brian Altman QC, lead counsel, said that inquiries had established a file from Lancashire Police and limited reports in the media at the time were passed on to the then prime minister's office. It demonstrated, Mr Altman said, that the matters had ""been considered at the very highest level of politics"". Despite the warnings, the knighthood was awarded after it was concluded that ""neither his history or character rendered Cyril Smith unable to be honoured"". Smith was the Liberal MP for Rochdale between 1972 and 1992. Allegations of child abuse surfaced during his lifetime but he was never prosecuted. He died in 2010. In 2012, Greater Manchester Police admitted there was overwhelming evidence that Smith had abused young children and that he should have been held to account. The IICSA hearings are currently examining failures within the care system in Rochdale. Multiple allegations of abuse were made against the MP and others relating to Cambridge House Boys' Hostel and Knowl View School, where Smith was a governor."

The Anti-Mask Act, prohibiting full-face coverings including headwear worn by some Muslims, came into force on 1 October. The law states faces must be visible from the hairline to the chin in public places. Off-piste ski masks, surgical masks outside of hospitals and party masks are included. But the law, which is popularly known as the ""burka ban"", is mostly seen as aimed at the conservative Islamic clothing. Those who break the law can be fined €150 and police are allowed to use force to make people show their faces. The man arrested was apparently dancing outside the store at the time police arrived, according to Heute newspaper. He is understood to have refused several requests to take off his shark's head. Heute said he told police he was only doing his job. The managing director of the advertising agency responsible for the campaign, Eugen Prosquill, told the newspaper he was not aware the new law applied to mascots. ""It would be a pity if there were no mascots left,"" he said. Austria's ""burka ban"" came after similar restrictions were brought in across France and Belgium and partial bans introduced in the Netherlands, Italy and Spain."

Among the findings were that Chinese children perform best at junior school, with 71% meeting the standard for reading, writing and maths. Only 54% of white British youngsters and 13% of white gypsy and Roma children meet the same target. But those from poorer backgrounds suffered most, with just under a third (32%) of white British children on free school meals reaching the expected standard. The divides reportedly only increase at secondary school, where white 15-year-olds are four times more likely to smoke than their non-white peers, the survey found. In employment, the rate of white people in work is higher than that of ethnic minorities - with a larger gap in the North (13.6%) than the South (9%). And those from non-white backgrounds are also under-represented at senior levels in public sector jobs. The revelations are just a small snapshot of data to be released by the Government on its new Ethnicity Facts and Figures website on Tuesday. The website was commissioned by Theresa May when she became Prime Minister, and will be launched to challenge society to ""explain or change"" the racial inequalities it unearths. Mrs May is expected to declare there is ""nowhere to hide"" for the Government or public services who do not act on its information. She will say ""these issues are now out in the open"" and that the collection of data provides ""definitive evidence"" of the challenges the UK still faces to ""build a country that works for everyone"". It includes never-before-published statistics as well as new analysis using previously available data. Simon Woolley, director of campaign organisation Operation Black Vote, said the findings were a ""real opportunity to make transformative change in tackling persistent race inequality"". He said some statistics made ""uncomfortable reading"", but that ""unless these things are laid bare we can't begin to resolve them"". And Mr Woolley praised the Prime Minister for showing ""a real desire to grapple with the scourge of racism"" - highlighting her challenging of high levels of ethnic minorities subjected to police stop and searches and non-white deaths in police custody."

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was dismissive about the Prime Minister's latest update, telling MPs that ""no real progress"" had been made, 16 months on from the Brexit vote. Despite an EU official earlier saying further compromise was needed from the UK to move the talks onto the next phase, the future trading relationship, Mrs May insisted it was up to Brussels to show ""flexibility"". In a statement in the Commons, she said: ""A new deep and special partnership between a sovereign United Kingdom and a strong and successful European Union is our ambition and our offer to our European friends. ""Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU. ""And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court, but I'm optimistic it will receive a positive response, because what we are seeking is not just the best possible deal for us, but I believe that will also be the best possible deal for our friends, too."" Backbench Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent Brexit supporter, said the Prime Minister had gone ""as far as she could reasonably go"" in what she had offered to the EU. ""If they reject it, then it would indicate a stubbornness, an obduracy, on their part which would indicate that they probably don't want a deal,"" he told Sky News. Turning to the latest Brexit papers, Mrs May said they ""pave the way for legislation to allow the UK to operate as an independent trading nation and to create an innovative customs system that will help us achieve the greatest possible tariff and barrier-free trade as we leave the EU"". She added: ""While I believe it is profoundly in all our interests for the negotiations to succeed, it is also our responsibility as a Government to prepare for every eventuality, so that is exactly what we are doing. ""These white papers also support that work, including setting out steps to minimise disruption for businesses and travellers."" The trade paper confirmed the UK will not be able to bring into effect any free trade agreements with other nations during the two-year transition period being sought by the Prime Minister. The Government will instead ""pursue"" trade talks during this phase. Existing EU trade deals and preferential arrangements with other countries will be ""transitioned"" into domestic law through legislation post-Brexit. This is to maintain ""the greatest amount of certainty, continuity and stability in our trade and investment relationships for our businesses, citizens and trading partners,"" according to the white paper. International Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox said: ""This paper is the first exciting step and sets out the principles behind an approach which will help British businesses to make the most of trade opportunities, contribute to a growing economy and create prosperity for communities up and down the UK."" The customs bill will create a new ""stand alone"" customs regime post-Brexit, regardless of whether any deal is agreed with the EU. VAT and excise duty regimes will be amended so that they continue to function effectively once the UK has severed ties with Brussels."

In a further blow to customers just over a week later, an additional 18,000 flights for the winter season were scrapped. The latest update on the fiasco said all 315,000 customers in the first tranche of cancellations had been emailed, with 311,000 re-routings or refunds ""processed"".

It emerged over the weekend that Ryanair's chief operations officer Michael Hickey was to leave the airline after nearly 30 years, in the wake of the fiasco. The airline was fiercely criticised on the wake of the cancellations by Andrew Haines, head of the Civil Aviatiom Authority (CAA). He said he was ""furious"" with the carrier, which he said appeared to show ""disregard for consumers and the law"". The CAA said Ryanair had not told customers about European rules which entitled them to be re-routed by another carrier.

The 38-year-old was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 as she was about to fly home with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella after a family visit. The country's Revolutionary Guard claimed she was plotting to overthrow the regime, an allegation Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe denies. They tried to get her to confess that she trained and recruited spies, her family said. The latest charges claim the Thomson Reuters Foundation worker joined organisations working to topple the Iranian system, and that she once protested outside the London embassy. Husband Richard Ratcliffe said the Revolutionary Guard was ""inventing new charges to prevent her early release"". Mr Radcliffe said his wife had not been given access to a lawyer, while Iran also does not recognise her right to British consular assistance. ""It is not melodramatic to say what is happening to Nazanin is torture. Look at the impact on her. Justice must be done,"" he said. Speaking to Sky News in August, Mr Radcliffe said his wife was in a ""fragile state"" and had seen a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with advanced depression. According to the family's campaign, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said of the new charges: ""I have always been honest with them about what I have done and who I worked for. I was not trying to overthrow the regime. ""I love my country. It is ridiculous. I have not done anything since I was sentenced. I have just been a prisoner in the corner, enduring quietly. What have they done this for?"" She added: ""I am so tired. Recently I thought it was the beginning of the end. But now I am back to the beginning. My life is slipping away from my hands, and I can't do anything. I just want to come home."" The couple's north London MP Tulip Siddiq says the latest charges are an ""outrage"". She has called for Foreign Secreatry Boris Johnson to take a tougher line and formally request Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release. Mr Johnson broached the subject on the fringes of the UN General Assembly last month, and said progress in the UK-Iran relationship would depend to some extent on the resolution of the case. The Prime Minister has also raised the issue, according to a Foreign Office statement in April."
2017-10-09,Six armed robbers are believed to have escaped on a single moped after smashing their way into a jewellery shop in London's Regent Street.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/six-escape-on-one-moped-after-machete-smash-and-grab-at-regent-street-jewellers-11074435,"Some of them were equipped with a machete and a hammer, police said, which they used to smash cabinets during the raid at about 7.18pm on Monday. Officers said they made off with a ""high value of goods"" from Mappin & Webb. Police said one moped was abandoned at the scene and a second bike was involved in a collision in Oxford Street. The suspects who crashed were then picked up by a third moped - with all six reportedly fleeing on the same vehicle. There have been no arrests. Witnesses posted pictures on social media of the shop filled with smoke after the incident. ""Smash and grab at Regent Street jewellers. All three emergency services on scene, smoke deployed in the store,"" one person tweeted. The incident comes amid a surge in moped-enabled crime and motorcycle theft in the capital, with police often instructed not to pursue suspects for fear of the consequences if there is a crash."
2017-10-09,"A fitness instructor ""assaulted, abused and ultimately murdered"" his 18-month-old adopted daughter, a court has heard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/matthew-scully-hicks-dad-accused-of-murdering-adopted-daughter-11073924,"Matthew Scully-Hicks is accused of inflicting serious injuries on Elsie Scully-Hicks before she died in May 2016. The 31-year-old had formally adopted Elsie with his husband, Craig Scully-Hicks, just a fortnight earlier, Cardiff Crown Court heard. The part-time fitness instructor denies murdering the child at the couple's home in Cardiff. The court heard that at about 6.20pm on 25 May, Wales Ambulance Service received a 999 call from Scully-Hicks reporting that Elsie was unresponsive. Paul Lewis QC, prosecuting, told the jury that paramedics went to the house and found Elsie was not breathing, with no sign of a heartbeat. She received first aid from paramedics at the scene before being taken to the University Hospital of Wales, and died in the early hours of 29 May. Mr Lewis said: ""We allege that his (Scully-Hicks') actions on the late afternoon/evening of 25 May were the tragic culmination of a course of violent conduct on his part towards a defenceless child - an infant that he should have loved and protected, but whom he instead assaulted, abused and ultimately murdered."" Medical tests found Elsie had suffered bilateral subdural haemorrhages - bleeding on both sides of the brain. Evidence of both recent and older bleeding on the brain was also discovered, with haemorrhages also found in front of both of Elsie's eyes. A post-mortem revealed Elsie had also suffered several broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. The court heard she had been removed from her natural mother, a drug user, within days of being born in November 2014, and placed in the care of Vale of Glamorgan Council. She went to live with the couple in September 2015. It was agreed that Matthew Scully-Hicks would give up full-time work to care for any children, with his husband continuing his job as a company director. On 5 November 2015, Elsie suffered an injury to her right leg when Craig Scully-Hicks was at work. She was taken to the doctor four days later and a hospital x-ray revealed a fracture just above her right ankle. Mr Lewis told the court Matthew Scully-Hicks gave differing accounts of how his daughter suffered the injury to his husband and to doctors. On 16 December, Elsie sustained a bruise to the lefthand side of her forehead. A health visitor told Scully-Hicks to take her for treatment, and it is alleged he lied that he had done so. On January 18 2016, Elsie suffered another bruise to her head. Mr Scully-Hicks received a phone call from his husband on 10 March, saying that he was in an ambulance with Elsie as she had fallen down the stairs. Mr Lewis said Elsie's injuries were considered to be ""consistent with a fall downstairs"". At 6.18pm on 25 May, Scully-Hicks - who was alone with Elsie and her adoptive sibling - called the Welsh Ambulance Service, saying that Elsie was not awake or breathing. Scully-Hicks told the operator he was changing his daughter for bed when she ""went all floppy and limp"". During the call he could be heard saying ""oh my God"" and ""this is horrible"", the court heard. Scully-Hicks allegedly told paramedic Jonathan Aberg that Elsie had ""screamed out as in pain, then collapsed"". ""This was not something that the defendant was ever to tell Craig Scully-Hicks, hospital staff or the police,"" Mr Lewis said. At the hospital, Scully-Hicks told police, doctors and his husband that he had changed Elsie on the floor in front of the TV and had taken the dirty nappy out to the kitchen. When he came back he found her apparently sleeping, and when she did not respond to him he began CPR, he said. After Elsie's death, the x-ray of her right leg from November 2015 was re-examined. It was found that Elsie had in fact suffered two fractures, one near the ankle and one just above the knee. Mr Lewis told the court that Sarah Harrison, a consultant paediatric radiologist, believes the injuries are ""the result of trauma"". Nia John, a consultant paediatrician, said it would be ""unusual to suffer two such fractures in the same fall, the court heard. The case continues."

He later boasted about the attack, telling a witness: ""I can't believe I killed someone but I actually enjoyed it."" Prosecutor Elwen Evans QC told Swansea Crown Court that Wathan - who was drunk - had sneaked into the house in Morriston, Swansea, after finding the front door unlocked. When Mrs Morgan went to bed at about midnight on 12 March, she discovered Wathan asleep in her room. Her husband went upstairs with a small hammer and dragged Wathan downstairs into the dining room, where he pinned him to a sofa as he waited for police. Wathan, armed with a knife, seized the hammer and attacked him, before stabbing Mrs Morgan in the arm. Miss Evans said: ""While the injuries inflicted on Mr Morgan were really serious, he did not die. ""The injuries inflicted on Mrs Morgan appeared less serious. Tragically and as a direct consequence of that injury to the arm, rare and serious complications set in and led directly to Mrs Morgan's death."" Mrs Morgan contracted necrotising fasciitis, known as flesh-eating disease, from the knife wound and later died. The court heard Wathan did not steal anything from the house and may have been trying other doors. He told the couple: ""I am homeless and I only wanted a bed for the night."" Wathan, of Godre'r Graig, near Neath Port Talbot, was originally charged with Mrs Morgan's murder, but on the day of the trial admitted manslaughter. He also pleaded guilty to wounding Mr Morgan with intent to resist arrest, and possession of a knife. In a letter to the court, Wathan said: ""There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about it. I deserve to be punished. ""I feel so terrible, if I was not in that house Sheila Morgan would be here and Wayne Morgan would have his wife and her kids would have their mother."" Judge Sir Wyn Williams jailed Wathan for 13 years and passed an extended five-year period on licence. He said: ""There came a point you were armed with a hammer and a knife and in my judgment engaged in a sustained attack upon Mr Morgan. ""I accept it was a reckless act and that you didn't deliberately stab Mrs Morgan. It was, however, the start of a terrible chain of events. ""She died and you are totally responsible for her death by your reckless actions."""
2017-10-09,Boris Johnson has backed Theresa May's crunch speech on Brexit - despite her appearing to cross two of his previous 'red lines'.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171010031115/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-caves-in-over-brexit-red-lines-11074223,"The Foreign Secretary said the speech was a ""great statement"" and declared: ""What matters is the end state and our freedom to do things differently and better."" He hailed the Prime Minister's ""powerful vision"", which included warnings that a transitional period after the official EU divorce date could last longer than two years. Mrs May also suggested the European Court of Justice (ECJ) would overrule UK law beyond March 2019. The plans directly contravene two of the four so-called Brexit 'red lines' Mr Johnson revealed to The Sun just days before Tory conference. The newspaper claimed two of his vetoes were: ""The transition period post-Brexit must be a maximum of two years and not a second more"", and that ""the UK must refuse to accept new EU or ECJ rulings during transition"". In her first speech to MPs since a calamitous leader's speech in Manchester, Mrs May said the transitional period would be longer - ""around two years"". And she revealed the UK ""may"" remain governed by the ECJ even after the Article 50 deadline has struck. :: Johnson 'fed up' with media stories from 'allies':: EU bats Brexit ball back to 'optimistic' May Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake MP responded: ""Two of Boris Johnson's red lines have been scrubbed out, but he is still in the Government causing trouble. ""There is nothing to celebrate just because the Government is tearing itself apart - the Brexit process is still in chaos."" An Open Britain campaign spokesperson also told Sky News: ""Boris Johnson briefs the papers about his Brexit red lines, but it turns out he's just yellow. ""After weeks of stirring up Cabinet divisions, he caves in the minute conference season is over. ""The only person in this Government weaker than Boris is the Prime Minister, who seems unable to sack him despite his serial disloyalty."" But Mr Johnson was backed by environment secretary and arch-Brexiteer Michael Gove who tweeted: ""Boris is right."" Strong statement from PM on Brexit - let's be pragmatic over implementation  to secure maximum freedom to diverge from EU in end state Influential backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg also told Sky News the PM had gone ""as far as she could reasonably go"" in offering the EU a deal. ""If they reject it, then it would indicate a stubbornness, an obduracy, on their part which would indicate that they probably don't want a deal,"" he said. While veteran Brexit campaigner Sir Bill Cash added of Mrs May's speech: ""There are a lot of people who are looking very, very carefully at the words. ""The question of whether or not the ECJ would remain fully in control of its jurisdiction over the UK after 31 March 2019 and whether they would continue to make laws in relation to the period after that date is the big question. ""And that is exactly the one question that we have yet to clarify and make absolutely crystal clear what is being said."""
2017-10-10,Unilever is shifting scores of UK-based jobs to the Netherlands as part of a plan to create a new global headquarters for brands such as PG Tips and Magnum ice cream.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171011034614/http://news.sky.com/story/unilever-shifts-uk-food-jobs-to-rotterdam-in-pg-tips-merger-11075581,"Sky News has learnt that the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, which saw off a £115bn takeover bid from Kraft Heinz this year, has begun a consultation with approximately 140 of its UK workers about the relocation of their roles. The jobs being moved represent a small fraction of Unilever's ‎British workforce of more than 7,000, but the news will nevertheless attract interest because of the extent to which issues such as job security were raised during Kraft Heinz's brief interest in a deal. Sources close to the FTSE-100 company‎ pointed out that the combination of its food and refreshment units had been announced in April when it set out plans to improve profitability and returns to shareholders. While it had signalled its intention to base the newly merged unit in Rotterdam, however, Unilever h‎as not publicly disclosed plans to relocate more than 100 jobs from the UK. The decision is unrelated to Brexit, sources said, but is being driven by chief executive Paul Polman's desire to accelerate efforts to make Unilever's business more efficient. The headquarters of the company's home and personal care business, which includes Persil and Lynx, will remain in the UK. The food and refreshments merger, which will unite brands such as Marmite and Lipton tea under one management team, comes as Unilever runs a £6bn auction of its international spreads business. A number of private equity consortia plan to submit offers later this month. One pairing, of Bain Capital and Clayton Dubilier & Rice, has lined up Matthew Hill, a former Unilever executive, to work on its offer. Unilever declined to comment on the Rotterdam jobs move on Tuesday."
2017-10-10,"The health service will struggle to meet demand if it does not receive more money in the Budget next month, its chief executive has warned MPs.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171011034614/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-boss-warns-of-consequences-for-patient-care-if-funding-does-not-increase-11075281,"Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, told a parliamentary health committee that sticking to the current funding plans for the next two years would make it ""very hard"" to deliver services. Funding is scheduled to rise by an average of just 0.6% between next year and 2020, the tightest funding squeeze in NHS history. Mr Stevens said that if Chancellor Philip Hammond does not increase the funding in the Budget on November 22 there will be ""consequences"" for patient care. ""Looking forward to the pencilled-in funding for the next year and year after, it looks extremely challenging,"" he said. ""And if it is not amended it is going to be very hard for the NHS to do what is being asked of it. ""Prospects for next year and the year after depend on decisions that will be made on 22 November. ""It is right that democratic government decides (the) NHS budget but we should say that those decisions have consequences. Decisions taken on 22 November will determine the shape of the NHS for the next two years."" Mr Stevens' comments came as a report from the Care Quality Commission warned that the NHS is ""straining at the seams"" and that quality of care is ""precarious"" because of the huge demand on the health service. His direct call for extra money and the warning that any failure to deliver will endanger patients will heap pressure on Mr Hammond as he considers his first Autumn budget. Sky News understands that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has begun discussions with the Chancellor over an increase in health funding next year, but no final decision has been made. The Chancellor is already facing calls to fund the lifting of the 1% pay cap that has applied to public sector staff, including nurses, with new money rather than from existing budgets. Speaking earlier in Parliament Mr Hunt told MPs that ""the pay cap has been lifted"", but said any pay rise could depend on NHS staff delivering on productivity targets. Opposition parties and unions have demanded that any pay rise should not be funded from existing budgets, and Mr Stevens agreed. He said that it was not reasonable for staff to continue to live with pay cuts ""but a pay rise of that nature must be financed."" Mr Stevens also said he had not carried out any contingency planning for a ""no deal"" with the EU over Brexit. He said he had been encouraged by reassurance offered by Mr Hunt to the 150,000 EU staff employed in health and social care. ""I have not heard any noises that they will not remain welcome,"" he said."

She was 24 in 2008 when she got a 10-year term - later reduced to five on appeal - for assisting an offender and failing to disclose information about Osman's involvement. Shortly after her early release, the Ethiopian got a job with Southwark Council as a trainee customer services assistant - without declaring her conviction. The council failed to uncover her criminal past - which could have been found with a simple Google search - and she rose through the ranks to become a systems and performance analyst in the housing team. The 33-year-old even appeared on the cover of a council magazine to demonstrate the success of the apprenticeship scheme, according to The Sun. The council said she has since been sacked and denied she had access to sensitive lists of vulnerable council clients, including people on terror watch lists. Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark Council, said: ""The individual concerned no longer works for Southwark Council. ""As soon as her background came to light we took immediate action and terminated her employment. ""She did not disclose her full offence to the council. ""During her employment this individual never had access to police watch list data. ""We have fully reviewed her activity while she was employed at the council, including her computer usage, and no wrongdoing was uncovered. ""We have also undertaken a robust review of our processes and procedures in light of this incident."" Osman, along with Muktar Said Ibrahim, Yassin Omar and Ramzi Mohammed, tried to detonate rucksacks laden with explosives on three Underground trains at Shepherd's Bush station, Oval station and Warren Street station, together with a bus in Hackney Road, but the bombs failed to go off. The attempted attacks came two weeks after four suicide bombers struck in central London, killing 52 people and injuring more than 770. They were jailed for life in July 2007 after being convicted at London's Woolwich Crown Court of conspiracy to murder."
2017-10-10,North Korean hackers have reportedly stolen top-secret US-South Korea military documents - including details of a plan to assassinate Kim Jong Un. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171011034614/http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-hacked-into-us-south-korea-war-plans-11074878,"The South Korean Defence Ministry revealed hackers ""presumed to be North Koreans"" stole 235GB worth of documents while responding to a freedom of information request by Minjoo Party (Democratic Party) politician Rhee Cheol Hee. The hackers, according to South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo, obtained the documents by breaking into the military's intranet and related networks in August and September last year. Despite South Korean authorities previously claiming nothing of significance had leaked, reports have suggested Pyongyang gained access to OPLAN 5015 - South Korea's combined operations with the United States in a conflict with North Korea. The plan - reportedly devised in 2015 - is said to include a detailed strategy for the ""decapitation"" of the North Korean leadership in the event of a full-scale war, according to the Yonhap news agency. The Defence Ministry had only listed 53GB worth of the stolen data - about 10,700 documents or 22.5% of the total amount. Along with OPLAN 5015, documents included OPLAN 3100 - the South's strategy for dealing with its neighbours localised provocations. A contingency plan for the Special Warfare Command in the event of sudden changes in North Korea or a major provocation was also among the documents known to have been leaked. Rhee told the paper: ""I can't reveal further details because they are a military secret."" According to reports, the leaked files also include personnel reports of South Korean and American military officers and top secret minutes of meetings about South Korea-US military drills. The leaks also contain information on military installations and power plants in South Korea. According to Yonhap News, Pyongyang has denied responsibility for any cyber-attacks, criticising Seoul for ""fabricating"" the claims. The latest development comes amid months of growing tensions between the US and North Korea over its refusal to end its nuclear weapons programme. It has resulted in an ongoing war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid...... ...hasn't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work! At the weekend, the US leader said efforts with Pyongyang had broken down and that ""only one thing will work"". The swipe came after he threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea during his UN General Assembly address, insisting ""the United States is ready, willing and able (to act), but hopefully this will not be necessary"". The North Korean leader, who has continued to add to tensions with continued nuclear missile tests, addressed Mr Trump's previous comments and insisted ""a frightened dog barks louder""."

Known as malvertising - a portmanteau of ""malicious"" and ""advertising"" - the attack saw hackers hijack advertising platforms to deliver fake browser updates for the three most popular Windows browsers. Because advertising inventory can appear on high-profile websites, criminals are increasingly attempting to hijack these platforms to inject malware into a large number of victims' computers. The sophisticated filtering that ad networks offer to vendors can also be used by cyber criminals to target users running specific software containing vulnerabilities that can be exploited. The attack affecting PornHub and its advertising network was committed by a group known as KovCoreG, said Proofpoint, which attempted to infect browsers with the Kovter ad fraud malware. Advertising fraud is so prevalent on the internet that some advertisers only receive $0.01 for every $1 of impressions they pay for, according to independent ad fraud expert Dr Augustine Fou. The cyber criminals created fake advertisements that would appear as security warnings on the Chrome, Firefox and Edge web browsers - telling users they needed to apply a critical update. The fake advertisements encouraging users to infect themselves with the Kovter malware ""could just as easily have been ransomware, an information stealer, or any other malware"", said Proofpoint. ""Regardless, threat actors are following the money and looking to more effective combinations of social engineering, targeting, and pre-filtering to infect new victims at scale,"" the company added. It said that PornHub acted swiftly when notified of the malvertising to protect users. PornHub did not immediately respond to Sky News for comment."

They argued a government policy introduced in September 2016 called ""Adults At Risk"" defined torture too narrowly - meaning ""many"" vulnerable people were imprisoned. The policy said torture could only be carried out by official state agents or terror groups holding territory. But in his ruling, Mr Justice Ouseley found the Home Office definition ""lacked rational or evidence base"". The judgment states: ""The chief problem with the narrowed definition is that it excludes certain individuals whose experiences of the infliction of severe pain and suffering may indeed make them particularly vulnerable to harm in detention."" Mr Justice Ouseley also said the Home Office guidance would require medics to ""reach conclusions on political issues which they cannot rationally be asked to reach"". The charity Medical Justice accused the Government of adopting an unreasonably narrow definition of torture in policy changes made last September related to Article 1 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Uncat). Their QC argued at a hearing earlier this year that there was no ""lawful authorisation"" for replacing the broader meaning of torture under the Detention Centre Rules 2001, and the change did not comply with the Government's public sector equality duty under the Equality Act 2010. The seven detainees involved in the case included victims of trafficking, a man kidnapped by the Taliban and two men tortured because of their sexuality. The Home Office contested the action but has said it will not appeal against the ruling. The judgment could lead to dozens of claims for unlawful detention against the Government. Following the ruling, a spokeswoman for Medical Justice said: ""Narrowing the definition of torture by the Home Office demonstrates its sheer contempt for vulnerable detainees whose lives it is responsible for. ""The Home Office should have welcomed our evidence of the policy's harm suffered by torture victims, not dismissed it."" Mr PO, one of the former detainees who had challenged the Government, added: ""It affected me greatly to be subjected to this unlawful policy. It has left a scar in my life that will never be healed. ""I hope that the decision will benefit other survivors of torture held in immigration detention and it will prevent the Home Office from implementing a policy that will hurt vulnerable individuals in the future."""

But if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win."" The strained relationship between the President and America's top diplomat became public last week when NBC reported Vice President Mike Pence had to persuade Mr Tillerson not to quit during the summer and that Mr Tillerson had called the President a ""moron"". The former oil executive told reporters he had never considered resigning, but refused to address the reported insult. He said he wouldn't dignify ""petty nonsense"" and insisted he remained committed to the administration's foreign policy goals. Mr Tillerson's spokeswoman later said he never used such language. But the President's frequent interventions into Mr Tillerson's area have left many wondering how long his commitment will last. Mr Trump recently told his top diplomat he was wasting his time trying to reach a negotiated settlement with North Korea, something Mr Trump's incendiary tweets have rendered unlikely anyway. He has also given to his son-in-law Jared Kushner the task of leading the administration's efforts towards a Middle East peace deal, traditionally one of any Secretary of State's key areas of influence. But far from weakening Mr Tillerson, Mr Trump told Forbes he was being supportive. ""I'm not undermining... I think I'm actually strengthening authority,"" he said. The pair are scheduled to have lunch on Tuesday at the White House with Defence Secretary James Mattis."

Prosecutor Luke Ponte told Wood Green Crown Court the incident started with an altercation between a group of men, with some pushing and shoving. Mr Ponte said: ""There is no question as to who threw the acid. ""It was Arthur Collins. He does not dispute that he threw the acid and it is perhaps not surprising that he does not dispute it as the confrontation, the first throw, the second throwing and the third throwing are all captured quickly but clearly on the club's CCTV. ""He was assisted, and we'll come to how in a moment, by his good friend Andre Phoenix. ""The Crown's case is that these two friends came to the club together, armed with acid together, they stayed together, got drunk together, got in a fight together, threw it together, stayed around together and finally left together."" Jurors were shown CCTV of Collins and Phoenix arriving at the club at about 9pm before getting into a confrontation with a group of men around four hours later. Phoenix was one of the 16 people injured when he was splashed with the unidentified substance, which has a pH level of 1. Jurors heard that after the incident Collins asked one of the clubbers - Tamara-Jane Castle, who is also named on the indictment as a victim, to ""take a picture of my mate's face"". Mr Ponte said: ""Why did Mr Collins want a photograph? Mr Phoenix can be seen in that photo with markings from where the acid splashed him. ""It might be useful to Mr Collins to have a photo of his friend looking like he was a victim, rather than an attacker. This was before he had seen the CCTV."" The court also heard that Collins sent an iMessage to his sister one week before the incident, saying: ""Tell mum to Mind that little hand wash in my car acid"".

2017-10-10,"BAE Systems, Britain's biggest defence contractor, is to axe 2,000 jobs in a bitter blow for the country's manufacturing industry.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171011034614/http://news.sky.com/story/defence-giant-bae-to-axe-2000-uk-jobs-11074686,"The FTSE 100 company said the redundancies - across military, maritime and intelligence services - would be part of moves to streamline the business with a renewed focus on technology. Unions reacted with anger - describing the company as ""short-sighted"" and accusing the Government of ceding control of UK defence manufacturing to factories overseas. As Sky News exclusively reported on Monday, BAE confirmed the biggest cutbacks would fall in its military air business amid sluggish orders for its Eurofighter Typhoon and Hawk aircraft - forcing production to be slowed down. It said 1,400 jobs would go across five sites over the next three years. The Warton and Samlesbury plants in Lancashire - where the Typhoon is assembled - will bear the brunt of the losses, alongside its Brough factory in east Yorkshire. Operations in Portsmouth will be worst affected by plans to cut 375 staff from maritime servicing and support. The rest of the job losses, approximately 150 people, will affect cyber intelligence roles in London, Guildford and overseas. Nigel Whitehead, the company's group managing director of programmes and support, told Sky's Ian King Live that announcing the job cuts was a ""painful and horrible moment"". He added: ""We simply have to match the workforce to the flow of work to our business. ""We recognise that the Tornado aircraft is going to go out of service in 2019 and is ramping down. ""The best way of maximising the sales of the Typhoon, our leading fighter aircraft in the export market, is to actually slow down the rate of production so we have a constant rate of production... and a good basis for pricing into the export market for as long as we possibly can."" When asked if workers would be given the chance to be redeployed, he said: ""As a company, where we've gone through resizing and reshaping exercises within our business, we've always made every effort to mitigate job losses by retraining, redeploying... across our broad and diverse business across the UK."" The news was announced just three months after the company employed new chief executive Charles Woodburn and it announced a potential deal with Qatar for 24 Typhoons and six Hawks. Mr Woodburn said: ""These actions will further strengthen our company as we deliver our strategy in a changing environment."" Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said the job cuts ""would devastate communities across the UK and the hope of a decent future they give to future generations"". He added: ""The UK Government must take back control of our nation's defence and with it, play its part in supporting UK defence manufacturing jobs."" BAE employee Mick Darlington told Sky News the job cuts were ""not a great surprise"". The electrician, who is recently married and has a young daughter, said: ""This redundancy is the one we're most scared of because this is about losing a sovereign capability in this country for manufacturing fighter aircraft. ""If we lose these jobs, what are they going to be replaced with?"" Labour echoed that sentiment and called on ministers to bring forward spending on defence projects - such as replacing the ageing Red Arrows Hawk aircraft. A Government spokesman said: ""BAE Systems have taken this decision as a result of internal restructuring. It is clearly a concerning time for their workers and the Government stands ready to support those affected. ""Our MoD spent £3.7bn with BAE last year, and we also continually bang the drum for our world-leading defence industry right across the globe, supporting companies like BAE in securing contracts for UK-made equipment."""
2017-10-10,"Theresa May has said told both her Government and British society there ""isn’t anywhere to hide” after a study revealed sharp racial disparity.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171011034614/http://news.sky.com/story/new-race-survey-makes-for-uncomfortable-reading-says-campaigner-11074373,"Speaking to a roundtable meeting of campaigners at 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister said tackling ethnic injustice is her ""personal priority”. Organisations will be forced to “explain or change” over the report’s findings, Mrs May added, admitting the “findings will be uncomfortable” for public services. A new Government website, titled Ethnicity Facts and Figures, which went live on Tuesday, unveiled data covering 130 topics from 12 Whitehall departments. The findings included: :: Black people are more than six times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than White people :: Ethnic minority householders are less likely to be in owner-occupied properties than White British households - except for Indian, mixed White and Asian and Pakistani households who have similar rates of home ownership :: Black Caribbean pupils are permanently excluded from schools at three times the rate of White British pupils :: Asian households are underrepresented in new social housing lettings - particularly Indian and Pakistani households Attending the PM's diversity event at Number 10 were a number of campaigners, including Jabeer Butt from the Race Equality Foundation, Omar Khan from the Runnymede Trust, Kunle Olulode from Voice4Change and Matilda MacAttram from Black Mental Health. The Prime Minister told the meeting: “What this audit shows is there isn't anywhere to hide. ""That's not just for Government, it's for society as a whole. ""Britain has come along way in promoting equality and opportunity but what the data we've published today shows is that we still have a way to go if we are going to truly have a country that works for everyone."" Prior to the discussion, Mrs May had examined the audit’s findings with her Cabinet. The Prime Minister's spokesman said Mrs May had described how, on a school visit on Monday in south London, she had met a black student who had wanted to be a lawyer. However, having seen the lack of diversity in the judiciary, the student told the Prime Minister he wondered if it was a profession in which he could progress. ""She was clearly touched by the boy's story,"" the spokesman said. In a statement to the House of Commons on the audit’s findings, First Secretary of State Damian Green told MPs the audit is ""unprecedented in scale, scope and transparency"". He warned “there is much more still to do if we are to end racial injustice” but denied the report is “unrelentingly negative” about the situation for ethnic minorities in Britain - pointing to similar levels of home ownership to white people among some ethnic groups. Dawn Butler, Labour’s shadow secretary for women and equalities, welcomed the collation of Government data but stressed “what matters most is what the Government is going to do about the problems identified”. Munira Mirza, one of Boris Johnson's former deputy mayors in London, warned the Government's racial disparity audit risks stoking grievances amongst ethnic minority communities. She expressed concern over how ministers have “framed this in terms of racial injustice and explained the disparities between groups in terms of unfair treatment by the system”. Mr Johnson's ex-education adviser told Sky News: ""It's inaccurate because there are many complex reasons why there are disparities between groups, and it's not always about the colour of their skin. ""Very often it's not, and it's certainly not always about discrimination. Apart from being misleading and inaccurate, I think it can stoke grievance.”"

Despite still suffering from severe vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum), she looked relaxed and was showing signs of a tiny baby bump. The palace has not announced when the baby is due but it is believed Kate is less than 12 weeks pregnant. A royal aide said: ""The Duchess' condition is improving but she's still suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. She's delighted to be here tonight."" The Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry met leading figures in the mental health sector at the reception, including Mind president and comic Stephen Fry. At an event earlier in the day, Prince William explained in a speech that it was his wife who first decided the trio should join together to focus on mental health. William said: ""It was Catherine who first realised that all three of us were working on mental health in our individual areas of focus. ""She had seen that at the core of adult issues like addiction and family breakdown, unresolved childhood mental health issues were often part of the problem. ""Harry had seen that it wasn't enough to help veterans recover from their physical injuries without acknowledging the emotional and mental support they required. ""And after years of working with the homeless, and having been called out to multiple scenes of suicide as a search and rescue and then HEMS (helicopter emergency medical services) pilot, I understood the damage poor mental health was causing to our communities and for our families."" The Duchess has not been seen in public since 30 August, when she joined William and Harry at an event to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of Princess Diana. The couple were forced to announce that they were expecting their third child when she had to cancel a public appearance on 4 September due to sickness. Kate also suffered from the condition when she was expecting Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Normal morning sickness affects about 70% of pregnant women and causes some degree of vomiting and discomfort normally in the first trimester (12 weeks) of pregnancy, but those suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum can be constantly sick throughout the day. So far, no further royal engagements have been announced for the Duchess of Cambridge and its understood this appearance does not mean she will be resuming full royal duties just yet."
2017-10-10,Harvey Weinstein's wife has announced she is leaving him following a series of sexual harassment claims made against the Hollywood mogul.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171011034614/http://news.sky.com/story/gwyneth-paltrow-and-angelina-jolie-claim-harvey-weinstein-made-unwanted-advances-11075467,"British fashion designer Georgina Chapman described her husband's behaviour as ""unforgivable"" and said ""my heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain"". It comes amid claims Weinstein raped three women and admitted groping a model in a recording obtained by The New Yorker. Hollywood stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie have also accused the movie producer of making unwanted advances towards them. Weinstein continues to ""unequivocally deny"" allegations of non-consensual sex against him, and of illegal sexual harassment. In a statement, his wife told People magazine: ""I have chosen to leave my husband. ""Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time."" The couple married in 2007 and have two children together - India Pearl, seven, and Dashiell Max Robert, four. Former US president Barack Obama said he and his wife Michelle were left ""disgusted"" by the allegations against Weinstein, who has been a major donor to the Democratic Party since the early 1990s. Mr Obama added: ""Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status."" Paltrow claimed she was propositioned by Weinstein after he hired her to star in Emma when she was 22 years old. The star told The New York Times that during a meeting in his hotel suite the film producer placed his hands on her and suggested they head to the bedroom for massages. ""I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,"" she said. Paltrow said she refused his advances and ended up telling her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt, who confronted him, which resulted in Weinstein warning her not to tell anyone else. It left her believing ""he was going to fire me"", she said. The actress went on to work with Weinstein again a few years later on Shakespeare In Love, for which she won a Best Actress Oscar and Golden Globe. Jolie said she ""had a bad experience"" with Weinstein in her youth, causing her to never work with the producer again and warning others about his conduct. The claims come as The New Yorker alleges Asia Argento, an Italian actress, told the magazine Weinstein forcibly performed a sex act on her. She and two other women also allege that Weinstein raped them, The New Yorker claimed. Meanwhile, a police recording has emerged purporting to be of Weinstein trying to persuade an Italian model to enter his hotel room. The New Yorker published the recording in a story that also featured further allegations against Weinstein, who was fired from the company he founded following claims of sexual harassment. The recording, said to be made by New York Police Department, apparently features a conversation between the film producer and Ambra Battilana Gutierrez at the entrance to his hotel room. Gutierrez is heard telling Weinstein clearly she is ""not comfortable"" with the situation as he tells her repeatedly to come and sit next to him and to go to the bathroom after saying he is going to have a shower. Towards the end of the recording, Gutierrez asks Weinstein: ""Why yesterday you touch my breast?"", to which he responds: ""Oh, please, I'm sorry, just come on in. I'm used to that. Come on. Please."" Gutierrez responds: ""You're used to that?"" to which Weinstein says: ""Yes, come in."" She then tells him: ""No, but I'm not used to that,"" to which he replies: ""I won't do it again, come on, sit here."" Earlier in the recording, Weinstein is heard saying: ""I'm telling you right now, get in here. ""I'm going to take a shower. You sit there and have a drink."" When Gutierrez asks if she can stay by the bar, he tells her: ""No, you must come here now."" Gutierrez tells him: ""Yesterday was kind of aggressive for me. I need to know a person to be touched. He says: ""I won't do a thing. I swear I won't, just sit with me. Don't embarrass me in the hotel, I'm here all the time."" The producer then appears to use language that is increasingly more direct, telling Gutierrez: ""If you do this now, you will embarrass me. Now go. Bye. Never call me again. Okay? I'm sorry, nice to have…I promise you I won't do anything."" He adds: ""The guy is coming. I will never do another thing to you. Five minutes. Don't ruin your friendship with me for five minutes."" When she says it's ""too much"" for her, he tells her: ""Please, you're making a big scene,"" before, when she still will not submit, saying: ""Okay. Bye. Thank you."" Manhattan District Attorney's office said the recording was arranged by the NYPD in 2015 without its input and as a result its prosecutors were not able to discuss with investigators what was necessary to capture to prove a sex crime. Chief Assistant DA Karen Friedman-Agnifilo said: ""If we could have prosecuted Harvey Weinstein for the conduct that occurred in 2015, we would have. ""While the recording is horrifying to listen to, what emerged from the audio was insufficient to prove a crime under New York law, which requires prosecutors to establish criminal intent. ""This, coupled with other proof issues, meant that there was no choice but to conclude the investigation without criminal charges."" In his latest statement, Weinstein denied ""there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances"". The multiple Oscar winner had taken a voluntary leave of absence from the Weinstein Company after the harassment allegations were detailed in The New York Times last week. The firm he founded with his brother Bob sacked him on Sunday evening after several women claimed he had harassed them."

The company claimed the attackers attempted to take credit and debit card numbers and expiry dates, but not the names, PINs or CVV numbers associated with the cards. ""While there is no evidence that any data has been stolen at this point, Musgrave is advising any concerned shoppers to review activity on their statements as a precautionary measure,"" the company said in a statement. The attack has been reported to the Garda and the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. Musgrave's SuperValu stores have more than a fifth of the supermarket share in Ireland. The company also operates stores in Northern Ireland, and it is understood customers on both sides of the border were targeted in the attack. ""Cyber breach response experts"" are applying ""advanced technical fixes"" to deal with the breach, the retail giant added. In response to questions from Sky News, Musgrave explained that it is still assessing the extent of the hackers' attempted extraction of customer data. It said it spotted an extraction attempt on Monday afternoon and does not yet know when it had been compromised by the malware."

In the manifesto, the party said the charter would ""put a responsibility on industry not to direct users - even unintentionally - to hate speech, pornography, or other sources of harm"". The strategy proposes a code of practice for social media companies which would create ""a joined-up approach to remove or address bullying, intimidating or humiliating online content"". The leading minister, Karen Bradley MP, said: ""The Internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people."" It follows the announcement of a new national police hub being set up to crack down on online abuse and trolls. It also sees through a manifesto Digital Charter pledge to create a new tax on social media companies to fund programmes raising awareness and countering ""internet harms"". The strategy also suggests a greater role for the education system in helping children use services online in a safe manner. Two new subjects would be introduced in schools, Relationship Education at primary, and Relationship and Sex Education at secondary, to provide online safety education. Confirmed in the Queen's Speech, the Digital Charter has ignited concerns from digital rights groups about the possible implications for civil liberties. In the manifesto, the party said it would also introduce a sanctions regime for companies that fail to meet their legal duties in regards to content that is deemed in breach of law. The difficulties in establishing whether content could be illegal or not were highlighted earlier this year when YouTube deleted an archive of video evidence of potential war crimes in Syria. In 2012, Twitter user Paul Chambers had his conviction overturned in the High Court after a joke threat on the messaging platform: ""Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your s*** together, otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!"" The proposed strategy is out for consultation until Thursday 7 December, and the Government said it expects to provide a response in early 2018."

Ivana Trump had told ABC's Good Morning America: ""I have the direct number to White House. ""But I'm not really going to call him there because Melania is there, and I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, because I'm basically first Trump wife, okay? I'm First Lady, okay?"" She added: ""I think for her to be in Washington must be terrible. It's better her than me. I would hate Washington."" Mrs Trump, a 47-year-old Slovenian-born jewellery designer and former model, fired back through her communications chief Stephanie Grisham, who issued a sharply worded statement. ""Mrs Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President,"" she said, referring to the couple's 11-year-old son. ""She loves living in Washington DC, and is honoured by her role as First Lady of the United States. ""She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books,"" she said, adding: ""There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex, this is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise."" In a separate interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Ivana Trump appeared to have a dig at Mr Trump's second wife, Marla Maples, who famously began a relationship with the billionaire businessman while he was still married to her. ""I don't talk about her,"" she said. ""She's a showgirl. Never achieve anything in her life."" Andy Cohen, the executive producer of the Real Housewives franchise, said he was lost for words by the clash. ""This is actually happening. All the wives are fighting.

They divorced 15 years later following rumours Mr Trump was having an affair with American actress Marla Maples. Maples gave birth to their daughter Tiffany in October 1993 and married Mr Trump two months later. Melania met Mr Trump in September 1998, while he was separated from his second wife - with the tycoon divorcing Maples in June 1999.

2017-10-10,A Prime Minister considered on the brink.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171011034614/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-a-prime-minister-on-life-support-11073285,"Talk of a leadership election abounds and the party conference season descends. Party consiglieri whisper that it's a ""make or break"" week for the Prime Minister and all eyes are on the all-important leader's speech. That's right. It's 1969 and Harold Wilson is leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister. He addresses the leadership questions: ""I know what is going on"" he says, impishly surveying the room. ""I am going on."" Almost instantly his leadership was saved, by a single quip. But then, he got his words out. It should never have even mattered. Had Theresa May won a majority of 100, if the Brexit negotiations were going well, if the vultures weren't circling, this week, as excruciating as it was, Theresa May's cough and set malfunction would not have been a problem. But it was a torrid week at the end of an even more torrid six months, leaving every pundit, politician and pollster in Westminster wondering: how long can she last? She has two strong cards left in her much-depleted deck. The first is that most Tory MPs feel that it would not only appear ridiculous but be actively damaging to the Brexit process to dispatch a Prime Minister before at least a significant portion of the negotiations are complete. Interestingly though, this week has changed something. It has added the ""significant portion"" bit of that sentence. Before this week, most Tory MPs thought that it would be most sensible for the PM to stay until 2019, when Britain leaves the EU and the negotiations are complete. I've detected a significant change in tone over the weekend. Lots of Conservative MPs are talking about her now only completing part of it, perhaps securing a transition deal (as she outlined in her Florence speech) and then leaving the second part (negotiating an ongoing trade relationship) to someone else. Secondly, the PM still has the power to hire and fire. It wasn't only May who failed to impress at party conference. The feeling amongst activists was that much of the Cabinet appeared tired and jaded, with few if any sparkling performances. There's a great appetite to rejuvenate the Conservative brand through fresh ideas and new faces. Many MPs would like May to fulfil a near caretaker role, ditching the deadwood and bringing forward 2015 and 2017 MPs into the top ranks of government. It suits those MPs (and they are now a very significant portion of the parliamentary party) for May to stay on for a while. If she went now, one of the old praetorian guard would have to take over - a Johnson, a Davis, a Hammond. Far better to keep May in place, get cabinet experience and then go for the top job in a year or so: young cardinals like old popes. But however much those ""young Turks"" might like May to hang around, it may soon be out of her hands. She may have (just) survived the conference season but doing so came at a cost: her last life. She is one move - a scandal, a crisis bungled, a situation misjudged - away from being politically dead. And the political landscape is riddled with landmines. There's Brexit and the eight related bills making their way through Parliament, all of which are subject to nefarious amendments from trouble-making MPs on the opposition and Government benches (not to mention the Lords). There's the upcoming energy bill: a signature domestic initiative with which many free-marketeer Tory MPs are uncomfortable because it imposes a statist energy cap on a privatised industry and worse, looks suspiciously like an Ed Miliband idea. Any significant rebellion on the Conservative side could wound the Prime Minister beyond repair. And the reshuffle could disastrously backfire. For every loyalty bought with a 50 pieces of silver in the form of a place around the Cabinet table, there is a cost. A dispatched and sullen minister is free to roam on the backbenches and to cause trouble, none more so than Johnson. In allowing speculation to build up over the weekend that she might move him, May is in an invidious position. Move him and create a blonde-mopped king over the water. Don't move him and be a pusillanimous pansy and prove once again, just how feeble she's become. Any of these would try a strong Prime Minister with a solid majority. She could anticipate them arising and that's exactly why she called an election to try and get one. A Prime Minister on life support could be brought down by any one of them. Maybe the Prime Minister could do worse to look back to old Harold Wilson for inspiration. He led a minority government. He had huge egos to manage in his Cabinet. And he was perhaps the only Prime Minister in our history who, leading a divided party, successfully managed to navigate the issue of Europe. On the other side of the ledger, three Tory prime ministers in a row have been brought down over the subject. May is a hair's breadth away from being the fourth."

The committee meeting comes after TfL refused to renew Uber's licence on the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"" relating to issues such as the reporting of serious criminal offences. ""The company accepts that in lots of places it has had the wrong attitude and needs to change,"" Mr Byrne told MPs. ""There was a high strength of feeling from people in the business, but I think we have got to the place where we accept we need to do more to address TfL's concerns. ""I think we are very conscious of the fact that 40,000 people do earn money through Uber in London. That fact weighs very heavily on our response. :: Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi apologises to London for 'mistakes we've made' ""But hopefully we can see a path forward now with TfL where we can address their concerns and continue to operate."" Mr Byrne said Uber's technology enables the company to ""be far more helpful in holding people to account with police investigations than a traditional private hire operator or taxi company"". He added the firm is considering a policy which would block drivers from taking fares for more than 10-12 hours during a 24-hour period, in order to reduce the risk of them driving tired."

He stressed the importance of having ""that honest conversation now"" in preparation for serious incidents in future after a ransomware worm caused havoc for the NHS back in May. Only 47 out of approximately 20,000 health organisations were affected by the WannaCry ransomware worm, according to Mr Taylor - meaning ""the impact was quite small"" in context. This was not to underplay the cancellation of outpatient visits and the turning away of patients from Accident and Emergency wards, but ""as a dress rehearsal - as a 'lesson learned' - it was good"". He added: ""It raised awareness of how cybersecurity can actually impact patient-facing services."" Mr Taylor had no doubt that health services will be severely impacted by cybersecurity incidents in the future - comparing his job to that of a doctor. It may not be possible to prevent infection and injury both in healthcare and in cybersecurity, but expecting them and having the proper processes in place to respond was vital. He said: ""Things will go wrong, and when they do go wrong actually you need the right systems, processes and people in place to actually limit that. ""We don't know what the worst case scenario could be. ""For too long we've been too timid, where actually if we said, do you know what, in future we're going to lose a battle along the way, a hospital may have to close its doors. ""I think if we have that honest conversation now, we're much likely better to prepare ourselves for that eventuality."" NHS Digital's data security centre helps ""organisations suffering from small attacks or issues on a daily basis"", he told Sky News. The team monitors the national network to block malicious traffic and sends out a weekly bulletin informing cybersecurity teams across the NHS of matters that need their attention, and in high-severity situations alerts will go out ""within four hours"". In a more proactive way, it takes ""feeds and intelligence from numerous international sources, from GCHQ or the National Cyber Security Centre, our partners across borders, and we're always looking for threats that are out there that could be applicable to health"". Referring to May's incident, Mr Taylor added: ""The thing that hit home for healthcare providers was how digital services underpin their patient services."" But he added: ""I'm sick of talking about WannaCry, I'm just going to be honest with you, because WannaCry is one attack vector that happened. ""If we focus on that one thing, then next time it happens, we'll go: 'We're really good at protecting that bit, oh but we forgot this bit' - and actually we need to think about defence in depth."" Mr Taylor said he believes the state of cybersecurity within the NHS is ""improving"", adding: ""I think WannaCry has been a really good event for us. I know that sounds counter-intuitive, but I think sometimes it takes a wake-up call."""

As expected, that meant the publication of outline plans for what No Deal would mean to our customs and trade system. This matters to Brexiteer ultras, but the more telling matter was that no money has been set aside, no land bought, no customs officers employed. It is a paper trade designed, by talking about No Deal, to avoid it ever happening. The Government did not sign up to the views of its former or current Cabinet ministers that No Deal would be perfectly fine. Instead, the PM did something really quite unexpected. She told Jacob Rees-Mogg, to his face, on the floor of the Commons that, yes, the European Court of Justice would be maintaining its jurisdiction during the transition phase. Officially, that is, until an alternative dispute resolution mechanism (an EFTA-type court for UK-EU) can be negotiated. In practice this will take at least two years. This may well have been the obvious implication of Mrs May's Florence speech, but it was not clearly stated, and the PM did not, for example, choose to clarify the same point in her Sky News interview last week. On Monday she did, choosing to dispense with the fudge, clear the fog, and try to get down to actual business. Mr Rees-Mogg was ""concerned"" and told Sky News that the PM had gone ""further than I wished her to go on ECJ jurisdiction during transition"". Bill Cash said MPs were keen to study the detail. Other Brexiteers said they were ""relaxed"" and could stomach the ECJ for another ""two years"". But this clearly crossed the private red lines of some Cabinet ministers, and the public ones expressed just before the Tory conference by Boris Johnson. No matter, the Foreign Secretary was soon to be found agreeing with the PM entirely on transition and agreeing with Michael Gove that the focus should be on the end state. Indeed Number 10 advisers say they have managed to convince all but a handful of MPs that she needs to focus all her ""negotiating capital not on a transition but on the end state"". It has, for now, worked. The PM has carried her Cabinet towards a position supporting a multi-year transition with full payments and ECJ jurisdiction. It may yet provide a few queasy moments in the Commons. The real question: will it unlock progress with the European Union? Perhaps it will create some goodwill that reaches ""sufficient progress"" by December. The question: whether her backbenchers will stomach more compromises on their pure ""clean Brexit"". So far it seems the PM calculates, as I argued last month, that her backbenchers will cash in their chips, and not risk their Brexit for No Brexit or a Corbyn Brexit. We want to save our negotiating capital for the end state."

She has repeatedly claimed ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" and her comments come a day after the Government published two white papers on the impact of a 'no-deal' scenario on customs and trade.

The panel heard that just 1% of the 2.5bn disposable cups we throw away every year are being recycled, and that without urgent action that figure will continue to rise. Speaking afterwards, Ms Creagh told Sky News: ""The manufacturers seem to be saying it's all too difficult to make a cup that matches what the standard needs to be and we can't use recycled materials in it because they could be contaminated with food waste. ""So it's a bit of a collective shrug that it's all too difficult to deal with."" :: Sky to remove all single-use plastic by 2020 Many people are under the impression that takeaway cups are entirely recyclable, but standard cardboard cups contain a thin layer of plastic which makes them waterproof. It also makes them more difficult to recycle and just a few of the UK's 47 paper mills will take them. Representing Costa on the panel, the company's environment manager Oliver Rosevear said making all takeaway cups recyclable is only a small part of the solution. He said: ""You can have the most recyclable cup out there but if it actually isn't put in the right bin it's not going to get recycled. ""It is mostly general waste bins on the street and that is where the challenge exists. ""There is a huge amount we need to do about engaging the consumer, but also it's about making sure everyone is aware through the right signage and messages how they can recycle.""

The firm admitted supplying water unfit for human consumption at an earlier hearing and will also have to pay £150,000 in prosecution costs. Cryptosporidium can cause diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting if ingested. The lack of safe drinking water caused supermarkets to restrict the amount of bottled water bought per customer after there was a surge of panic buyers. United Utilities has so far spent £25m so far, including £18.3m in voluntary compensation to householders and businesses affected, providing one million bottles of drinking water at the time of the contamination and donating thousands of pounds to charity. Preston Crown Court heard that the contamination happened because the parasite found its way into a service reservoir with structural defects that was holding treated water. The company, which has an annual turnover of £1.7bn, has invested £100m into improving its treatment process so further contamination does not occur, the court heard. There was no outbreak of cryptosporidium disease as a result of the contamination - with the judge accepting there was no evidence to suggest the contaminated water caused people to fall ill. Honorary recorder of Preston Judge Mark Brown said United Utilities did not carry out risk assessments which could have prevented the outbreak. He said: ""It was the largest event of its kind since the privatisation of the water industry many years ago and it had a major impact on day to day water consumption. ""There was significant disruption to domestic consumers but also to businesses as well."" United Utilities' chief executive Steve Mogford said the firm was ""very sorry for the impact this has had on our customers"". ""I know from first-hand the inconvenience this incident caused, having lived in Lancashire for 40 years,"" he added. ""We have learned valuable lessons from what happened and have put technology and processes in place to guard against a repeat of this type of incident."""

It is unclear if the document signed by Mr Puigdemont and his allies has any legal basis. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called an emergency cabinet meeting for Wednesday morning, when Madrid will decide how to respond. In a sign the Spanish government is in no mood to talk, deputy prime minister Saenz de Santamaria said Mr Puigdemont ""doesn't know where he is, where he is going and with whom he wants to go"". One of the options open to Mr Rajoy is the unprecedented step of dissolving Catalonia's parliament and taking direct control of the region under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, something that has been referred to as the ""nuclear option"". Madrid could also ask the courts to strike down the declaration of independence as unconstitutional. In a highly anticipated speech earlier, Mr Puigdemont told the regional parliament in Barcelona he accepted the ""mandate of the people"" of Catalonia for a split. However, he asked the Catalan parliament to ""suspend the effects of the independence declaration to initiate dialogue in the coming weeks"". Mr Puigdemont criticised the Spanish government's response to the region's disputed independence referendum, but said Catalans have nothing against Spain or Spaniards. He said: ""We're not criminals, we're not mad. We're normal people who want to vote."" Although Mr Puigdemont stopped short of seeking the explicit support of the chamber for the declaration in a formal vote, his gambit plunges Spain into the unknown. Voters in Catalonia backed independence in a referendum last weekend, a poll that was declared illegal by Madrid even before it took place. Although 92% of those who voted backed secession, only 43% of Catalans cast a ballot. The Spanish government was the subject of international condemnation for its response to the vote, which saw rubber bullets fired and batons used on crowds. Responding to Mr Puigdemont's speech, a Spanish government official said Madrid did not accept Catalonia's ""implicit"" independence declaration, while the opposition leader in Catalonia's parliament accused Mr Puigdemont of a ""coup"". Madrid has previously promised action to ""restore law and democracy"" if Catalonia presses ahead with independence. Tuesday's proclamation makes a negotiated settlement more difficult, as Mr Rajoy has said he would not talk to Catalan leaders until they drop plans for secession. European leaders have also come out against an independence declaration, amid concerns about Spain's biggest constitutional crisis since its transition to democracy in the wake of the death of military dictator Francisco Franco in 1975."

Between 1975 and 2016 the estimated number of obese boys in the world increased from six million to 74 million. For girls figures rose from five million to 50 million. Professor Majid Ezzati from Imperial College London, whose team contributed to the research, told Sky News: ""Whilst there have been some initiatives led by governments, communities and schools to raise awareness about child and adolescent obesity, most high income countries have been reluctant to use taxes and industry regulations to change eating and drinking behaviours to tackle child obesity."" It is mainly developing countries that have seen a rise in obesity levels. In Europe and the United States, figures have plateaued. Nonetheless, a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) suggests childhood obesity is still growing in the poorest communities in the UK, with one in 10 young people now classed as obese in this country. In cities like Bristol, healthy schools programmes have been introduced. At Hillcrest Primary pupils are taught about the importance of a balanced diet and keeping active. But with increasing pressures, particularly on young girls, to conform to certain stereotypes, teachers say it's all about striking the right balance. Deputy Head, Bridget Norman said: ""I think children, no matter what age, are always thinking about their appearance and how they look but I think so long as we focus on the positive side, about healthiness, rather than the vanity side then it's ok."" In PE lessons at Hillcrest children said they did not like the idea of being plump or fat and so exercise was important to them, as was limiting sugary treats. There is now mounting pressure on the government to take action against big sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks brands, who spend more than £140m on advertising each year. The government itself is only able to spend a fraction of that on promoting healthy eating campaigns. The WHO also recommends that countries introduce taxes on sugary drinks, as well as clear packaging labels and a ban on unhealthy snacks that are often provided in schools. There is a concern that younger generations are obsessed not only with smart phones and computer screens, but also sugar. Many believe that could cripple the NHS in the years to come and damage the health of future generations. Dr Alison Tedstone, Chief Nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ""It's taken many years for us to reach this point and change will not happen overnight. ""England is at the forefront of addressing childhood obesity - our sugar reduction programme and the Government's sugar levy are world-leading but this is just the beginning of a long journey to tackle the challenge of a generation."""

The 31-year-old denies murdering the toddler at the couple's four-bedroom home in Llandaff, Cardiff. Giving evidence at Cardiff Crown Court, Craig Scully-Hicks told the jury he had never heard his husband shout at Elsie, nor her adopted sibling. ""I need to be clear here,"" he said. ""My house was filled with love and happiness. All the time. If I had suspected anything I wouldn't have tolerated it."" Wales Ambulance Service received an emergency call from Matthew Scully-Hicks at about 6.20pm on 25 May 2016. Paramedics found Elsie was not breathing, with no signs of a heartbeat, and took her to the University Hospital of Wales. She died in hospital four days later, on 29 May 2016. Prosecutors allege Matthew Scully-Hicks ""assaulted, abused and ultimately murdered"" the little girl. Examinations at the hospital found Elsie had suffered bleeding on both sides of her brain. A post-mortem revealed she had also suffered several broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. The court was told that Matthew Scully-Hicks wrote messages commenting on his adopted daughter's personality before her death. One, sent 11 days after Elsie was placed with the family, described the toddler as having had ""a proper diva strop"". In another, he allegedly called her ""a psycho"" and described her as ""Satan dressed up in a Babygro"" to his husband. The prosecution allege the messages suggest he was ""struggling to cope"". But Craig Scully-Hicks, describing the situation at home after the couple adopted Elsie, told the court she was ""great"". He added: ""She was good apart from her sleeping. She liked to nap but she liked to get up again a couple of hours later."" Neighbours allegedly heard Elsie crying and Matthew Scully-Hicks shouting ""shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up"", the court heard. On one occasion, he allegedly shouted ""shut up you little f****** brat"". Craig Scully-Hicks, who said he spent two to three days a week working away from home, said he had ""never"" heard his husband refer to Elsie in that way. Matthew Scully-Hicks denies murder. The trial continues."

Campaigners welcomed the move as a step towards reform of a system they say exposes vulnerable people to indefinite confinement, inhumane conditions and trauma. ""The is the biggest single step away from the mass detention of migrants the Home Office has taken,"" Jerome Phelps, director of campaign group Detention Action, told Sky News. A spokesperson for the Home Office said the closure was ""part of ongoing modernisation work"". The news comes on the day a High Court decision ruled a flawed definition of torture had led to hundreds of torture victims being detained in UK immigration centres illegally. Around 30,000 people enter the immigration system each year, often before being deported after a rejected asylum claim, overstaying a visa, or while an immigration application is reviewed. In 2016, the Government said it expected to reduce the number of people in immigration detention, pitching a raft of reforms in response to an independent review. But recent investigations have raised the alarm over conditions at the UK's centres, where between 2,500 and 3,500 people in total are held at any one time. Security firm G4S suspended employees after a Panorama documentary showed staff abusing inmates at Brook House centre, where drug use was allegedly ""rife"". In the last month alone three people have died in detention centres. There is also no time limit for detention, and though most people are held for less than two months some remain for more than a year. The Verne was judged by assessments to be operating satisfactorily. But its location, in a former barracks on Dorset's Isle of Portland, is cut off from most migrant communities and support organisations, leaving detainees feeling isolated, Mr Phelps said. ""There is a sense of people being abandoned and forgotten about,"" he said. The Verne will be emptied by the end of December, and future immigration removal places will be concentrated around airports, according to a Home Office letter seen by Sky News."

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures come as part of a study on migration patterns between the UK and other member states within the Brussels bloc. The influx of people moving from Romania and Bulgaria comes after the countries - referred to as the EU2 - were granted unrestricted rights to live and work in Britain in 2014. The rights were granted seven years after the states had officially joined the European Union. ONS deputy director for population statistics Rich Pereira said: ""The picture of migration between the UK and the EU2 countries clearly shows a somewhat lopsided balance of movement, with the UK evidently proving an attractive labour market for Romanian and Bulgarian citizens since those countries' full accession to the EU. ""This presents an obvious area of concern for both those large numbers of citizens who have moved to the UK, and for the jobs they have been doing, as the UK continues its negotiations to leave the EU."" The 413,000 figure for last year eclipses the 234,000 recorded two years earlier. The study shows 78% of the 328,400 EU2 citizens in the UK between the start of 2014 and the end of 2016 were from Romania - a total of 256,800 people. A total of 71,700 - 22% - of EU2 citizens during the same period were Bulgarian. The figures showed 81% of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in Britain over the three years were aged between 16 and 64. Almost four in five of those people were in employment. Just 4% of those of working age were thought to be unemployed, 5% were inactive due to study and the 12% were ""otherwise economically inactive"". The ONS statistics come as the UK and the EU continue to thrash out Brexit talks, with Britain hoping to secure rights for the estimated three million EU nationals in the UK and one million Britons living in EU states. Prime Minister Theresa May has since admitted during an LBC phone-in that ""we don't know what's going to happen"" to EU nationals in Britain if negotiators fail to reach a deal, but she insisted they were ""very close"" on citizens' rights."

As head of the armed forces, Remembrance Sunday is seen as a significant event in the Queen's royal diary. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman added: ""The Queen wishes to be alongside the Duke of Edinburgh and he will be in the balcony."" The Palace also confirmed to Sky News that it is not the first time the Queen has not placed a wreath on Remembrance Sunday. She missed the event while she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, and when she has been overseas on tours. It has also been announced that Prince Philip's equerry will lay his wreath. It was announced in May that the Duke was retiring from public duties, but the palace said he would still appear alongside the Queen for some engagements. Buckingham Palace said this year's arrangements may not necessarily be the same for next year's service. On Tuesday, the Queen flew back from Scotland after spending the summer in Balmoral.

She has already handed some official duties to younger members of the family, as three generations are now full-time working royals The Queen also no longer carries out overseas tours."
2017-10-11,Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has threatened to remove Catalonia's regional autonomy after an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss how to respond to Catalan separatists signing an independence declaration.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/spanish-government-meets-for-crisis-talks-after-catalonia-declares-independence-11075833,"In a televised address, he asked the region's leader Carles Puigdemont to clarify whether independence had already been declared - before the Spanish government decides how to react. Mr Puigdemont has insisted Catalans have earned the right to independence but that separatists would delay implementing it for several weeks to give dialogue with Madrid a chance. But Spain's deputy prime minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria immediately rejected any notion of talks following a referendum which was deemed illegal, saying Mr Puigdemont ""doesn't know where he is, where he is going and with whom he wants to go"". The cabinet is looking at a range of ways to deal with the separatist leaders and could include the ""nuclear option"" - suspending Catalonia's autonomy, taking over control of the region and sending in the national police. The move would be a risk for Mr Rajoy, who for the first time in a veiled threat on Wednesday said clarity was ""a requirement for any measure the government can adopt under Article 155 of the constitution"". It would allow Madrid to suspend the region's political institutions and impose its authority. While many in Catalonia oppose independence they cling fiercely to their high degree of self-governance and would baulk at any interference from central government. The national police were also condemned for their aggression in trying to stop the referendum and many Catalans would not be comfortable with their presence in large numbers. However, Mr Rajoy will want to be seen to be sticking to his hard line against separatists - and has decided to launch a constitutional reform, with the backing of Spain's opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez, that could change the way the country's 17 autonomous regions are governed. The Spanish PM has not ruled out arresting Mr Puigdemont and other pro-independence figures, but that would play into the hand of separatists whose leaders could become martyrs to the cause. Mr Rajoy has come under pressure to soften his stance on negotiations and European Council President Donald Tusk is among the latest to urge him to sit across the table from Mr Puigdemont. The Catalan leader's speech seemed to be cast in overtures of compromise as he said separatists have nothing against Spain or Spaniards. Mr Puigdemont added: ""We're not criminals, we're not mad. We're normal people who want to vote."" Despite this, the signing of an independence declaration will be viewed by Madrid as an act of provocation and Mr Rajoy will struggle to find a way to respond that satisfies everyone."
2017-10-11,"Egg soldiers are back on the menu for pregnant women, infants and the elderly under new advice issued by the UK's food safety watchdog.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/sunny-side-up-please-runny-eggs-safe-to-eat-again-says-food-safety-watchdog-11075898,"They can enjoy their eggs sunny side up for the first time in 30 years - since the salmonella crisis - because the Food Standard Agency has revised its guidance on eating runny yolks following a new study. A report by the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) found the presence of salmonella in British eggs has ""dramatically reduced"" in recent years. The risks are also ""very low"" for eggs carrying the British Lion mark - which account for more than 90% of eggs in the UK. Those that are not produced according to the British Lion code, non-hen eggs and imported eggs should still be cooked thoroughly. In 1988, a scare over the presence of salmonella in eggs caused a dramatic collapse in sales. Then junior health minister Edwina Currie said most egg production in Britain was infected with salmonella. Her comments provoked outrage in the farming industry and she was forced to resign two weeks later. Two million chickens were slaughtered and the Government had to offer a compensation package of millions of pounds to farmers. By early 1989, the link between eggs and salmonella poisoning was proved beyond doubt and pregnant woman were told to avoid under-cooked eggs. FSA chairwoman Heather Hancock said the watchdog had ""thoroughly reviewed"" the new scientific evidence following improvements in animal welfare and a vaccination programme and was ""confident"" about relaxing its rules. ""The major reduction in the risk of salmonella in Lion eggs is testament to the work carried out by egg producers,"" she said. ""The measures they've taken, from vaccination of hens through to improving hygiene on farms and bettertransportation, have dramatically reduced salmonella levels in UK hens."" The revised advice does not apply to people with impaired immune systems whose diets are supervised by health professionals."
2017-10-11,"A Tory minister has risked reopening the so-called ""dementia tax"" row by claiming taxpayers ""shouldn't necessarily be propping up people to keep their property"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/tory-minister-jackie-doyle-price-risks-reopening-dementia-tax-row-11076868,"Jackie Doyle-Price, the Government's care minister, suggested homes ""shouldn't be seen"" by people as ""an asset to give to their offspring"" as she addressed the issue of social care funding. In video footage to emerge from a fringe event at last week's Conservative Party conference, the Thurrock MP said: ""The reality is that the taxpayer shouldn't necessarily be propping up people to keep their property and hand it on to their children when they're generating massive care needs."" She later added the Tories will be ""very much looking at… the whole issue of caps and floors"", with the Government set to consult on changes to the social care system. Speaking of the current system being ""unfair"" on taxpayers, Ms Doyle-Price went on: ""People are now well into their pension ages sitting in homes that really are too big for their needs and we do need to start having those conversations about what's appropriate earlier."" In the Conservative manifesto ahead of June's General Election, the party said they would take into account the value of a person's home when means-testing care funding. Although the party promised to protect £100,000 of a person's wealth critics soon dubbed the proposed policy a ""dementia tax"", as those facing expensive care could face huge costs. Amid the backlash, Theresa May was forced to announce an unspecified cap would be introduced on care costs, although many blamed the row for derailing the Tory campaign ahead of an election which cost the party their House of Commons majority. The controversial plans appeared to have been sidelined when the Queen's Speech included merely a commitment to ""improve"" social care funding, but stopped short of specific proposals ahead of a consultation. Responding to Ms Doyle-Price's comments, a Downing Street spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: ""We clearly recognise that there is an imbalance in the current system with the way people's assets are treated depending on whether they need domiciliary care or not, but as a party we want to be able to promote people passing on property to their children as much as possible. ""We are looking at social care as a long-term challenge and we will publish a green paper in due course."" Labour accused Ms Doyle-Price of reviving the so-called ""dementia tax"" row. ""The idea of a 'dementia tax' was rightly rejected by the public during the General Election,"" said party leader Jeremy Corbyn. ""It can't be right that if you have a heart condition you're treated on the NHS but if you have dementia you have to pay with your home."""

2017-10-11,There's been an unpleasant crumpling of paper and packaging shares following a profits warning from Mondi.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/mondi-profit-warning-sees-shares-in-paper-and-packaging-firm-crumple-11076462,"You may not have heard of this company but, courtesy of its membership of the FTSE 100, the chances are that you will indirectly own shares in it via tracker funds held by your life policy, pension fund or ISA. For Mondi is a business with a stock market value - even after the latest profit alert - of £10bn. And while its origins are in South Africa and its corporate headquarters are in Vienna, it operates out of no fewer than 40 locations in the UK, including manufacturing sites at Deeside, North Wales, Nelson in Lancashire and Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. It used to be bigger still in Britain, having until 2012 owned the newsprint supplier Aylesford, whose paper was used by titles including The Times, the Daily Mirror and The Observer. Previously part of Anglo American, the international mining giant, it was spun off as a separate business as its own right in 2007 and has spent most of the intervening period in the FTSE 100. It has not been a bad investment, either, with the shares delivering a 322% return during that period compared with one of just 20% from the FTSE All Share index. This has been bolstered by rapid growth in recent years following acquisitions in a number of countries and, in particular, emerging markets in Asia and central and Eastern Europe. During the last four years alone, Mondi has spent €1.6bn (£1.4bn) on acquisitions, with more deals promised. These, in theory, should be boom times for Mondi. Paper and packaging sounds relatively unglamorous as a business activity yet, as globalisation swells the ranks of the middle classes in markets like India and Turkey, more people are buying more things - and that means more paper and packaging. The rise of e-commerce in developed markets, meanwhile, has also created a demand for packaging. Accordingly, the company has grown full year operating profits from €547m in 2012 to €943m last year, with sales also rising solidly in that time. So what appears to have gone wrong now? Well, a couple of things. Firstly, the company has been caught out by currency issues, chiefly the US dollar - the weakest-performing major currency this year - and a fall in the Turkish lira. At the same time, input costs have also bitten, with Mondi citing higher wood, energy and chemical costs than in the same period last year. The price of recycled paper, which is being demanded by increasing numbers of customers for environmental reasons, was up 15% during the third quarter of the year from the corresponding period a year ago. There have also been closures, for maintenance, of some of the company's paper mills. The company added: ""Continuing cost pressures and negative currency impacts are expected to result in an underlying performance for the year modestly below market expectations."" That has been enough to send shares of Mondi down by nearly 8% and also drag down shares of other packaging firms, including Smurfit Kappa, the Irish packaging giant which is also in the FTSE 100 and DS Smith, the British group that sits just outside the index. Should investors panic? Probably not. Yes, sentiment in companies like this is always going to be influenced by short-term currency fluctuations and short-term price movements that - as has been seen - can blow profitability off-course for one or two quarters. Yet this is a company that, for many years, has enjoyed industry-beating returns and which is operating in an industry in which big is beautiful and which is consolidating. It is also operating in a sector where, as DS Smith has shown, innovation is prized by customers. Mondi recently bought Excelsior, a British business that has a reputation for coming up with bright ideas in food packaging, an area in which Mondi has previously not had much of a presence - but in which, with its strong global distribution, it could easily roll out innovative products and gain market share quickly. Those investors of a short-term persuasion may well have thrown their share certificates in the waste-paper basket. Others taking a longer-term view will keep them on their desk under the paper-weight."

Discussing a no-deal Brexit, Mr Bruton warned on All Out Politics: ""The effects in Ireland would be devastating for the peace process. ""I spent a lot of my life building a reconciliation that enabled a peace process in Northern Ireland to be put in place. ""That's going to be utterly disrupted by the barriers that will have to be imposed along the border if Britain leaves the European Union without a satisfactory deal."" :: Chancellor 'won't budget for no deal Brexit' Dublin, London and Brussels say they agree on wanting to maintain a ""soft"" or ""frictionless"" border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, even if the UK leaves the customs union. However, the European Union maintains not enough progress has been made in this particular area. And a leaked report from the Irish authorities on Sunday concluded that an open border will be impossible from a customs perspective. The UK released fresh policy papers on Monday which outlined how the UK would handle customs and trade arrangements if it failed to reach a trade deal with Brussels, raising the prospect of a no-deal exit. Mr. Bruton went on to urge the British government to change its approach and ask for a six-year negotiating period while remaining in the EU. He claimed the country is not ready to make the compromises necessary to reach a deal in the two-year Article 50 process which ends in March 2019. Mr Bruton also warned of ""enormous"" job losses and delays at borders if a trade agreement is not reached. ""Most of the cheddar that you eat in Britain is produced in Ireland,"" he said. ""If that had to bear a very heavy tariff, or if many of the food industry exports from Britain to Ireland had to bear a very heavy tariff, the disruption would be enormous, the delays would be enormous, the loss of jobs would be enormous. ""All of this could perhaps be avoided if we just took a little bit more time to do the deal in a rational way rather than in accordance with an unduly tight timetable which was put in place on the assumption that something like Brexit would not actually happen."""

At that point, those directly affected by the 14 June tragedy will be able to apply for permanent residency. The move is an extension of the Government's initial offer to Grenfell survivors in the immediate aftermath of the fire, when those with unsettled immigration status were given 12 months leave to remain in the UK. In a written statement to Parliament, immigration minister Brandon Lewis revealed the new offer has been designed following consultation with residents and Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the former court of appeal judge in charge of the Grenfell Tower inquiry. Mr Lewis said: ""Our initial response to this terrible tragedy was rightly focused on survivors' immediate needs in the aftermath of the fire and ensuring they could access the services they need to start to rebuild their lives. ""However, since the Grenfell Tower immigration policy was announced, we have been planning for the future of those residents affected by these unprecedented events and listening to their feedback, as well as the views of Sir Martin Moore-Bick. ""The Government believes it is right to provide this specific group of survivors greater certainty over their long-term future in the UK, subject to their continued eligibility and the necessary security and criminality checks being met. ""Eligible survivors granted the initial 12 months' leave outside the Immigration Rules will be able to apply for further periods of limited leave with access to public funds and permission to work, and indefinite leave to remain after five years' lawful residence."" The Home Office also announced those relatives of survivors or victims of the fire who have already been granted entry to the UK in the wake of the tragedy - in order to provide support or to arrange funerals - will be able to stay for up to six months from their date of entry. Those who believe they are eligible for the extended immigration schemes have until 30 November to come forward to officials, with a specialist Home Office team currently based near to Grenfell Tower. Volunteers working with survivors have previously said concerns about their immigration status were preventing some from seeking assistance. Later on Wednesday, Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid revealed Kensington Council hopes to have all former Grenfell residents moved out of emergency hotel accommodation by Christmas, unless they want to stay. Mr Javid told MPs on the House of Commons' Communities Select Committee there were 203 households from the tower and neighbouring properties in need of rehousing after the fire. Of these, 92 are yet to be found new homes, many of whom are living in hotels, Mr Javid said."

He denies murdering Elsie at the home he shared with husband Craig Scully-Hicks, in Llandaff, Cardiff. The couple moved to the property the month before the youngster died, Cardiff Crown Court was told, having previously lived in the Fairwater area of the city. Susan Bevan, who lived next door to the couple in Fairwater, told the jury: ""I would hear her (Elsie) crying. ""On one occasion he was frustrated, saying 'Shut up, shut up, shut up'. It would be 'Shut the f*** up' sometimes. ""It appeared to be exasperated, frustrated - as you would if a baby had been crying a lot."" She said she had called Matthew Scully-Hicks ""the one who stayed at home"" while she referred to his husband as ""the one who went to work"". The court was previously told that Scully-Hicks had stopped working full-time to care for Elsie. Mrs Bevan added: ""I do remember one occasion where the baby was crying a lot and, from a mother's point of view, it sounded like a proper cry. ""He said 'Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up'. I remember thinking 'That sounds like a colicky pain, I don't think he realises the baby is in pain'."" She added that she never heard the sound of a child being hit, or screaming out, and had ""no reason"" to be worried about Elsie. Mrs Bevan's son, James, told the court he could hear some of what was going on through his bedroom wall. He said: ""I heard a contained tantrum - it was like 'argh'. It was an adult's voice, followed by the baby crying. As the baby was still crying I would hear the door slam."" He added that on one occasion between February and April 2016: ""The baby was crying. I heard the one who stayed at home shout 'Shut up, you little f****** brat'."" Mr Bevan said he then heard loud music that played for one song, before the sound of the baby crying again. After which: ""The one who stayed at home repeatedly said 'Shut up, shut up, shut up' over and over again."" He said he had heard similar incidents ""maybe once a week"" but that only the two he described stuck in his mind. Elsie was removed from her natural mother within days of her birth in November 2014. She went to live with the Matthew and Craig Scully-Hicks in September 2015 and was formally adopted by the couple two weeks before she died. A 27-minute-long emergency call from Matthew Scully-Hicks made on 25 May 2016 was played to the jury. He was heard saying: ""Elsie, Elsie, come on, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake, babe, come on."" Matthew Scully-Hicks claimed Elsie had fallen down the stairs after a wooden stair gate accidentally opened when she pulled herself up on it. Examinations at the hospital found Elsie had suffered bleeding on both sides of her brain. A post-mortem revealed she had also suffered several broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. She died at the hospital on 29 May. The trial continues."

But if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win."" The strained relationship between the President and America's top diplomat became public last week when NBC reported Vice President Mike Pence had to persuade Mr Tillerson not to quit during the summer and that Mr Tillerson had called the President a ""moron"". The former oil executive told reporters he had never considered resigning, but refused to address the reported insult. He said he wouldn't dignify ""petty nonsense"" and insisted he remained committed to the administration's foreign policy goals. Mr Tillerson's spokeswoman later said he never used such language. But the President's frequent interventions into Mr Tillerson's area have left many wondering how long his commitment will last. Mr Trump recently told his top diplomat he was wasting his time trying to reach a negotiated settlement with North Korea, something Mr Trump's incendiary tweets have rendered unlikely anyway. He has also given to his son-in-law Jared Kushner the task of leading the administration's efforts towards a Middle East peace deal, traditionally one of any Secretary of State's key areas of influence. But far from weakening Mr Tillerson, Mr Trump told Forbes he was being supportive. ""I'm not undermining... I think I'm actually strengthening authority,"" he said. The pair are scheduled to have lunch on Tuesday at the White House with Defence Secretary James Mattis."

Appearing before MPs at the House of Commons' Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday, Mr Hammond raised the prospect of no air traffic agreement being struck if Brexit talks collapse - although he suggested ""mutual self-interest"" would see flights continue. ""It is theoretically conceivable in a no-deal scenario there will be no air traffic moving between the UK and EU on 29 March, 2019,"" the Chancellor said. ""But I don't think anybody seriously believes that is where we will get to."" Mr Hammond spoke as he was quizzed over whether the Treasury will authorise spending to enable Whitehall departments to prepare for Britain leaving the EU without a departure deal. He said the Government will need to ""determine what is a realistic worse case scenario that we need to plan for and invest for"". But, on the prospect of a no deal outcome affecting airlines, Mr Hammond added: ""On that specific point, it's very clear that mutual self-interest means that even if talks break down, even if there is no deal, there will be a very strong compulsion on both sides to reach agreement on an air traffic services arrangement."" Mr Hammond also used his committee appearance to send a message, likely aimed at disgruntled Brexiteers, that no contingency cash to prepare for a no deal Brexit would be committed ""earlier than necessary just to make some point"". But the Chancellor failed to confirm reports that next month's Autumn budget will not include funds for a no-deal Brexit. ""The point I was making is that we do have planning for all scenarios including a no-deal scenario,"" he added. Pushed for when the Government would have to start spending by to mitigate a no-deal fallout, Mr Hammond said spending would have to begin in early 2018. He also admitted that crashing out of the EU without a deal was ""sub-optimal"". :: No-deal Brexit would be 'devastating' for Ireland Ramping up the threat that talks could fail, the Chancellor warned that the UK should brace for a ""bad-tempered breakdown in negotiations"". And challenged over concerns in the financial sector, the Chancellor claimed ""certainty itself"" was better than ""getting the perfect outcome"". He also revealed £250m had already been earmarked for some departments to work on a no-deal scenario. Later, Theresa May announced in PMQs the money will be spread between the Home Office, HMRC, Department for International Trade and DEFRA. Mr Hammond's comments came as a new Sky Data poll revealed nearly three-quarters (74%) support the Government's position that no deal is better than a bad deal on Brexit. Out of 1,023 respondents, only 26% said they believed any deal with the EU is better than no deal. Treasury committee member and Labour MP Wes Streeting said Mr Hammond had admitted that ""spending money preparing for a damaging no-deal Brexit will leave our crumbling public services short of funds"". He added: ""Philip Hammond's heart isn't in this because he, unlike many in his party, at least recognises the terrible risks and pitfalls Brexit has left this country vulnerable to."" :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1023 Sky customers by SMS on 11 October 2017.

It comes amid claims Weinstein raped three women and admitted groping a model in a recording obtained by The New Yorker magazine. :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's casting couch Hollywood stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie have also accused the movie producer of making unwanted advances towards them. Weinstein continues to ""unequivocally deny"" allegations of non-consensual sex against him, and of illegal sexual harassment. In a statement, his wife told People magazine: ""I have chosen to leave my husband. ""Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time."" :: Weinstein: Accusers, critics and defenders The couple married in 2007 and have two children together - India Pearl, seven, and four-year-old Dashiell Max Robert. On Wednesday, Culture Secretary Karen Bradley told Sky News the question of whether Weinstein should be stripped of his CBE, awarded in 2004 for services to the British film industry, was a matter for the Honours Committee. She said the allegations against the film producer were ""chilling"" and ""very disturbing"". Former US president Barack Obama said he and his wife Michelle were left ""disgusted"" by the allegations against Weinstein, who has been a major donor to the Democratic Party since the early 1990s. The claims come as The New Yorker alleged Asia Argento, an Italian actress, told the magazine Weinstein forcibly performed a sex act on her. She and two other women also allege that Weinstein raped them, The New Yorker claimed. Meanwhile, a police recording has emerged purporting to be of Weinstein trying to persuade an Italian model to enter his hotel room. The recording, said to be made by New York Police Department, apparently features a conversation between the film producer and Ambra Battilana Gutierrez at the entrance to his hotel room. Gutierrez is heard telling Weinstein clearly she is ""not comfortable"" with the situation as he tells her repeatedly to come and sit next to him and to go to the bathroom after saying he is going to have a shower. Towards the end of the recording, Gutierrez asks Weinstein: ""Why yesterday you touch my breast?"", to which he responds: ""Oh, please, I'm sorry, just come on in. I'm used to that. Come on. Please."" Gutierrez responds: ""You're used to that?"" to which Weinstein says: ""Yes, come in."" She then tells him: ""No, but I'm not used to that,"" to which he replies: ""I won't do it again, come on, sit here."" When she says it's ""too much"" for her, he tells her: ""Please, you're making a big scene,"" before, when she still will not submit, saying: ""Okay. Bye. Thank you."" Manhattan District Attorney's office said the recording was arranged by the NYPD in 2015 without its input and as a result its prosecutors were not able to discuss with investigators what was necessary to capture to prove a sex crime. In his latest statement, Weinstein denied ""there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances"". The multiple Oscar winner had taken a voluntary leave of absence from the Weinstein Company after the harassment allegations were detailed in The New York Times last week."

Between 1975 and 2016 the estimated number of obese boys in the world increased from six million to 74 million. For girls figures rose from five million to 50 million. Professor Majid Ezzati from Imperial College London, whose team contributed to the research, told Sky News: ""Whilst there have been some initiatives led by governments, communities and schools to raise awareness about child and adolescent obesity, most high income countries have been reluctant to use taxes and industry regulations to change eating and drinking behaviours to tackle child obesity."" It is mainly developing countries that have seen a rise in obesity levels. In Europe and the United States, figures have plateaued. Nonetheless, a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) suggests childhood obesity is still growing in the poorest communities in the UK, with one in 10 young people now classed as obese in this country. In cities like Bristol, healthy schools programmes have been introduced. At Hillcrest Primary pupils are taught about the importance of a balanced diet and keeping active. But with increasing pressures, particularly on young girls, to conform to certain stereotypes, teachers say it's all about striking the right balance. Deputy Head, Bridget Norman said: ""I think children, no matter what age, are always thinking about their appearance and how they look but I think so long as we focus on the positive side, about healthiness, rather than the vanity side then it's ok."" In PE lessons at Hillcrest children said they did not like the idea of being plump or fat and so exercise was important to them, as was limiting sugary treats. There is now mounting pressure on the government to take action against big sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks brands, who spend more than £140m on advertising each year. The government itself is only able to spend a fraction of that on promoting healthy eating campaigns. The WHO also recommends that countries introduce taxes on sugary drinks, as well as clear packaging labels and a ban on unhealthy snacks that are often provided in schools. There is a concern that younger generations are obsessed not only with smart phones and computer screens, but also sugar. Many believe that could cripple the NHS in the years to come and damage the health of future generations. Dr Alison Tedstone, Chief Nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ""It's taken many years for us to reach this point and change will not happen overnight.

The ship suffered damage to its side after colliding with the Liberian-flagged Alnic MC in the early hours, but sailed under its own power and arrived at the Changi naval base in Singapore with a large hole torn in its hull. The Pacific-based US Seventh Fleet confirmed commanding officer Alfredo J Sanchez and executive officer Jessie L Sanchez were ""relieved of their duties"" on Wednesday. ""Both were relieved due to a loss of confidence,"" it said in a statement. The two commanders have since been reassigned to other duties in Japan. The latest move comes after the US Navy fired the-then commander of the Japan-based Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, following the August crash. The incident came after another destroyer, the USS Fitzgerald, collided with a Philippines-flagged cargo ship off Japan in June, which left seven sailors dead. Two other non-fatal incidents have also taken place this year, with the USS Antietam running aground near its base in Japan in January and the USS Lake Champlain colliding with a South Korean fishing vessel in May. Several other officers and sailors have also been relieved of duty or reprimanded following the USS McCain crash. In its statement, the US Seventh Fleet insisted the incident was ""preventable"". It said: ""While the investigation is ongoing, it is evident the collision was preventable, the commanding officer exercised poor judgement, and the executive officer exercised poor leadership of the ship's training programme."" Some Navy officials have put the collision down to strains from regular extended deployments, delayed maintenance and budget constraints, including reductions in resources devoted to training. In the aftermath of the collision, the chief of the US Navy, Admiral John Richardson, said there was no indication the collision was intentional but an examination would include a full analysis of the vessel's cybersecurity. He added: ""I have directed an operational pause be taken in all of our fleets around the world."""
2017-10-11,The Prime Minster has decided to go for it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-accelerates-into-brexit-tidal-wave-11074461,"A little like a captain of a ship facing a tidal wave, and realising the only way through is to accelerate into it. As expected, that meant the publication of outline plans for what No Deal would mean to our customs and trade system. This matters to Brexiteer ultras, but the more telling matter was that no money has been set aside, no land bought, no customs officers employed. It is a paper trade designed, by talking about No Deal, to avoid it ever happening. The Government did not sign up to the views of its former or current Cabinet ministers that No Deal would be perfectly fine. Instead, the PM did something really quite unexpected. She told Jacob Rees-Mogg, to his face, on the floor of the Commons that, yes, the European Court of Justice would be maintaining its jurisdiction during the transition phase. Officially, that is, until an alternative dispute resolution mechanism (an EFTA-type court for UK-EU) can be negotiated. In practice this will take at least two years. This may well have been the obvious implication of Mrs May's Florence speech, but it was not clearly stated, and the PM did not, for example, choose to clarify the same point in her Sky News interview last week. On Monday she did, choosing to dispense with the fudge, clear the fog, and try to get down to actual business. Mr Rees-Mogg was ""concerned"" and told Sky News that the PM had gone ""further than I wished her to go on ECJ jurisdiction during transition"". Bill Cash said MPs were keen to study the detail. Other Brexiteers said they were ""relaxed"" and could stomach the ECJ for another ""two years"". But this clearly crossed the private red lines of some Cabinet ministers, and the public ones expressed just before the Tory conference by Boris Johnson. No matter, the Foreign Secretary was soon to be found agreeing with the PM entirely on transition and agreeing with Michael Gove that the focus should be on the end state. Indeed Number 10 advisers say they have managed to convince all but a handful of MPs that she needs to focus all her ""negotiating capital not on a transition but on the end state"". It has, for now, worked. The PM has carried her Cabinet towards a position supporting a multi-year transition with full payments and ECJ jurisdiction. It may yet provide a few queasy moments in the Commons. The real question: will it unlock progress with the European Union? Perhaps it will create some goodwill that reaches ""sufficient progress"" by December. The question: whether her backbenchers will stomach more compromises on their pure ""clean Brexit"". So far it seems the PM calculates, as I argued last month, that her backbenchers will cash in their chips, and not risk their Brexit for No Brexit or a Corbyn Brexit. We want to save our negotiating capital for the end state."
2017-10-11,A police officer has been sacked for handcuffing and forcefully dragging a screaming nurse out of a Utah hospital.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/utah-police-officer-sacked-for-dragging-nurse-out-of-hospital-in-row-over-blood-sample-11075799,"Officers attempted to take blood from an unconscious patient at Salt Lake City University Hospital as he had been in a fatal car incident and they wanted to determine if he was intoxicated or not. But they were stopped by nurse Alex Wubbels, who said they could not get a sample without a warrant or consent from the patient. Following a dispute, detective Jeff Payne was captured on bodycam footage telling the nurse ""we're done, you're under arrest"", before roughly grabbing her and bundling her out of the door. Video shows Ms Wubbels screaming ""stop, I've done nothing wrong"" as Payne handcuffs her and pulls her to his car. Following an internal investigation, Payne was found to have broken police rules and brought his force into ""significant disrepute"". In a disciplinary letter, Salt Lake City police chief Mike Brown said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the officer's conduct, which he described as ""inappropriate, unreasonable, unwarranted, discourteous and disrespectful"". He added: ""You demonstrated extremely poor professional judgement, especially for an officer with 27 years of experience, which calls into question your ability to effectively serve the public and the department."" Payne's supervisor, who ordered the arrest of Ms Wubbels, was also demoted two ranks. Mr Brown described James Tracy as the ""catalyst that led to the arrest"" and criticised him for escalating the situation. He wrote: ""Your lack of judgment and leadership in this matter is unacceptable, and as a result, I no longer believe that you can retain a leadership position in the department."" Footage of the incident on 26 July went viral and sparked a national debate over police use of force. It led to calls for an investigation and for Salt Lake City Police Department to issue an apology to Ms Wubbels. Following the row, the nurse said Payne had ""bullied me to the utmost extreme"". She added: ""Even though it might seem like just a simple blood draw, it is not just a simple blood draw to a patient. ""If this patient cannot speak for themselves, I don't have the right to make decisions on their behalf. My choice is to defend them at all costs."""
2017-10-11,A law to protect consumers from rip-offs by energy companies - promised by Theresa May in her ill-fated Tory conference speech - is being unveiled in the Commons.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-unveils-draft-energy-cap-law-to-combat-rip-off-bills-11076798,"The legislation is aimed at cutting bills for households on a standard variable tariff, which critics claim penalises loyal customers who stay with one supplier rather than shop around. A pledge to change the law was included in the Conservative manifesto before June's General Election, but dropped from the subsequent Queen's Speech after some Tory MPs claimed it was state intervention and anti-free market. But after 192 MPs of all parties wrote to the Prime Minister in September complaining that poorer customers were being preyed on by energy firms, Mrs May revived the plan and backed a price cap. Suppliers reacted with fury as billions of pounds were wiped off the value of their shares after the Prime Minister's pledge, which came in the speech overshadowed by a P45 prank, her coughing fit and a collapsing set. The Bill putting a cap on tariffs is being published in draft and scrutinised by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee of MPs, in a move the Government says will help build a cross-party consensus. Under the draft Bill, the regulator Ofgem would bring in a price cap on the poor value tariffs that exploit customer loyalty, which would protect around two-thirds of households, according to the Government. ""I have been clear that our broken energy market has to change,"" the Prime Minister said. ""It has to offer fairer prices for millions of loyal customers who have been paying hundreds of pounds too much. ""Today's publication of draft legislation is a vital step towards fixing that, and in offering crucial peace of mind for ordinary working families all over the country."" The Competition and Markets Authority found that customers of the so-called ""Big Six"" energy suppliers on standard variable and default energy tariffs are paying £1.4bn a year more than they need. Ofgem this week announced it is extending its existing price cap for vulnerable consumers and the Government says five million households will now, for the first time, benefit from protection against rip-off energy bills this winter. Four million of those are on pre-payment meters. The regulator will, from February, protect a further one million households who receive the Warm Home Discount. The Government says it welcomes Ofgem's move, but claims the regulator could go further to protect everyone on default tariffs from the unfair practices affecting two-thirds of households in Britain. ""The energy market is broken,"" Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said. ""It punishes loyalty. The independent competition authority found millions of people who are customers of the Big Six suppliers are overpaying to the tune of £1.4bn a year. ""That is simply wrong. While five million households will see their bills capped from this winter, I want to see every household protected from rip-off bills. ""That is why we have published this draft legislation today - sending a clear message to suppliers they must act to put an end to loyal consumers being treated so unfairly."" Labour says the Government's proposed legislation does not go far enough. Chi Onwurah, the party's shadow minister for industrial strategy, science and innovation, told Sky News: ""The test of an energy price cap will be how many customers benefit by how much this winter. ""The Government dithered for so long, arguing with the energy regulator, before finally being forced to take any action that it seems unlikely consumers will really benefit. ""A Labour government would immediately introduce an emergency price cap while we transition to a fairer system for bill payers."" There has also been a guarded welcome for the draft Bill from consumer organisation Which. ""For millions of consumers worried about their energy bills, a cap might sound like a positive move,"" said Alex Neill, its managing director of home products and services. ""However, the Government must guard against any unintended consequences that undermine customer service and push up prices as a whole. ""As it will take some time to come into effect, customers sitting on expensive standard variable tariffs should switch now."""

NHS leaders have been planning for months to avoid a repeat of the near-meltdown last winter, when high demand forced A&E departments to turn patients away. Trusts have been ordered to free up additional beds by discharging more patients into community care, and a national vaccination program is planned to try to head off a flu virus that has caused a record outbreak in the Antipodes. Dr Nick Scriven, President of the SAM, said any significant flu or virus outbreak could cripple the system, and accused the Government of failing to properly fund the NHS. ""Over the last two to three years we haven't had to deal with any major outbreaks of infection such as norovirus or flu, but this year we are predicting a bad flu season that will overwhelm us after what we've witnessed in Australia and New Zealand,"" he said. ""For all the talk of preparations, on the ground it feels as though there is nothing new this year other than crossed fingers - which is fair comment as the Government has failed to tackle effectively the issues behind the pressures we face. ""If, as we expect, we see a flu outbreak, I think the NHS - in terms of both beds and clinical staff - will break far worse than last year and elective activity will almost certainly cease for several months."" The warning comes as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announces the extension of an existing Government scheme to try to recruit more GPs into areas with acute shortages, including rural and coastal communities. Mr Hunt will announce a package of measures to tackle the recruitment crisis at the Royal College of GPs annual conference in Liverpool. An existing scheme offering £20,000 ""golden hellos"" to trainee GPs will be extended into 2018 with the aim of recruiting 200 GPs in areas of most need. Mr Hunt will also announce the expansion of a ""fast-track"" programme, currently targeting doctors in Australia. The Government has pledged to recruit 5,000 doctors by 2020, but NHS England recently quadrupled its forecast for how many will have to come from abroad from 500 to 2,000. As well as Australia, doctors in New Zealand, Canada, the United States and India will be targeted. GPs considering retirement will also be offered ""flexible working arrangements"" to try to persuade them to stay in post rather than leaving and exacerbating the recruitment crisis. The British Medical Association said the measures do not go far enough. Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chair, said: ""These proposals do appear to acknowledge the specific problems facing rural areas in England. ""But 'golden hellos' are not a new idea and unlikely to solve the overall workforce crisis given we are failing badly to train enough GPs to meet current demands."""

In the manifesto, the party said the charter would ""put a responsibility on industry not to direct users - even unintentionally - to hate speech, pornography, or other sources of harm"". The strategy proposes a code of practice for social media companies which would create ""a joined-up approach to remove or address bullying, intimidating or humiliating online content"". The leading minister, Karen Bradley MP, said: ""The Internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people."" It follows the announcement of a new national police hub being set up to crack down on online abuse and trolls. It also sees through a manifesto Digital Charter pledge to create a new tax on social media companies to fund programmes raising awareness and countering ""internet harms"". The strategy also suggests a greater role for the education system in helping children use services online in a safe manner. Two new subjects would be introduced in schools, Relationship Education at primary, and Relationship and Sex Education at secondary, to provide online safety education. Confirmed in the Queen's Speech, the Digital Charter has ignited concerns from digital rights groups about the possible implications for civil liberties. In the manifesto, the party said it would also introduce a sanctions regime for companies that fail to meet their legal duties in regards to content that is deemed in breach of law. The difficulties in establishing whether content could be illegal or not were highlighted earlier this year when YouTube deleted an archive of video evidence of potential war crimes in Syria. In 2012, Twitter user Paul Chambers had his conviction overturned in the High Court after a joke threat on the messaging platform: ""Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your s*** together, otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!"" The proposed strategy is out for consultation until Thursday 7 December, and the Government said it expects to provide a response in early 2018."

The 31-year-old denies murdering the toddler at the couple's four-bedroom home in Llandaff, Cardiff. Giving evidence at Cardiff Crown Court, Craig Scully-Hicks told the jury he had never heard his husband shout at Elsie, nor her adopted sibling. ""I need to be clear here,"" he said. ""My house was filled with love and happiness. All the time. If I had suspected anything I wouldn't have tolerated it."" Wales Ambulance Service received an emergency call from Matthew Scully-Hicks at about 6.20pm on 25 May 2016. Paramedics found Elsie was not breathing, with no signs of a heartbeat, and took her to the University Hospital of Wales. She died in hospital four days later, on 29 May 2016. Prosecutors allege Matthew Scully-Hicks ""assaulted, abused and ultimately murdered"" the little girl. Examinations at the hospital found Elsie had suffered bleeding on both sides of her brain. A post-mortem revealed she had also suffered several broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. The court was told that Matthew Scully-Hicks wrote messages commenting on his adopted daughter's personality before her death. One, sent 11 days after Elsie was placed with the family, described the toddler as having had ""a proper diva strop"". In another, he allegedly called her ""a psycho"" and described her as ""Satan dressed up in a Babygro"" to his husband. The prosecution allege the messages suggest he was ""struggling to cope"". But Craig Scully-Hicks, describing the situation at home after the couple adopted Elsie, told the court she was ""great"". He added: ""She was good apart from her sleeping. She liked to nap but she liked to get up again a couple of hours later."" Neighbours allegedly heard Elsie crying and Matthew Scully-Hicks shouting ""shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up"", the court heard. On one occasion, he allegedly shouted ""shut up you little f****** brat"". Craig Scully-Hicks, who said he spent two to three days a week working away from home, said he had ""never"" heard his husband refer to Elsie in that way. Matthew Scully-Hicks denies murder. The trial continues."

But - using the Italian alias Enzo Mellonceli - he was able to evade authorities after he was bailed pending further inquiries. Police revealed the near miss as they launched a new appeal to find O'Brien - and a £50,000 reward - on the second anniversary of Mr Hanson's death. Mr Hanson's mother Tracey also spoke out - revealing she has not been able to grieve properly for her son while his alleged killer is on the loose. O'Brien, 28, was flown out of the UK on a privately chartered plane from Biggin Hill Airport shortly after Mr Hanson was killed in an unprovoked knife attack in a bar in Hillingdon, west London, on 11 October 2015. It is believed he may have spent time hiding in the Netherlands and Dubai before he was last seen when arrested in Prague. He has used a second Italian alias - Enzo Machado. Photos taken when O'Brien was held in the Czech Republic show he has grown his hair, has a full beard and has a new tattoo of an owl holding a skull, which covers up his previous identifying ""Shannon 15-04-16"" tattoo. Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh, from the Met's homicide and major crime command, said the £50,000 reward for information leading to O'Brien's arrest and conviction ""demonstrated the Met's determination"" in searching for him. He said: ""It is clear he is being helped by others to evade police and has the ability to move around without using his own identity. ""That is why we decided to offer such a large reward - I hope it will encourage someone who moves in O'Brien's circles to come forward."" He added: ""When arrested in Prague, O'Brien had boxing gloves with him. He uses gyms and will continue to do so I'm sure. ""His new tattoo is so distinctive it should stick in the mind of fellow boxers, or possibly a new partner. ""I would like to hear from the tattoo artist who covered up his original 'Shannon 15-04-06' tattoo - it would have taken several sittings."" Mr Hanson's mother Tracey said: ""These past 24 months have been a living nightmare, a nightmare that I would not wish on anyone. ""While we grieve, Shane O'Brien, the man the police would like to speak to in connection with my son's murder, has yet to be caught and we still wait for justice. ""Justice for the most heinous crime that my son had to endure and justice to ensure that innocent people are safe. ""Someone has seen him and all it takes is that one phone call to help us get justice so we can grieve in peace."" Police are warning members of the public not to approach O'Brien, originally from Ladbroke Grove, but to report any sightings immediately by calling 999. Two men - aged 24 and 29 - have so far been arrested as part of the investigation into Mr Hanson's murder on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and assisting an offender."

Ms Fairbairn attacked the failure to secure such a deal just a day after the Prime Minister used a radio interview to warn that the rights of EU citizens could ""fall away"" if Britain is forced to abandon Brexit talks with no deal. The CBI leader told her audience she stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" on the issue with the TUC and Labour's London Mayor, Sadiq Khan. She said: ""As Brexit uncertainty continues, London's bright lights must not be allowed to dim, whether by accident, delay, or design. We must not close the door on its open economy.

""After 15 months of human poker, the uncertainty facing them has become intolerable. It is a blight on the values of our nation.""

2017-10-11,Tech companies have begun investing huge amounts of money to help in the fight against extremism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/tech-firms-invest-100m-in-fight-against-terror-propaganda-11076597,"Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter are directly funding an increasing number of projects, not just online, but in local communities. Sky News has been told the investment, aimed at countering propaganda from terror groups like ISIS, currently tops more than £100m and is separate to the many millions already invested in policing and removing extremist content online. :: Amber Rudd plans tougher laws for terrorists using the internet It comes at a time of fierce criticism from politicians that the tech sector is not doing enough to deal with extremist content online. Richard Allan - Facebook's Vice President of Policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa - said their investment in counter-extremism projects was not a reaction to that criticism, but signalled a more profound shift in thinking from companies like his. ""Historically I think there was a sense that internet companies would say, 'look we're not responsible for anything that happens on our platform'. ""That has shifted… and I think that is the long-term status now. I don't think we're going to go back to the days where the internet companies say, 'not my problem'. The fact is, it's all our problem."" Facebook is investing many millions, not simply in technology to isolate and remove terrorist content, but directly funding community organisations so they can respond to extremist material with their own counter narrative. Richard Allan said a key plank of that is based around Facebook's Online Civil Courage Initiative: ""Some of the more unpleasant elements in society have learned to abuse all forms of internet services. ""What we want to do with this initiative is make sure that those who are trying to use our services to do good and counter that abuse, have the equal skills and resources. ""For us to invest in that directly, makes absolute sense."" Many internet companies are now working alongside counter-extremism experts, like those at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. The ISD is currently managing part of a multi-million pound global fund on behalf of Google, helping select worthwhile community projects in the UK to invest in. The Institute's director, Sasha Havlicek, said: ""We're very excited about this development, because for about seven years we've been saying we desperately need to equip civil society to compete proportionately and effectively with the propaganda machinery of extremist groups. ""The extremists are really sophisticated and they're very effective. They've been using all the tools in the tool kit. But on our side, on the civic side of this, we haven't, so this is an opportunity to start to do that."" For many UK based counter-extremism charities, the intervention by the tech sector is a lifeline. The Active Change Foundation, in east London, lost its Home Office funding more than a year ago. The charity's youth centre in Walthamstow and most of its programmes have closed down. But a £190,000 grant from Google has kept a few of the projects going. The charity's founder, Hanif Qadir, said the tech companies' involvement was very welcome, but that the Government should not use that as an excuse to pull investment from projects like his. ""Countering extremism is a resource intensive programme, especially if you're going to do it effectively, because you have to engage in all levels of community and that can only really be funded by the Government,"" said Mr Qadir. ""All praise to the tech companies which have stepped in. If it wasn't for Google, we'd have been finished a year ago. But it is a sticking plaster and sustained government funding is really what we need."" The funding of community projects is being matched by investment in technology advances. :: Facebook reveals plans to counter extremism Developments like Redirect send anti-extremism messaging to those searching for IS (Islamic State) on Google and YouTube. Redirect's developer, Yasmin Green, from the tech developer Jigsaw, travelled to the Middle East to interview former IS members to gain insight into the types of propaganda that hooked them in the first place. She acknowledges the risks involved in speaking directly to those who had been radicalised, but says tech companies were increasingly determined to do more to tackle extremism. ""I can tell you as a tech insider - and I've been at Google for 11 years, studying radicalisation on the internet for seven of those years, things have really changed in terms of how much the tech companies are doing to go after violent extremism. ""The resources involved in everything, from working with NGOs, to going to visit thousands of schools in many countries are intensive. ""Embarking on outreach programmes at a very local level is something very new when it comes to the responsibility that tech companies are taking to tackle extremism."" The tech sector's investment of many millions of pounds will not end the criticism from politicians, who have been particularly vocal in the wake of the recent terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. But those within the sector that Sky News has spoken to say that investment will continue to grow and that they are in the fight against extremism for the long term."

Despite still suffering from severe vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum), she looked relaxed and was showing signs of a tiny baby bump. The palace has not announced when the baby is due but it is believed Kate is less than 12 weeks pregnant. A royal aide said: ""The Duchess' condition is improving but she's still suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. She's delighted to be here tonight."" The Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry met leading figures in the mental health sector at the reception, including Mind president and comic Stephen Fry. At an event earlier in the day, Prince William explained in a speech that it was his wife who first decided the trio should join together to focus on mental health. William said: ""It was Catherine who first realised that all three of us were working on mental health in our individual areas of focus. ""She had seen that at the core of adult issues like addiction and family breakdown, unresolved childhood mental health issues were often part of the problem. ""Harry had seen that it wasn't enough to help veterans recover from their physical injuries without acknowledging the emotional and mental support they required. ""And after years of working with the homeless, and having been called out to multiple scenes of suicide as a search and rescue and then HEMS (helicopter emergency medical services) pilot, I understood the damage poor mental health was causing to our communities and for our families."" The Duchess has not been seen in public since 30 August, when she joined William and Harry at an event to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of Princess Diana. The couple were forced to announce that they were expecting their third child when she had to cancel a public appearance on 4 September due to sickness. Kate also suffered from the condition when she was expecting Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Normal morning sickness affects about 70% of pregnant women and causes some degree of vomiting and discomfort normally in the first trimester (12 weeks) of pregnancy, but those suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum can be constantly sick throughout the day. So far, no further royal engagements have been announced for the Duchess of Cambridge and its understood this appearance does not mean she will be resuming full royal duties just yet."
2017-10-11,A gang has been jailed after using mopeds to carry out more than 100 robberies in less than three weeks - with their victims including former chancellor George Osborne.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171012045654/http://news.sky.com/story/teen-moped-gang-jailed-for-100-robberies-in-less-than-three-weeks-11076766,"The three teenagers and a 40-year-old man - who handled the stolen goods - were sentenced to a total of more than 18 years. Their rampage, between 18 April and 5 May this year, targeted areas of London including Camden, Westminster, Chelsea and Islington. Toward the end of their spree, the gang went armed as they searched for victims and some victims were threatened with a hammer and a metal bar. Claude Parkinson, 18, and two boys aged 15 and 16 - who cannot be named - sold their loot to Shamsul Chowdhury. A raid on his home found dozens of mobile phones and a list of 327 items he had received - values listed next to them totalled £52,150. The gang had even attempted to steal the phone of former chancellor Gerorge Osborne and narrowly missed running him over, Southwark Crown Court heard. Judge David Tomlinson said the ""prolific moped-enabled crimes"" were similar to ""professional organised robbery"" and involved a ""significant degree of planning"". ""By using mopeds you were able to commit multiple offences, which you could not have if you had simply been out and about on foot,"" he told them. After the gang were caught, police reported a 40% drop in similar offences. The arrests came after someone took a photo of the gang on their bikes which revealed identifying marks that included a chipped fingernail. Parkinson, 18, was sentenced to five years and three months. The other two boys got four years and two months each, while Chowdhury was handed a sentence of four years and 10 months."
2017-10-12,There's been an unpleasant crumpling of paper and packaging shares following a profits warning from Mondi.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171013053528/http://news.sky.com/story/mondi-profit-warning-sees-shares-in-paper-and-packaging-firm-crumple-11076462,"You may not have heard of this company but, courtesy of its membership of the FTSE 100, the chances are that you will indirectly own shares in it via tracker funds held by your life policy, pension fund or ISA. For Mondi is a business with a stock market value - even after the latest profit alert - of £10bn. And while its origins are in South Africa and its corporate headquarters are in Vienna, it operates out of no fewer than 40 locations in the UK, including manufacturing sites at Deeside, North Wales, Nelson in Lancashire and Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. It used to be bigger still in Britain, having until 2012 owned the newsprint supplier Aylesford, whose paper was used by titles including The Times, the Daily Mirror and The Observer. Previously part of Anglo American, the international mining giant, it was spun off as a separate business as its own right in 2007 and has spent most of the intervening period in the FTSE 100. It has not been a bad investment, either, with the shares delivering a 322% return during that period compared with one of just 20% from the FTSE All Share index. This has been bolstered by rapid growth in recent years following acquisitions in a number of countries and, in particular, emerging markets in Asia and central and Eastern Europe. During the last four years alone, Mondi has spent €1.6bn (£1.4bn) on acquisitions, with more deals promised. These, in theory, should be boom times for Mondi. Paper and packaging sounds relatively unglamorous as a business activity yet, as globalisation swells the ranks of the middle classes in markets like India and Turkey, more people are buying more things - and that means more paper and packaging. The rise of e-commerce in developed markets, meanwhile, has also created a demand for packaging. Accordingly, the company has grown full year operating profits from €547m in 2012 to €943m last year, with sales also rising solidly in that time. So what appears to have gone wrong now? Well, a couple of things. Firstly, the company has been caught out by currency issues, chiefly the US dollar - the weakest-performing major currency this year - and a fall in the Turkish lira. At the same time, input costs have also bitten, with Mondi citing higher wood, energy and chemical costs than in the same period last year. The price of recycled paper, which is being demanded by increasing numbers of customers for environmental reasons, was up 15% during the third quarter of the year from the corresponding period a year ago. There have also been closures, for maintenance, of some of the company's paper mills. The company added: ""Continuing cost pressures and negative currency impacts are expected to result in an underlying performance for the year modestly below market expectations."" That has been enough to send shares of Mondi down by nearly 8% and also drag down shares of other packaging firms, including Smurfit Kappa, the Irish packaging giant which is also in the FTSE 100 and DS Smith, the British group that sits just outside the index. Should investors panic? Probably not. Yes, sentiment in companies like this is always going to be influenced by short-term currency fluctuations and short-term price movements that - as has been seen - can blow profitability off-course for one or two quarters. Yet this is a company that, for many years, has enjoyed industry-beating returns and which is operating in an industry in which big is beautiful and which is consolidating. It is also operating in a sector where, as DS Smith has shown, innovation is prized by customers. Mondi recently bought Excelsior, a British business that has a reputation for coming up with bright ideas in food packaging, an area in which Mondi has previously not had much of a presence - but in which, with its strong global distribution, it could easily roll out innovative products and gain market share quickly. Those investors of a short-term persuasion may well have thrown their share certificates in the waste-paper basket. Others taking a longer-term view will keep them on their desk under the paper-weight."

Although he did not comment specifically on the case, Mr Fallon spoke generally about those who choose to fight for the terror group. ""You've made yourself a legitimate target,"" he said. ""You run the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile."" Mr Fallon also stressed that IS was preparing and inspiring terror attacks in the UK. CIA chiefs reportedly confirmed to the UK government that Jones had been killed in June, according to The Sun, but it is understood the news was not made public over fears her 12-year-old son, Jojo, also died in the blast. Sky's defence correspondent Alistair Bunkall said: ""UK defence sources have told Sky News they believe the strike was successful but question some of the detail being reported in the media. ""The UK and US military has been working closely together on a number of high-profile targets in recent months and Jones is believed to have been on that list."" Jones became known as the White Widow after her British jihadist husband Junaid Hussain was killed in a US drone strike in August 2015. Before fleeing to Syria, computer hacker Hussain admitted publishing Tony Blair's address in 2011 and was jailed for six months after making hoax calls to a UK counter-terror hotline a year later. In an exclusive report in 2015, Sky News revealed the couple used online messaging services to urge British would-be recruits to carry out ""lone wolf"" attacks in the UK. Following her husband's death, Jones was reportedly placed in charge of the female wing of IS' Anwar al-Awlaki batallion - a foreign fighter unit formed with the purpose of planning and executing attacks in the West. The 50-year-old used her Twitter account to recruit women and shared pictures of herself with weapons. Major General Chip Chapman, the former MoD head of counter terror, told Sky News Jones was a ""significant"" target for the US and UK."
2017-10-12,The Prime Minster has decided to go for it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171013053528/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-accelerates-into-brexit-tidal-wave-11074461,"A little like a captain of a ship facing a tidal wave, and realising the only way through is to accelerate into it. As expected, that meant the publication of outline plans for what No Deal would mean to our customs and trade system. This matters to Brexiteer ultras, but the more telling matter was that no money has been set aside, no land bought, no customs officers employed. It is a paper trade designed, by talking about No Deal, to avoid it ever happening. The Government did not sign up to the views of its former or current Cabinet ministers that No Deal would be perfectly fine. Instead, the PM did something really quite unexpected. She told Jacob Rees-Mogg, to his face, on the floor of the Commons that, yes, the European Court of Justice would be maintaining its jurisdiction during the transition phase. Officially, that is, until an alternative dispute resolution mechanism (an EFTA-type court for UK-EU) can be negotiated. In practice this will take at least two years. This may well have been the obvious implication of Mrs May's Florence speech, but it was not clearly stated, and the PM did not, for example, choose to clarify the same point in her Sky News interview last week. On Monday she did, choosing to dispense with the fudge, clear the fog, and try to get down to actual business. Mr Rees-Mogg was ""concerned"" and told Sky News that the PM had gone ""further than I wished her to go on ECJ jurisdiction during transition"". Bill Cash said MPs were keen to study the detail. Other Brexiteers said they were ""relaxed"" and could stomach the ECJ for another ""two years"". But this clearly crossed the private red lines of some Cabinet ministers, and the public ones expressed just before the Tory conference by Boris Johnson. No matter, the Foreign Secretary was soon to be found agreeing with the PM entirely on transition and agreeing with Michael Gove that the focus should be on the end state. Indeed Number 10 advisers say they have managed to convince all but a handful of MPs that she needs to focus all her ""negotiating capital not on a transition but on the end state"". It has, for now, worked. The PM has carried her Cabinet towards a position supporting a multi-year transition with full payments and ECJ jurisdiction. It may yet provide a few queasy moments in the Commons. The real question: will it unlock progress with the European Union? Perhaps it will create some goodwill that reaches ""sufficient progress"" by December. The question: whether her backbenchers will stomach more compromises on their pure ""clean Brexit"". So far it seems the PM calculates, as I argued last month, that her backbenchers will cash in their chips, and not risk their Brexit for No Brexit or a Corbyn Brexit. We want to save our negotiating capital for the end state."

The Queen will stand with the Duke of Edinburgh on a Foreign Office balcony to observe the service. As head of the armed forces, Remembrance Sunday is seen as a significant event in the Queen's royal diary. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman added: ""The Queen wishes to be alongside the Duke of Edinburgh and he will be in the balcony."" The Palace also confirmed to Sky News that it is not the first time the Queen has not placed a wreath on Remembrance Sunday. She missed the event while she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, and when she has been overseas on tours. It has also been announced that Prince Philip's equerry will lay his wreath. It was announced in May that the Duke was retiring from public duties, but the palace said he would still appear alongside the Queen for some engagements. Buckingham Palace said this year's arrangements may not necessarily be the same for next year's service. On Tuesday, the Queen flew back from Scotland after spending the summer in Balmoral. A spokeswoman said her diary is almost exactly the same pace as at this time last year. She has already handed some official duties to younger members of the family, as three generations are now full-time working royals The Queen also no longer carries out overseas tours."
2017-10-12,Police in the UK are investigating an allegation of sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171013053528/http://news.sky.com/story/british-police-investigate-weinstein-assault-claim-11077799,"The Met Police's investigation into the alleged sexual assault, which is said to have taken place in London in the 1980s, comes after police in New York reopened a 2004 case involving the Hollywood film producer. The UK claim was reported on Wednesday morning to Merseyside Police, who referred it to Scotland Yard. A Met spokesman said it would be assessed by the force's child abuse and sexual offences command. :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood casting couch In the US, an allegation published in the New Yorker was made by former aspiring actress Lucia Evans, who said Weinstein forced her to perform a sex act on him at his Miramax offices in 2004. NYPD detectives are also reviewing public allegations against Weinstein to identify, locate and interview any possible complainants or witnesses. A flood of sexual harassment, assault and rape claims has surfaced against the producer following a report in The New York Times alleging a history of abusive behaviour dating back decades. A police recording was also published in the New Yorker in which Weinstein appeared to admit to groping Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. :: Harvey Weinstein - Accusers, critics and defenders While prosecutors have said they were ""sickened"" by the recording, they claimed there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction. British actress Kate Beckinsale is the latest woman to speak out against Weinstein, calling him ""an emblem of a system that is sick"". Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Lea Seydoux and Cara Delevingne are among a growing chorus of high-profile women who have accused the producer of sexual harassment or assault. Jane Fonda said she should have spoken out last year when another actress - who has since gone public - told her about sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein. The media mogul has previously denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. When approached outside his daughter's home in Los Angeles, Weinstein told photographers: ""I'm not doing okay, I'm trying - gotta get help. You know what? We all make mistakes."" He is now understood to be undergoing rehabilitation in Arizona for sex addiction. Following the scandal, the producer has been fired from his own company and left by his wife, British designer Georgina Chapman. Bafta - the British Academy of Film and Television Arts - has suspended his membership, while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences - which hosts the Oscars - is to hold a meeting on Saturday to discuss whether to suspend him."
2017-10-12,"The number of workers on low pay in the UK has fallen by more than 300,000 following the introduction of the national living wage, a think tank says.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171013053528/http://news.sky.com/story/biggest-fall-in-low-pay-in-four-decades-resolution-foundation-11076967,"According to the Resolution Foundation, this is the biggest year-on-year fall in low pay since 1977 - with its report claiming the national living wage has not been the ""jobs-killing disaster"" some feared. The share of workers on low pay has fallen below 20% for the first time since the 1980s, with low pay defined as less than two-thirds the median hourly wage. Despite record employment levels, the foundation says there is still more work to be done. Its report has warned that the UK remains too reliant on low-paid jobs - and 61% of workers in these positions are women. Conor D'Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""While it's important to celebrate the national living wage as a bold, positive policy action, we shouldn't get complacent. ""As well as the challenges it presents to some employers, over four million workers are still expected to be in low pay by 2020, and the old problems of women and part-time workers being far more likely to be low paid than men remain. ""The Government must continue to work closely with employers to monitor any specific challenges arising from the ramping up of the national living wage, as well as continuing to tackle illegal non-payment."" The national living wage was introduced by the Government in April last year to warnings from many business groups that some sectors - particularly retail - could not afford it and productivity would be hit. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility agreed job losses were a risk as ministers moved to tighten minimum pay rules with then chancellor George Osborne saying at the time: ""Britain deserves a pay rise."" The starting rate for everyone over the age of 25 was £7.20 per hour - an increase of 50p per hour on the previous national minimum wage requirement. A Government spokesman responded: ""The national living wage has delivered the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years and they will continue to see their pay go up, with the rate set to increase to 60% of median earnings by 2020. ""But we want to go further by creating good quality jobs for all through our modern Industrial Strategy, boosting earning power and improving living standards across the country."""
2017-10-12,The Queen's former press secretary has told Sky News there are probably tensions between staff in the royal households as younger members of the Royal Family take on more official duties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171013053528/http://news.sky.com/story/conflict-likely-among-staff-as-royal-family-enters-a-new-era-11077984,"""I don't think there is a conflict behind the scenes as far as the main players (the royals) are concerned… but there probably is a conflict between the people who are organising them,"" said Dickie Arbiter. ""There's a tendency for people who join the royal households to get a bit of red carpet fever, feel a bit more important than they should do and don't get on with the job properly. ""So there is a conflict of interest, a personality clash amongst each other, and that is not good."" Palace advisers use the phrase ""deconflicting"" when they talk about the meetings between the palaces to make sure important engagements don't overlap and they aren't too many clashes between royal diaries. But Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace do still at times work to their own agendas, with their own distinctive priorities, as staff try to manage the needs of an ageing monarch. The announcement in the summer that the Queen's private secretary and most senior adviser Sir Christopher Geidt was stepping down also led to suggestions of tensions behind the scenes. Reports claimed Prince Charles had forced him to go because he disagreed with plans to make ""Team Windsor"", as the royals are known, work together more closely. Clarence House and Buckingham Palace strenuously denied the claims. In September, a statement on their behalf said: ""Recent years have seen an ever-closer working relationship between all the different royal households and their respective teams. ""The Prince of Wales and the entire Royal Family are committed to supporting the Queen in whatever way they can at Her Majesty's request."" It was announced on Wednesday that the Queen would break with tradition this Remembrance Sunday and has asked the Prince Charles to lay her wreath at the Cenotaph. Instead, she will stand with the Duke of Edinburgh on a balcony of the Foreign Office to observe the service. The decision has been seen by royal watchers as another significant move towards the gradual handover of the monarch's responsibilities to younger members of the family, most notably her son, the heir to the throne. While the Palace does not like to talk about transition, they have already smoothly managed the allocation of overseas tours and some of the Queen's ceremonial duties. This summer Prince William gave up his job flying with the East Anglian Air Ambulance so he could concentrate on royal engagements. Author Robert Lacey, who has written books about the Queen, and most recently worked as historical adviser on TV series The Crown, told Sky News it marks a fascinating phase for the Windsors - with complex family dynamics. ""We're actually talking about a new era,"" he said. ""There's all sorts of things to be looking out for. How Charles and his mother will get on - they've had their difficulties in the past, and Charles has had his difficulties with his own two sons. ""It's a new regime we're looking at and it's very exciting, and on occasions like the Cenotaph we're going to see it in practice."" The Queen is still undertaking a significant number of public engagements however, and on Thursday evening attended her first following her return from Balmoral. Accompanied by Princess Anne, the monarch was in attendance at the Army and Navy Club in central London to mark the centenary of the Women's Royal Navy Service and the Women's Auxiliary Army Corp."

He said: ""He's pursuing a line which is not in the public interest, not in the country's interest and is not responsible."" Lord Lawson also expressed his dismay at the Prime Minister's refusal earlier this week to answer a question on how she would vote in the event of another Brexit referendum. ""I was surprised by that equivocation - I couldn't see why on Earth she'd want to equivocate,"" he said. ""Why on Earth would she want to do that? What possible gain could it be?"" He went on to suggest that such equivocation actually weakens the UK's negotiating hand. ""It only helps the negotiators on the other side of the table,"" he said. ""It doesn't help our position. I suppose you could say it was a sign of honesty but I don't think it was politically astute."" Brexit was not the only issue in Lord Lawson's cross hairs. On the day the Government unveiled its energy price cap, the former chancellor - who in the Thatcher government led its privatisation efforts - described the policy as ""a big mistake"". ""It won't help the public at all,"" he said. ""It's an error."" He ascribed the Prime Minister's efforts on the issue to her understanding of economics, saying: "" I think the problem is that economics, and economic policy and economic thinking, is not her thing. ""She's never had any experience of that whatever. She was home secretary for a long time. She's never been an economic minister of any kind nor has she ever run a business. ""She's never had the opportunity to think these things through."" Business leaders have long criticised the Prime Minister for being disengaged from the interests of the commercial world. But these comments might strike a chord most with free-marketeer Thatcherite Conservative MPs, many of whom feel uncomfortable with the Tories aping what was first an Ed Miliband policy. Dozens of Tory MPs feel the party has been drifting too far left and is providing the intellectual and political space in which a far-left Labour party and Corbynism can thrive. Comments from one of the architects of Thatcherism will do little to allay those fears."

The four-inch stub was taken from an ashtray by British airman Corporal William Alan Turner, whose crew flew Churchill and his wife back to London. The label on the Cuban cigar included Churchill's name and the item was accompanied with a signed photo which showed the prime minister with it in his hand. On the back of the photo, Corporal Turner wrote: ""'A photograph I took from the doorway of York MW101 at Le Bourget airport, Paris, on 11th May 1947 just before we flew black to Northolt.

Boston-based RR Auction said the cigar was bought by an unnamed collector in Palm Beach, Florida. It is not the first time one of Churchill's cigars has made thousands of pounds at auction. In 2010, a Havana cigar he gave to a fellow diner at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo in 1963 sold for £2,125 when it went under the hammer. Five years later, the chewed end of a cigar he smoked at a hospital in 1962 fetched £2,000."

NHS leaders have been planning for months to avoid a repeat of the near-meltdown last winter, when high demand forced A&E departments to turn patients away. Trusts have been ordered to free up additional beds by discharging more patients into community care, and a national vaccination program is planned to try to head off a flu virus that has caused a record outbreak in the Antipodes. Dr Nick Scriven, President of the SAM, said any significant flu or virus outbreak could cripple the system, and accused the Government of failing to properly fund the NHS. ""Over the last two to three years we haven't had to deal with any major outbreaks of infection such as norovirus or flu, but this year we are predicting a bad flu season that will overwhelm us after what we've witnessed in Australia and New Zealand,"" he said. ""For all the talk of preparations, on the ground it feels as though there is nothing new this year other than crossed fingers - which is fair comment as the Government has failed to tackle effectively the issues behind the pressures we face. ""If, as we expect, we see a flu outbreak, I think the NHS - in terms of both beds and clinical staff - will break far worse than last year and elective activity will almost certainly cease for several months."" The warning comes as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announces the extension of an existing Government scheme to try to recruit more GPs into areas with acute shortages, including rural and coastal communities. Mr Hunt will announce a package of measures to tackle the recruitment crisis at the Royal College of GPs annual conference in Liverpool. An existing scheme offering £20,000 ""golden hellos"" to trainee GPs will be extended into 2018 with the aim of recruiting 200 GPs in areas of most need. Mr Hunt will also announce the expansion of a ""fast-track"" programme, currently targeting doctors in Australia. The Government has pledged to recruit 5,000 doctors by 2020, but NHS England recently quadrupled its forecast for how many will have to come from abroad from 500 to 2,000. As well as Australia, doctors in New Zealand, Canada, the United States and India will be targeted. GPs considering retirement will also be offered ""flexible working arrangements"" to try to persuade them to stay in post rather than leaving and exacerbating the recruitment crisis. The British Medical Association said the measures do not go far enough. Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chair, said: ""These proposals do appear to acknowledge the specific problems facing rural areas in England. ""But 'golden hellos' are not a new idea and unlikely to solve the overall workforce crisis given we are failing badly to train enough GPs to meet current demands."""

""What we have is a small number of unscrupulous lawyers who are taking advantage of the lack of any limit on costs to pursue spurious claims,"" said Justice Minister Dominic Raab. ""By moving to fixed costs, we can end some of that uncertainty and cut out the spurious claims, so they are not pushing up the prices for regular holidaymakers."" There were 5,000 claims in 2013, but that figure rocketed to 35,000 last year, despite the fact that the number of illnesses reported in holiday resorts has actually declined. Holidaymaker Tracey Krieger from north London enjoyed a wonderful fortnight in Mexico with her husband and was stunned to receive a cold call on her mobile several months after she returned home. ""They asked if I had been ill while on holiday and when I said I hadn't, they kept asking and pushing,"" she told Sky News. ""I find it abhorrent that anyone would make a bogus claim for illness when they have had a perfect holiday abroad. It's a disgrace that this is going on and that so many people are doing it. ""It's pushing up the cost of holidays for every family and it's so wrong."" Records show that the average value of a gastric illness claim is around £2,100 while the cost of defending the same claim is £3,800."

It will say that the country needs to address the problems of three Cs - congestion, capacity and carbon. ""Congestion is the single biggest problem facing Britain at the moment,"" Lord Adonis said in an interview with Sky News. ""Our roads, our railways, our digital systems, our mobile phone systems, they're all congested and we need to have congestion-busting measures so people can go about their jobs, go about their lives without constantly being disrupted by infrastructure that doesn't work. ""If we don't tackle that congestion, then this country will seize up, and it seizes up then there will be fewer jobs, we'll all be a lot poorer and no one will thank the politicians of this generation."" The report has identified the ""most serious infrastructure failing of all"" as the ""endless delay to a Parliamentary decision"" over building a third runway at Heathrow Airport. ""There is no space for new flights at Heathrow, which means no space to make fresh connections to important new markets, so the commission says 'get on with It',"" said Adonis. ""Heathrow is our most important port and it is effectively closed to new markets. ""We've spent 13 years talking about a new runway - it's now time to get on with it and open by the mid 2020s."" John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow, told Sky News that the airport had ""learnt lessons"" from its history of lobbying for a third runway. ""In the past we were guilty of overlooking issues such as local communities and environmental impact, and instead concentrating on the economic case. Now we've changed our approach. ""It's great that people like the infrastructure commission are now saying 'get on with it', and asking the Government why they haven't done this. ""That pull-through will help to make sure that, this time, it gets delivered."" As well as Lord Adonis, the commission includes a number of prominent businessmen, economists and infrastructure specialist. The deputy chair is Sir John Armitt, former chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority. The commission's report will say that the huge costs of some infrastructure projects are worth paying because of the economic rewards they generate in return. As well as investment to upgrade the existing transport infrastructure, its most prominent demands will be to call for huge investment in a 5G mobile phone network and also a national ""smart charging"" system for electric cars. At the moment, there are fears that a dramatic uptake in the use of electric vehicles could overburden the national grid. Other suggestions will be for more house building, improved flood protection, better heating for homes and inner-city public transport."

Ms Trent, who was in London to celebrate her birthday, said: ""It was like when you open a can of coke, there was this hissing sound like an aerosol. It touched my neck and my skin was coming off in my hands. ""I knew it was acid. Nothing blisters that quickly other than acid. I've been in clubs before where there was pepper spray. ""My neck blistered straight away."" Arthur Collins and his friend Andre Phoenix, 21, are both on trial at Wood Green Crown Court accused of five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, and 11 counts of actual bodily harm. Collins, 25, is the ex-boyfriend of TOWIE star Ferne McCann and father of her unborn child. Giving evidence, Ms Trent described the moment she was hit by the substance at the nightclub, saying her neck ""blistered straight away"". She said nightclub security guards ""didn't seem to have a clue"" and only realised that ""something serious had happened"" when she showed one her injuries. Ms Trent also described the club security as ""appalling"", with minimal checks on the door. She told jurors paramedics took over an hour to arrive following the incident. Prosecutor Luke Ponte told the court the incident happened quickly, with no indication something was about to take place. Another victim, Phoebe Georgiou, who suffered chest burns which had to be treated at a specialist burns unit, cried as she described how she froze after she was hit by the acid. Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, denies the charges against him. He does not dispute throwing the liquid, but says he did not know it was acid in the bottle. Phoenix, of Clyde Road, Tottenham, north London, denies the same offences. The unidentified corrosive substance had a pH level of 1, a similar level of acidity to stomach acid. The trial continues."
2017-10-12,"The Prime Minister's cap on energy prices to protect households from rip-off bills will be a ""temporary measure"", it has been revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171013053528/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-mays-promised-energy-price-cap-will-expire-in-2020-11076798,"In a statement to financial markets, ministers revealed their plans for a draft law to cap energy prices for those on a standard variable tariff and other default tariffs. But the law will expire in 2020, it was disclosed, with the potential for it to be extended for a further three years at most. If passed, the proposed legislation would force regulator Ofgem to impose an ""absolute cap"" as soon as possible. A pledge to change the law was included in the Conservative manifesto before June's General Election, but was dropped from the subsequent Queen's Speech after some Tory MPs claimed it was state intervention and anti-free market. But after 192 MPs of all parties wrote to the PM in September complaining that poorer customers were being preyed on by energy firms, Mrs May revived the plan and backed a price cap in her recent Tory conference speech. Suppliers reacted with fury as billions of pounds were wiped off the value of their shares after the pledge. The draft bill putting a cap on tariffs will be scrutinised by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee of MPs, in a move the Government says will help build a cross-party consensus. Under the bill, the regulator Ofgem would bring in a price cap on the poor value tariffs that exploit customer loyalty, which would protect around two-thirds of households and 18 million customer accounts, according to the Government. ""I have been clear that our broken energy market has to change,"" the Prime Minister said. ""It has to offer fairer prices for millions of loyal customers who have been paying hundreds of pounds too much."" Speaking in the Commons, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the bill would ""preserve the ability for the market to act competitively"" and ""allow for effective competition and to give a reason for people to shop around"". The Competition and Markets Authority found that customers of the so-called 'big six' energy suppliers on standard variable and default energy tariffs are paying £1.4bn a year more than they need. Ofgem this week announced it is extending its existing price cap for vulnerable consumers and the Government says five million households will now, for the first time, benefit from protection against rip-off energy bills this winter. Four million of those are on pre-payment meters. The regulator will, from February, protect a further one million households who receive the Warm Home Discount. The Government says it welcomes Ofgem's move, but claims the regulator could go further to protect everyone on default tariffs from unfair practices. Labour's shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, described an energy price cap as a ""suitable temporary measure"" but claimed ""the market as a whole needs to be reformed"". Speaking to Sky News, she challenged the Government to meet her party's plans for a cap of £1,000 on the average household energy bill. Responding to the bill's unveiling in the Commons, Ms Long-Bailey said the Government had taken too long to act. She said: ""Due to the Government's dithering, the four million households in fuel poverty - almost one million of which includes a disabled person - will face another winter of cold homes and astronomical bills.

2017-10-12,No 10 has been forced to delay its flagship Brexit bill after Conservative rebels backed a series of hostile amendments.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171013053528/http://news.sky.com/story/hostile-tory-rebels-force-no-10-to-delay-flagship-brexit-bill-11077953,"Ministers had planned to push the EU Withdrawal Bill, which has passed its second reading in the House of Commons, through to committee stage next week. But the timetable has slipped after the Tory whips decided they needed more time to strike compromises with rebel MPs in order to avoid a series of damaging defeats. In total 300 amendments and 54 new clauses have been tabled to the bill, which transfers European law onto the domestic statute book after Brexit, underlining the resistance within the Commons from both opposition parties and some Conservative MPs. Thirteen amendments have enough support from Conservative MPs to overturn Theresa May's working majority of 13, which is causing obvious headaches for chief whip Gavin Williamson. Government insiders told Sky News that the volume of amendments that need to be considered and responded to means the legislation won't be ready for line-by-line committee stage scrutiny next week. Labour seized on the delay as evidence the Brexit bill ""was not fit for purpose"" and said Mrs May was potentially facing more than double the number of defeats on this bill than former prime minister John Major suffered at the hands of the Maastricht rebels. ""The Tories' repeal bill is simply not fit for purpose. It would give huge and unaccountable power to Ministers and puts vital rights and protections at risk,"" Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News. ""Theresa May must start listening to the legitimate concerns of Labour and some of her own MPs and urgently change approach."" Peers have also voiced their concerns over the legislation, warning last week in a House of Lords committee report that the repeal bill will give ""excessively wide"" powers to Government ministers after Brexit. The bill will shift some 12,000 EU regulations onto the British statute book. But the Government is facing serious challenges over its attempt to secure sweeping ""Henry VIII powers"", which give ministers the right to make legislative changes to enact Brexit without full parliamentary scrutiny. Ten Tory rebels are also backing an amendment demanding that the final Brexit deal be approved by parliamentary statute, which would give MPs the ability to propose changes to the deal: to date the Government has only agreed to give parliament a vote on the final Brexit deal. Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons, confirmed on Thursday there would be no debate in parliament on the EU Withdrawal bill. ""What I can say to all members is of course, there are some 300 amendments and 53 new clauses being proposed, quite rightly, by members who have very real concerns about the Bill. Those are being closely evaluated. ""That is taking a bit of time to have proper, thoughtful, well considered responses to those. But we will of course be bringing forward."" MPs are due to spend eight days debating the repeal bill at committee stage, which will then undergo further scrutiny in the Commons and the Lords before it is approved."

Joking with friends, he had put the fish over his mouth but it wriggled free and jumped in, blocking his throat completely. Paramedics arrived within minutes to find the man's friends giving him CPR after he had collapsed and stopped breathing. ""We were told he had a whole fish stuck in his windpipe,"" said Martyn Box, from South Western Ambulance Service (SWAS). The paramedics managed to restore his pulse after discovering his heart had stopped, but despite using artificial ventilation could not get oxygen into his lungs. SWAS paramedic Matt Harrison said they knew time was very short. ""It was clear that we needed to get the fish out or this patient was not going to survive the short journey to Royal Bournemouth Hospital,"" said Mr Harrison. He used a laryngoscope to fully extend the mouth and a pair of forceps to ""dislodge the tip of the tail"". ""Very carefully, so as not to break the tail off, I tried to remove it, although the fish's barbs and gills were getting stuck on the way back up,"" explained Mr Harrison. ""I was acutely aware that I only had one attempt at getting this right, as if I lost grip or a piece broke off and it slid further out of sight then there was nothing more that we could have done... ""Eventually after six attempts the fish came out in one piece and to our amazement it was a whole Dover sole, measuring approximately 14cm in length."" The patient - who has not been named - suffered no lasting effects and has made a full recovery."

Their business models work by providing a food ordering platform and delivery drivers to restaurants. The eateries pay for the service to expand their reach and customer base. Rivals include UberEATS and Deliveroo. Martin Cave, who chaired the CMA's investigation, said: ""We carefully assessed competition in this rapidly evolving industry to make sure this merger would not result in increased prices or reduced quality of offering for either restaurants or their customers. ""We obtained evidence from all the major industry participants and carried out surveys, with the public and restaurants, to understand how the merger could impact both types of customers. ""We found that Hungryhouse was a weak competitor to Just Eat and so competition is unlikely to be substantially reduced by this merger, especially given the entry and rapid expansion of innovative suppliers in this sector."" The CMA said its provisional findings were now the subject of a consultation exercise, lasting until 2 November. It will announce its final decision in the following weeks. Just Eat first announced the takeover in December last year. It said on Thursday: ""We are pleased that the CMA has provisionally concluded that this transaction does not lessen competition. ""We look forward to continuing to deploy our technology and expertise to help more independent restaurants develop and grow their businesses, while offering an even better service to consumers."" Its shares were up more than 5% in late morning trade on the London Stock Exchange."

The Government was informed by CIA chiefs in June that US forces had killed Jones, 50, in a missile strike close to the Iraq/Syria border, The Sun reports. However, it was kept secret on both sides of the Atlantic over fears her 12-year-old son Jojo may have also died in the blast. It remains unclear if he was killed and sources said the attack would have been aborted if it was known he was close by, the newspaper added. Sky's Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said: ""UK Defence sources have told Sky News they believe the strike was successful but question some of the detail being reported in the media. ""The UK and US military has been working closely together on a number of high-profile targets in recent months and Jones is believed to have been on that list."" Jones became known as the White Widow after her British jihadist husband Junaid Hussain was killed in a US drone strike in August 2015. Before fleeing to Syria, computer hacker Hussain admitted publishing Tony Blair's address in 2011 and was jailed for six months after making hoax calls to a UK counter-terror hotline a year later. At the time of his death, the 21-year-old from Birmingham had allegedly been planning ""barbaric attacks against the West"", including terror plots targeting ""high profile public commemorations"". In an exclusive report in 2015, Sky News revealed the couple used online messaging services to urge British would-be recruits to carry out ""lone wolf"" attacks in the UK. In one conversation with an undercover journalist, Jones detailed the materials needed to make a bomb and said she could help construct a device remotely. Following the death of Hussain, Jones was reportedly placed in charge of the female wing of IS' Anwar al-Awlaki batallion - a foreign fighter unit formed with the purpose of planning and executing attacks in the West. The 50-year-old used her Twitter account to recruit women and shared pictures of herself with weapons. She also posted comments such as: ""You Christians all need beheading with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at Raqqa ... Come here I'll do it for you."" Despite this, Sky News was told in June that the jihadist was not happy in Syria and wanted to return to Britain. The wife of another immigrant to the so-called Islamic caliphate said she knew Jones and described her as ""very cute"". She added: ""(Jones) was crying and wants to get back to Britain but ISIS is preventing her because she is now a military wife. She told me she wish to go to her country."" Major General Chip Chapman, the former MoD head of counter terror, told Sky News that Jones was a ""significant"" target for the US and UK. He said: ""Recently IS have said women should get involved in jihad - that's a sign of weakness. ""If you take out those who are high value target women it is going to have an impact at the operation level of IS."" Asked about reports Jones' son was killed in the strike, Maj Gen Chapman added: ""It is a difficult one because under the UN Charters he is under the age of what we would classify as a soldier."" He continued: ""Even if he got up to really bad things, he shouldn't have been targeted. We don't know for sure whether he was with her or not."""

In response, Mr Davis pointed to ""significant progress"" since negotiations first began in June as he attempted to pressure the EU to loosen its strict negotiating guidelines. Mr Barnier said he would not be able to report ""sufficient progress"" on the key withdrawal issues - the financial settlement, citizens' rights and Northern Ireland - for him to tell EU leaders to sanction the second phase of negotiations. Mark Watts from @UKTiEurope talks to @SkyNews about the dangers for transport industry of slow #Brexit progress or a ‘no deal’ scenario pic.twitter.com/gV4RMFyQKT His comments saw the pound sterling sink against both the dollar and euro. The European Commission official said the Brexit bill remained a key sticking point in talks, with ""technical discussions"" but no formal negotiations on the subject this week. ""We are at a state of deadlock on this question, which is very disturbing,"" he said, before declaring the EU would not make ""concessions"" on any of the three divorce issues. Mr Davis admitted there was still ""much work"" to be done, but said there had been movement on divorce issues, including a ""rigorous examination"" of the financial settlement by UK officials. The Brexit Secretary also highlighted how some withdrawal issues were ""dependent on discussions on our future relationship"". He said: ""I make no secret of the fact that to provide certainty we must talk about the future."" UK sources close to the negotiations told Sky News the UK will not budge one bit over the financial settlement until the EU offers some slack over the sequencing of talks. Mr Davis expressed his hope the EU27 will hand Mr Barnier ""the means to progress"" during Brexit negotiations, while the European Commission official himself vowed to ""explore ways to get out of deadlock"", adding: ""Decisive progress is within our grasp."" Despite insisting he will ""scrupulously"" follow the framework for negotiations handed to him by the 27 EU member states, Mr Barnier offered some hope Brexit talks could progress before the end of the year. He said: ""With political will decisive progress is within our grasp within the next two months."" After next week's Brussels summit, EU leaders meet again on 14 December, before which Mr Barnier might finally recommend they authorise the next stage of negotiations. Speaking later at a press conference in London alongside his Polish counterpart, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson added to Mr Davis' efforts to force the EU into budging from its strict negotiating stance. ""We think we've made some very helpful suggestions to get the great ship moving down the slipway and onto the open seas,"" he said. ""That's what we all want to see, we see no reason why that should not take place and we're looking for some urgency from our friends and partners and time to put a bit of a tiger in the tank and get this thing done."" Following the news conference in Brussels, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer urged Mr Davis to request an additional emergency round of talks before next week's European Council summit. Later, during a visit to a community centre in Shipley, West Yorkshire, Jeremy Corbyn said his views had not changed on Britain's EU membership. Asked whether he would still vote Remain at a second EU referendum, after the Prime Minister dodged the same question earlier this week, the Labour leader insisted ""there isn't going to be another referendum"". ""I voted Remain because I thought the best option was to remain,"" Mr Corbyn added. ""I haven't changed my mind on that but we accept the result of the referendum."""
2017-10-12,"Shareholders of Sky plc, the owner of Sky News, have voted to reappoint James Murdoch as chairman of Europe's largest pay-TV broadcaster.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171013053528/http://news.sky.com/story/sky-investors-back-reappointment-of-chairman-james-murdoch-11077632,"The motion to reappoint Mr Murdoch, a former chief executive of Sky, was passed with 78% of votes. That included votes cast on behalf of 21st Century Fox, Sky's largest shareholder, which is capped at 37.19% - and means that Mr Murdoch's appointment was also backed by a majority of independent shareholders. Some shareholder advisory groups had called on investors to vote against Mr Murdoch's reappointment on the grounds that he is also chief executive of 21st Century Fox. They claimed that, because Fox is currently trying to buy full control of Sky, he could not be a completely independent chairman of the latter. Mr Murdoch won 51% of votes cast by independent shareholders at the annual general meeting - up from 49% last year. There was a larger vote, however, against Sky's remuneration report. While just under 71% of investors voting did so in favour of the report, some 29% voted against approving the report. The vote is non-binding. In a stock exchange announcement detailing the AGM vote, Sky said: ""The board is pleased that the majority of resolutions have been passed with a high level of support from shareholders. ""The board notes the significant vote against resolution 3, the director's remuneration report and resolution 12, the re-election of James Murdoch, and will continue to engage with shareholders to understand their views as part of its ongoing programme of engagement."" During the meeting, one investor questioned both the terms of the deal and Mr Murdoch's position as chairman of Sky, given his role as 21st Century Fox's chief executive. The shareholder, Hugh Lawson, said: ""I think the board lacks independence. Fox is getting a sweetheart deal out of this and mainly I think it's because of the lack of independence on the board."" In response, Martin Gilbert, Sky's deputy chairman, pointed out that Sky's board had formed an independent committee to evaluate the terms of 21st Century Fox's takeover, which he said had met 11 times since the takeover approach was tabled in December last year. The committee includes Mr Gilbert, Jeremy Darroch, Sky's chief executive and Andrew Griffith, Sky's chief operating officer. The takeover, which is currently being scrutinised by the Competition and Markets Authority on public interest grounds having been cleared by regulators in all the other countries in which Sky broadcasts, values the whole of the company at £18.5bn. Mr Gilbert was also asked about recent allegations of sexual harassment at Fox News, the flagship news channel owned by 21st Century Fox, which has claimed the jobs of a number of senior executives and personalities at the channel. He told shareholders he was ""pretty confident"" that this would not have an effect on the CMA's investigation. Earlier, Sky reported what were regarded by City analysts as strong results for the first three months of its financial year. Like-for-like revenues during the three months to the end of September were £3.3bn, up 5.5% on the same period a year ago, while EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation) rose by 11% to £582m. Mr Darroch said it was a strong start to the new financial year: ""Against the backdrop of pressure on consumer spending and lower spend on UK television advertising, we were particularly pleased with our own EBITDA growth of 15% in our established business. ""We continue to see good demand for our products and services with 51% more new customers joining Sky than a year ago."" He said the first series of Sky's home-grown drama Riviera achieved 20 million downloads, while Game of Thrones had become the most watched series ever on Sky. He pointed out that in addition to Sky's existing markets - the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy - the company had just launched consumer streaming services in Spain and Switzerland. Shares of Sky, which are valued at 1075p under 21st Century Fox's takeover bid, closed 13p higher at 926.5p."

Staff had voted overwhelmingly earlier this month in favour of industrial action in a long-running dispute over pensions, pay and jobs. Union leaders say they have been trying to find a solution to the impasse for 18 months. But a High Court judge supported Royal Mail's case that the CWU was breaking its contract by calling a strike before outside mediation, which began on 5 October, is completed. The injunction is necessary to prevent hundreds of thousands of people across the UK being deliberately inconvenienced as well as the company suffering commercially, Royal Mail has said. In granting the order, Mr Justice Supperstone said: ""I consider the strike call to be unlawful and the defendant is obliged to withdraw its strike call until the external mediation process has been exhausted."" Royal Mail won the injunction but we stand here with 90% yes vote and more strike action ready to come. Your move #RiseUp ðŸ¦? The disagreement centres on the closure of Royal Mail's final salary pension scheme to new entrants, the terms of a replacement scheme, and also rows over pay and delivery office closures. The CWU says its gripes with the company are all linked to the controversial privatisation - accusing bosses of cost cutting and asset stripping to satisfy shareholders. Speaking outside court, CWU general secretary Dave Ward warned that, as there is now a time frame for the external talks, ""we believe we can still take action before Christmas"". Mr Ward told the firm its legal victory was not the end of the matter. He said: ""The company are deluded if they believe their courtroom politics will resolve this dispute. Instead, the company's actions will have the complete opposite effect. ""Postal workers' attitude towards the company will harden and it makes us more determined than ever to defend our members pensions, jobs, service and achieve our objectives. ""Unless the company significantly shifts its position on a range of issues and we can quickly conclude a good agreement for our members then strike action is inevitable."" That position was reinforced by a tweet from the union, which said: ""Royal Mail won the injunction but we stand here with 90% yes vote and more strike action ready to come. Your move #RiseUp""."

Vienna says it contravenes EU law because while all will have to pay, German motorists will be refunded via reductions in their vehicle tax. Austria's transport minister, Joerg Leichtfried, said in a statement: ""This is indirect discrimination on the basis of nationality. ""The German toll is against foreigners. Germans won't pay because they are German. Austrians will pay because they are Austrian. We're not going to stand for that."" The 30-page lawsuit is being filed at the European Court of Justice on Thursday. By imposing the tolls, Germany is exploiting its dominant position within Europe, Mr Leichtfried said. An estimated 1.8m Austrian commuters will be affected by the proposed scheme, which has also been criticised by Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. Those coming from outside Germany will be able to buy a 10-day toll of between €2.50 (£2.25) and €25 (£23), or a two-month pass of between €7 (£6) and €50 (£45). The charge depends on the vehicle's fuel efficiency and is paid for in advance - also via a sticker scheme. Some experts estimate the project will bring in about €500m (£451m) a year. The case is expected to come to court either late next year or early 2019."

In video footage to emerge from a fringe event at last week's Conservative Party conference, the Thurrock MP said: ""The reality is that the taxpayer shouldn't necessarily be propping up people to keep their property and hand it on to their children when they're generating massive care needs."" She later added the Tories will be ""very much looking at… the whole issue of caps and floors"", with the Government set to consult on changes to the social care system. Speaking of the current system being ""unfair"" on taxpayers, Ms Doyle-Price went on: ""People are now well into their pension ages sitting in homes that really are too big for their needs and we do need to start having those conversations about what's appropriate earlier."" In the Conservative manifesto ahead of June's General Election, the party said they would take into account the value of a person's home when means-testing care funding. Although the party promised to protect £100,000 of a person's wealth critics soon dubbed the proposed policy a ""dementia tax"", as those facing expensive care could face huge costs. Amid the backlash, Theresa May was forced to announce an unspecified cap would be introduced on care costs, although many blamed the row for derailing the Tory campaign ahead of an election which cost the party their House of Commons majority. The controversial plans appeared to have been sidelined when the Queen's Speech included merely a commitment to ""improve"" social care funding, but stopped short of specific proposals ahead of a consultation. Responding to Ms Doyle-Price's comments, a Downing Street spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: ""We clearly recognise that there is an imbalance in the current system with the way people's assets are treated depending on whether they need domiciliary care or not, but as a party we want to be able to promote people passing on property to their children as much as possible. ""We are looking at social care as a long-term challenge and we will publish a green paper in due course."" Labour accused Ms Doyle-Price of reviving the so-called ""dementia tax"" row. ""The idea of a 'dementia tax' was rightly rejected by the public during the General Election,"" said party leader Jeremy Corbyn. ""It can't be right that if you have a heart condition you're treated on the NHS but if you have dementia you have to pay with your home."""

But the businessman who accused him has now dropped the complaint after learning of the gravity of the punishment facing him. ""With a certain distance from the incident and the punishment to be expected for the suspect, our employee decided to withdraw the complaint despite the harassment having been confirmed by several witnesses,"" the accuser's employer, Neumann & Esser, said. Mr Harron said he was moving through the crowded bar holding a drink in front of him, and inadvertently touched a man on the hip to avoid hitting him or spilling the beverage. Police arrived less than half-an-hour later, his representatives have said, leading to Mr Harron being charged with public indecency. He was locked up for five days in Al Barsha prison before being released on bail, with his passport confiscated. The electrician lost his job after the incident, has spent more than £30,000 on legal fees, and has been unable to leave Dubai for three months. His lawyers have submitted an appeal and say they are ""hopeful"" Mr Harron will be able to return home, but say a hearing is not scheduled until 22 October.

Joking with friends, he had put the fish over his mouth but it wriggled free and jumped in, blocking his throat completely. Paramedics arrived within minutes to find the man's friends giving him CPR after he had collapsed and stopped breathing. ""We were told he had a whole fish stuck in his windpipe,"" said Martyn Box, from South Western Ambulance Service (SWAS). The paramedics managed to restore his pulse after discovering his heart had stopped, but despite using artificial ventilation could not get oxygen into his lungs. SWAS paramedic Matt Harrison said they knew time was very short. ""It was clear that we needed to get the fish out or this patient was not going to survive the short journey to Royal Bournemouth Hospital,"" said Mr Harrison. He used a laryngoscope to fully extend the mouth and a pair of forceps to ""dislodge the tip of the tail"". ""Very carefully, so as not to break the tail off, I tried to remove it, although the fish's barbs and gills were getting stuck on the way back up,"" explained Mr Harrison. ""I was acutely aware that I only had one attempt at getting this right, as if I lost grip or a piece broke off and it slid further out of sight then there was nothing more that we could have done... ""Eventually after six attempts the fish came out in one piece and to our amazement it was a whole Dover sole, measuring approximately 14cm in length."" The patient - who has not been named - suffered no lasting effects and has made a full recovery."

His comments come at a fragile juncture for the Brexit talks, which are still mired in discussions about the size of Britain's divorce bill. Hours before Mr Hammond spoke to Sky News, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""I'm not in a revenge mood. I'm not hating the British. ""The Europeans have to be grateful for so many things Britain has brought to Europe before war, during war, after war. But now they have to pay."" Mr Hammond, who has been urged to resign by prominent Brexiteers, including former chancellor Lord Lawson, said he had no intention of standing down. He described as ""bizarre"" allegations from some MPs that he was ""talking down the economy"". ""It would be absurd to pretend that the process we're in at the moment hasn't created uncertainty in the business community. As you know, businesses crave clarity and stability,"" Mr Hammond said. ""The sooner we get that clarity the better for the UK economy. This is a very short term uncertainty problem around the UK economy."" The Chancellor has been under fire after writing in a newspaper column this week that he had no immediate plans to spend more to buttress the economy against the prospect of there being no deal in the Brexit talks. He admitted that his column ""didn't land as planned"". Mr Hammond said: ""It was intended to rebut the allegation that I was blocking plans for no deal.

The Academy has already described the allegations as ""repugnant, abhorrent and antithetical"" to its standards. Also meeting to discuss the scandal is the Producers' Guild of America, which will ""consider disciplinary proceedings and the status of (Weinstein's) membership"", a source told AFP. The meetings come after director and actor Quentin Tarantino said he is ""stunned"" and ""heartbroken"" about the allegations of sexual abuse and harassment surrounding Harvey Weinstein, his friend of 25 years. The pair have worked together on a number of Hollywood blockbusters. Weinstein's studio has produced all of Tarantino's movies since the 1994 hit Pulp Fiction. :: Goldman Sachs mulls its £750k Weinstein Co stake Their other films include Inglourious Basterds, The Hateful Eight and Django Unchained, which is The Weinstein Company's highest-grossing movie. Tarantino has released a statement through the Twitter account of actress Amber Tamblyn, who said he had asked her to do so following a ""long dinner"" the previous night. The director said: ""For the last week, I've been stunned and heartbroken about the revelations that have come to light about my friend for 25 years Harvey Weinstein. ""I need a few more days to process my pain, emotions, anger and memory and then I will speak publicly about it."" Last night I had a long dinner with my friend Quentin Tarantino.

From Quentin Tarantino: pic.twitter.com/jv0VQNrI91 Around 30 women, including actresses Angelina Jolie, Ashley Judd and Gwyneth Paltrow, have spoken out to say Weinstein had sexually harassed or sexually assaulted them since the New York Times first published the allegations last week. Three women have accused Weinstein of rape, according to The New Yorker, and actress Rose McGowan has also alleged rape. The actress, one of the mogul's early accusers, made the allegation in a series of tweets. Weinstein continues to ""unequivocally deny"" allegations of non-consensual sex against him, and of illegal sexual harassment. He was fired last Sunday by The Weinstein Company, the studio he co-founded with his brother Bob, and has been left by his wife. Police in the UK and US are investigating claims of sexual assault against Weinstein, who is understood to be undergoing rehabilitation in Arizona. On Thursday night, he had dinner at a restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to celebrity website TMZ, which said it was the producer's last meal out before he checks into rehab. Meanwhile, Cagney and Lacey star Tyne Daly has expressed frustration that many people were acting surprised about the allegations. The US star said: ""I'm sad that people are pretending that this is something extraordinary and new and amazing. 'Oh how shocking!' Oh come on. ""There's a great deal of hypocrisy going on and it makes it harder to sort out the good guys from the bad guys."" pic.twitter.com/xMdoA8fvDx On Friday, actress Nicole Kidman told young actresses to ""make sure you are protected"". She told Magic Radio: ""Particularly for a young girl, it's 'take care of yourself, make sure you are protected, don't let anyone break your spirit and be yourself'."" On the allegations facing Weinstein, she added: ""I've been working now for well over two decades for UN Women to eradicate violence against women, this is very important right now - we cannot tolerate this behaviour."" British actress Carey Mulligan said she hoped that speaking openly about the situation would change it. She said: ""Thank God it's all coming out, it's horrific. And thank God it's coming to the fore and these incredible women are feeling brave enough to be able to come forward and say something about it."" Director Oliver Stone posted on Facebook: ""I've been travelling for the last couple of days, I'm appalled and commend the courage of the women who've stepped forward to report sexual abuse or rape."" Stone said he would pull out of directing a Guantanamo series ""as long as the Weinstein Company is involved"". He had earlier told reporters at the Busan International Film Festival in South Korea he was a ""believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial"". Multiple Oscar winning actor Tom Hanks criticised Weinstein's initial apology, in which he claimed his behaviour was the result of growing up in the 1960s and 1970s. The Forrest Gump star told the New York Times: ""Look, I don't want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can't buy 'Oh, well, I grew up in the sixties and seventies and so therefore...' ""I did, too. So I think it's like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can."" Meanwhile, Amazon Studios chief Roy Price has been suspended amid claims he ""ignored"" allegations that Weinstein raped McGowan. In her posts on Twitter, McGowan claimed she warned Price about the Hollywood producer. It comes as Price faces a separate allegation from producer Isa Hackett, who claims the Amazon Studio chief inappropriately propositioned her in the back of taxi in 2015. In a statement, Amazon said it had placed Price on a leave of absence effective immediately."

In 2015, the charity received 27 reports of this kind of abuse being shared on Snapchat, but a year later that had shot up to 69. So far this year 119 complaints (a rise of 340%) have been reported and there are still three months of the year left. ""It's as shocking as it is disturbing and what's really saddening is that this abuse is mostly being committed by children,"" an RSPCA intelligence researcher, who works covertly to gather evidence for prosecutions, told Sky News. ""These children are then sharing the videos and pictures with their peers. Some days it's very difficult to get those images out of my head."" Some of the images passed to Sky News by the RSPCA were too disturbing to broadcast.

""Other people who will do it are trying to impress people with how cruel they can be. People have always done this. The difference now is that they can show a wider audience, as opposed to two or three lads doing something terrible, they can show a group of 20 people at the pub.""

The appeal judges said the school's policy caused detriment and less favourable treatment for both sets of pupils because of their sex. As a result, it was found to be contrary to the 2010 Equality Act. The ruling overturns last year's finding by a High Court judge that Ofsted inspectors were wrong to penalise the co-educational school for separating students. Following the ruling, Ofsted's chief inspector Amanda Spielman said: ""I am delighted that we have won this appeal. ""The school is teaching boys and girls entirely separately, making them walk down separate corridors, and keeping them apart at all times. ""This is discrimination and is wrong. It places these boys and girls at a disadvantage for life beyond the classroom and the workplace, and fails to prepare them for life in modern Britain."" The school believes that total separation of the sexes from Year 5 onwards is necessary for religious reasons. Children at the school between the ages of nine and 16 are separated for all their lessons, breaks, clubs and school trips. During the appeal hearing, the school's lawyer said boys and girls at the school were ""treated entirely equally while segregated"". He argued that the policy at al Hijrah, which is maintained by Birmingham City Council, was lawful. But the school's argument that ""separate but equal treatment by reason of gender cannot be unlawful discrimination, even it it is detrimental"" was rejected by the judges. The ruling will have implications for other schools that segregate pupils based on their sex. The appeal judges noted that: ""The school is not the only Islamic school which operates such a policy and that a number of Jewish schools with a particular Orthodox ethos and some Christian faith schools have similar practices."" They said Ofsted had main it clear that they would apply a ""consistent approach to all similarly organised schools"". Ms Spielman said Ofsted will be ""considering the ruling carefully to understand how this will affect future inspections"". A Department for Education spokesperson said they welcomed the Court of Appeal's judgement. They said the ruling ""supports the department's long-standing position that mixed schools should only separate children by gender in very limited circumstances where this can be justified and they can demonstrate that no pupil is disadvantaged by virtue of their gender""."

Minimum sentences were introduced for those aged 16 and over who are convicted of a second or subsequent offence of possession of a knife or offensive weapon. The punishment is at least six months' imprisonment, which can include suspended terms, for adults, while young offenders face a minimum four-month detention and training order. Judges must impose the minimum sentence unless there are particular circumstances relating to the latest offence, the previous offence or the offender which would ""make it unjust to do so in all the circumstances"". A new offence to stop the sale of acids and the most harmful corrosive substances to under-18s is also being considered. Police figures show there were 408 attacks using corrosive substances between November 2016 and April this year. ""The use of corrosive substances as a weapon is centuries old, but whilst the number of offences is relatively small, we are concerned about its increasing use as a weapon,"" the document says. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""All forms of violent crime are totally unacceptable, which is why we are taking action to restrict access to offensive weapons and crack down on those who carry acids with the intent to do harm.""

Collins, 25, is the ex-boyfriend of TOWIE star Ferne McCann and father of her unborn child. Giving evidence, Ms Trent described the moment she was hit by the substance at the nightclub, saying her neck ""blistered straight away"". She said nightclub security guards ""didn't seem to have a clue"" and only realised that ""something serious had happened"" when she showed one her injuries. Ms Trent also described the club security as ""appalling"", with minimal checks on the door. She told jurors paramedics took over an hour to arrive following the incident. Prosecutor Luke Ponte told the court the incident happened quickly, with no indication something was about to take place. Another victim, Phoebe Georgiou, who suffered chest burns which had to be treated at a specialist burns unit, cried as she described how she froze after she was hit by the acid. Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, denies the charges against him. He does not dispute throwing the liquid, but says he did not know it was acid in the bottle.

It has pledged to ""make things right"" since TfL's refusal last month to renew Uber's licence on the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"". The firm's approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers were cited among the concerns. An Uber spokesman said: ""While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. ""As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right."" Talks in the capital earlier this month between the company's new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi and transport commissioner Mike Brown were described by both sides as ""constructive"". Uber, which was licensed as a private hire company in London in 2012, has about 40,000 drivers in London and is used by 3.5 million people. It had until 13 October to appeal the decision and can continue to operate until the end of any appeal process. The company, which has been valued at almost $70bn, has been in turmoil in recent months over the conduct and subsequent exit of its founder, Travis Kalanick. Its expansion has been blighted by regulatory and legal complications worldwide, including wrangles over the employment rights of its drivers in the UK. The firm claims it is an agent for drivers - not an employer - and therefore does not need to offer benefits. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has accused Uber of not ""playing by the rules"". The company has accepted ""that in lots of places it has had the wrong attitude and needs to change""."

Mr Juncker also suggested Brexit will ""take longer than initially thought"" as he said the remaining 27 EU member states will not sanction the start of the second phase of talks at a Brussels summit next week. ""We cannot find for the time being a real compromise as far as the remaining financial commitments of the UK are concerned,"" Mr Juncker said, while speaking to students in his native Luxembourg. ""As we are not able to do this we will not be able to say in the European Council in October that now we can move to the second phase of negotiations. ""Things have to be done, one has to deliver. If you are sitting in a bar and if you are ordering 28 beers, and then suddenly some of your colleagues is leaving and he is not paying, that is not feasible. ""They have to pay, they have to pay, not in an impossible way."" But Mr Juncker insisted he is ""not in a revenge mood"" and ""not hating the British"", adding: ""The Europeans have to be so grateful for so many things Britain has brought to Europe."" :: Brexit Forensics: Nuclear industry prepares for 'no deal' Brexit Despite noting ""progress"" over the issue of citizens' rights post-Brexit, Mr Juncker asked: ""Why are we discussing nonsense like that?"" He added he didn't understand why both sides don't say ""things will stay as they are"" after the UK's exit, continuing: ""Citizens have rights because they are citizens, not because there is a Brexit issue which has to be discussed."" Responding to Mr Juncker's comments, Downing Street said the Prime Minister had made clear in her recent Florence speech the UK would honour its financial obligations. ""We will honour our commitments - the commitments that we have made during our period of membership of the EU - but the detail is for negotiation,"" a Number 10 spokeswoman said. On Thursday, EU lead negotiator Michel Barnier said he will not recommend the EU27 authorise Brexit talks move on from key divorce issues - the financial settlement, citizens' rights and Northern Ireland - when they gather in the Belgian capital on 19 October. Mr Barnier cited a ""very disturbing"" deadlock over the UK's financial settlement for being unable to judge ""sufficient progress"" has been made on withdrawal issues. But the European Commission official did offer some hope by claiming he would explore ""ways of getting out of this deadlock"" in time for the European Council summit on 14 December. The EU27 have demanded ""sufficient progress"" be met on divorce issues before allowing the second phase of negotiations to begin. :: CBI boss throws weight behind Hammond Brexit Secretary David Davis has stressed some withdrawal discussions can only be concluded once the framework of Britain's future relationship with the EU is known, and it is understood UK officials won't budge on the financial settlement until there is some slackening of the EU27's stance. Further hope was offered to the UK Government after it emerged the EU27 might start ""internal preparatory discussions"" on Britain's post-Brexit relationship from this month. Included in leaked draft conclusions for the 19 October European Council summit, the document revealed Mr Barnier could soon be invited to discuss the EU27's position on the second phase of negotiations ahead of the potential sanctioning of trade talks at December's summit."

Brady, who used the name Ian Stewart-Brady, died at the age of 79 on 15 May but his remains have not yet been disposed of. Sir Geoffrey was asked by two local authorities to make a decision relating to the disposal of the serial killer's body so that it could be ""lawfully and decently disposed of without further delay"". Brady and Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, tortured and murdered five children in the 1960s. Four of their victims were buried on Saddleworth Moor in the south Pennines. Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council and Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council were concerned that five months after Brady's death his solicitor Robin Makin had not made proper arrangements for the disposal, the court heard. The judge said the matter had to ""be taken out of Mr Makin's hands if the deceased's body is to be disposed of quickly, lawfully and decently."" Sir Geoffrey refused to allow the playing of the fifth movement of the Symphony Fantastique, by Hector Berlioz, at the cremation. He said: ""As the composer's programme notes describe, the theme and subject of the piece means legitimate offence would be caused to the families of the deceased's victims once it became known it had been played. ""It was not suggested by Mr Makin that the deceased had requested any other music to be played or any other ceremony to be performed, and in those circumstances, I propose to direct that there be no music and no ceremony."" Sir Geoffrey said that Brady's wishes ""are relevant"", but ""do not outweigh the need to avoid justified public indignation and actual unrest"". He added that an officer of Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council would arrange for the disposal of Brady's ashes."

Mr Osborne, who became editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper after being sacked from the Treasury by Mrs May last year, also refused to rule out a return to politics. ""I don't think you do a service to the party that I'm a member of, that I gave 25 years of my life to working for and promoting, by pretending there aren't some very serious challenges that the Government faces and the leadership faces,"" he said. Speaking to journalist Andrew Neil at an event hosted by The Spectator magazine, Mr Osborne added: ""Closing your eyes and hoping they'll go away, or exalting people to unity doesn't work in politics. ""You've got to have a clear plan, attempt to lead people in pursuit of that plan and that is what the Conservative Government needs to do. ""It's no good the Conservatives saying, 'Oh I wish we could all stop talking about it', you can't talk to a member of the Cabinet without talking about it. ""So, we've got to confront it, I want my party to do well, to win the next election. ""I don't want Jeremy Corbyn to be Prime Minister."" Mr Osborne famously described Mrs May as a ""dead woman walking"" after the election. On Thursday, he insisted he didn't want to get into a ""public slanging match"" but added: ""People are well aware of the things I think the Government needs to do."" Having stood down from Parliament at the General Election, Mr Osborne said he is now concentrating on his newspaper job, as well as his other roles advising asset management firm BlackRock and a professorship at California's Stanford University. But, leaving the path open for a return to politics, he added: ""I have a question in my own mind, which is 'do I really want to go back?' ""I was there, I did it, I'm proud of what I did. ""I worry that would be a mistake (to return) - I don't say never, because I think that's foolish. I don't rule it out."""

Prosecutors say he murdered Mr Nagle after the corrections officer wrote a disciplinary report against him for trying to take a peanut butter sandwich into a recreation yard against prison rules, according to court documents. Mr Nagle was repeatedly stabbed with a tape-wrapped metal rod, though an autopsy showed he died from a resulting heart attack. The torn report was found at the scene. Pruett, 38, was put to death by lethal injection on Thursday evening at Texas' death chamber in Huntsville after the Supreme Court rejected his lawyers' last-minute appeal to spare his life. He was the 544th person executed in the US state after the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The execution was Texas' sixth of the year. ""I've hurt a lot of people and a lot of people have hurt me. I love ya'll so much. Life don't end here it goes on forever,"" Pruett, who disputed his 2002 conviction until the end, was quoted as saying in his final statement by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ""I've had to learn lessons in life the hard way. One day there won't be a need to hurt people."" The Supreme Court said it rejected Pruett's petition about an hour before the scheduled execution - it did not provide a reason. Pruett's lawyers' petition stated: ""No witnesses testified they observed the attack, and no physical evidence connected Robert Pruett to the murder."" They said Pruett was convicted on the unreliable testimony of prison informants and that neither Pruett's fingerprints nor DNA material were found on the torn report. The appeal came after lawyers asked the state to release the shank and Mr Nagle's clothes for DNA testing following inconclusive tests in 2000. However, the state of Texas, in a legal filing with the Supreme Court, said: ""Pruett has raised nothing new that casts any doubt on his guilt."" Mr Nagle's family said in a statement: ""Though it has been over 18 years since he was taken from us, we still miss Daniel every day and the execution will in no way minimize our loss."""

That is up to 10C (50F) higher than the maximum average temperature for the South East for the time of year, and hotter than its is expected to be in Barcelona, where 22C (72F) is forecast and the October norm is 18C (64F). The balmy weather is thanks to scorching temperatures in the Mediterranean, with warm air from these areas hitting the South East on Friday. But not everywhere will bask in the Indian summer. Here's the latest expected track of ex-hurricane #Ophelia. Wind & rain in some western parts while the south east stays dry but breezy pic.twitter.com/Y30C6mX9bU Weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office and Met Éireann as the remnants of hurricane Ophelia are forecast to head to Ireland and the UK on Monday. The storm, which will be classed as an ex-hurricane when it lands, is expected to bring storm force winds to Ireland and the west of the UK. Southerly winds will likely gust between 50-60mph (80-97kph) across most of the west and strengths in excess of 70mph (113kph) are possible around exposed areas. As ex-hurricane #Ophelia approaches it's set to turn warmer into this weekend and Monday, but how warm? pic.twitter.com/TrcUqTx7Ne Very high seas are also likely and northwestern parts of the UK will possibly see heavy rain as well. Wind speeds of up to 60mph (97kph) are forecast for most of Northern Ireland, northern England and Scotland through Tuesday morning, along with more heavy rain. Gusts may even reach 70mph (113kph) across the central belt of Scotland and parts of northeast England and heavy rain is also possible for these areas, especially western Scotland. These conditions may result in some travel delays on Monday with spray on roads. Large waves could also cause delays for coastal routes. There may also be power cuts and maybe some damage to buildings. Ophelia will clear away northeastwards later on Tuesday leading to calmer, more typically autumnal conditions for the rest of the week. The storm hits the UK around the 30th anniversary of the great storm of 1987, which left 18 people dead and caused massive amounts of damage. Winds of up to 100mph (161kph) brought down around 15 million trees, blocking roads and railway lines, causing major transport delays. Others took down electricity and telephone lines, leaving thousands of homes without power for more than 24 hours."
2017-10-13,The Prime Minster has decided to go for it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171014055421/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-accelerates-into-brexit-tidal-wave-11074461,"A little like a captain of a ship facing a tidal wave, and realising the only way through is to accelerate into it. As expected, that meant the publication of outline plans for what No Deal would mean to our customs and trade system. This matters to Brexiteer ultras, but the more telling matter was that no money has been set aside, no land bought, no customs officers employed. It is a paper trade designed, by talking about No Deal, to avoid it ever happening. The Government did not sign up to the views of its former or current Cabinet ministers that No Deal would be perfectly fine. Instead, the PM did something really quite unexpected. She told Jacob Rees-Mogg, to his face, on the floor of the Commons that, yes, the European Court of Justice would be maintaining its jurisdiction during the transition phase. Officially, that is, until an alternative dispute resolution mechanism (an EFTA-type court for UK-EU) can be negotiated. In practice this will take at least two years. This may well have been the obvious implication of Mrs May's Florence speech, but it was not clearly stated, and the PM did not, for example, choose to clarify the same point in her Sky News interview last week. On Monday she did, choosing to dispense with the fudge, clear the fog, and try to get down to actual business. Mr Rees-Mogg was ""concerned"" and told Sky News that the PM had gone ""further than I wished her to go on ECJ jurisdiction during transition"". Bill Cash said MPs were keen to study the detail. Other Brexiteers said they were ""relaxed"" and could stomach the ECJ for another ""two years"". But this clearly crossed the private red lines of some Cabinet ministers, and the public ones expressed just before the Tory conference by Boris Johnson. No matter, the Foreign Secretary was soon to be found agreeing with the PM entirely on transition and agreeing with Michael Gove that the focus should be on the end state. Indeed Number 10 advisers say they have managed to convince all but a handful of MPs that she needs to focus all her ""negotiating capital not on a transition but on the end state"". It has, for now, worked. The PM has carried her Cabinet towards a position supporting a multi-year transition with full payments and ECJ jurisdiction. It may yet provide a few queasy moments in the Commons. The real question: will it unlock progress with the European Union? Perhaps it will create some goodwill that reaches ""sufficient progress"" by December. The question: whether her backbenchers will stomach more compromises on their pure ""clean Brexit"". So far it seems the PM calculates, as I argued last month, that her backbenchers will cash in their chips, and not risk their Brexit for No Brexit or a Corbyn Brexit. We want to save our negotiating capital for the end state."

Mr Trump savaged Iran's ""rogue regime"" in a speech at the White House, in which he also imposed extra sanctions on the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. He blamed Iran for spreading ""death, destruction and chaos all around the world"" and said it had committed multiple infringements of the deal. :: Trump thinks nuclear deal is only part of Iran problem Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, said the US leader's speech was full of ""baseless"" accusations against his country. Mr Trump's decision does not mean the pact will be scrapped - instead it will be forwarded to the US Congress. It will then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions or modify the laws on America's involvement in the pact, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA). ""We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence more terror and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakout,"" said President Trump. He said the deal had ""many flaws"" and warned: ""If we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated"". The President also used his speech to criticise Iran's non-nuclear activities, such as its ballistic missile programme, and said it had supported Syria's President Assad and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Mr Trump said Iran-backed attacks had killed many Americans over the years, and that the country had ""harboured terrorists"" after the 9/11 attacks. :: Analysis: Trump playing into hands of Iranian hardliners The original sanctions on Iran had included a freezing of financial assets, weapons sales and crude oil exports. Under the restrictions, the country lost more than a hundred billion dollars in oil revenue between 2012 and 2016 alone. On the implementation of the deal in January 2016, the White House said Iran had completed all steps to ensure its nuclear programme was exclusively peaceful. This included shipping 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium out of the country, and the dismantling and removing of two-thirds of its centrifuges, used to enrich uranium. Iranian leader Hassan Rouhani appeared on TV to say the multinational deal could not be revoked by one country. He said American would be isolated in its actions, and that Iran would redouble its efforts to expand its ballistic missile programme for defence. ""The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure... Iran and the deal are stronger than ever,"" said Mr Rouhani. Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also swiftly issued a joint statement. They said they were ""concerned by the possible implications"" and ""stand committed to the JCPoA and its full implementation by all sides"". ""The nuclear deal was the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran's nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes,"" the statement added. The leaders said they shared concerns about Iran's ballistic missile programme and had asked their foreign ministers to ""consider with the US how to take these issues forward"". Mr Macron said he had spoken to Mr Rouhani to assure him America's actions would not kill off the deal. Russia's foreign ministry also called on all sides to stick to the deal, saying Mr Trump's ""aggressive"" stance on Iran was doomed to fail. It said Tehran was sticking to its obligations and that there could be no renewal of the previous sanctions. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated President Trump for ""boldly confronting Iran's terrorist game"" and urged other countries to follow his lead. Saudi Arabia also welcomed the ""decisive strategy""."
2017-10-13,There's been an unpleasant crumpling of paper and packaging shares following a profits warning from Mondi.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171014055421/http://news.sky.com/story/mondi-profit-warning-sees-shares-in-paper-and-packaging-firm-crumple-11076462,"You may not have heard of this company but, courtesy of its membership of the FTSE 100, the chances are that you will indirectly own shares in it via tracker funds held by your life policy, pension fund or ISA. For Mondi is a business with a stock market value - even after the latest profit alert - of £10bn. And while its origins are in South Africa and its corporate headquarters are in Vienna, it operates out of no fewer than 40 locations in the UK, including manufacturing sites at Deeside, North Wales, Nelson in Lancashire and Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. It used to be bigger still in Britain, having until 2012 owned the newsprint supplier Aylesford, whose paper was used by titles including The Times, the Daily Mirror and The Observer. Previously part of Anglo American, the international mining giant, it was spun off as a separate business as its own right in 2007 and has spent most of the intervening period in the FTSE 100. It has not been a bad investment, either, with the shares delivering a 322% return during that period compared with one of just 20% from the FTSE All Share index. This has been bolstered by rapid growth in recent years following acquisitions in a number of countries and, in particular, emerging markets in Asia and central and Eastern Europe. During the last four years alone, Mondi has spent €1.6bn (£1.4bn) on acquisitions, with more deals promised. These, in theory, should be boom times for Mondi. Paper and packaging sounds relatively unglamorous as a business activity yet, as globalisation swells the ranks of the middle classes in markets like India and Turkey, more people are buying more things - and that means more paper and packaging. The rise of e-commerce in developed markets, meanwhile, has also created a demand for packaging. Accordingly, the company has grown full year operating profits from €547m in 2012 to €943m last year, with sales also rising solidly in that time. So what appears to have gone wrong now? Well, a couple of things. Firstly, the company has been caught out by currency issues, chiefly the US dollar - the weakest-performing major currency this year - and a fall in the Turkish lira. At the same time, input costs have also bitten, with Mondi citing higher wood, energy and chemical costs than in the same period last year. The price of recycled paper, which is being demanded by increasing numbers of customers for environmental reasons, was up 15% during the third quarter of the year from the corresponding period a year ago. There have also been closures, for maintenance, of some of the company's paper mills. The company added: ""Continuing cost pressures and negative currency impacts are expected to result in an underlying performance for the year modestly below market expectations."" That has been enough to send shares of Mondi down by nearly 8% and also drag down shares of other packaging firms, including Smurfit Kappa, the Irish packaging giant which is also in the FTSE 100 and DS Smith, the British group that sits just outside the index. Should investors panic? Probably not. Yes, sentiment in companies like this is always going to be influenced by short-term currency fluctuations and short-term price movements that - as has been seen - can blow profitability off-course for one or two quarters. Yet this is a company that, for many years, has enjoyed industry-beating returns and which is operating in an industry in which big is beautiful and which is consolidating. It is also operating in a sector where, as DS Smith has shown, innovation is prized by customers. Mondi recently bought Excelsior, a British business that has a reputation for coming up with bright ideas in food packaging, an area in which Mondi has previously not had much of a presence - but in which, with its strong global distribution, it could easily roll out innovative products and gain market share quickly. Those investors of a short-term persuasion may well have thrown their share certificates in the waste-paper basket. Others taking a longer-term view will keep them on their desk under the paper-weight."

It landed in a tree in Galloway Forest Park and was described as ""pretty intact"" on impact. The teacake was attached to a weather balloon for its journey, which was made possible by the Glasgow Science Centre. ""We are delighted by how many people joined us at GSC, and online, to watch Terry's space adventures,"" GSC chief executive Dr Stephen Breslin said. ""We engage people with space science every day, and we thought what better way to spark people's imaginations and interest in STEM than for us to launch something into space ourselves.""

Professor Davies warns antibiotic resistance can jeopardise everyday medical procedures and make them ""risky"" - including caesarean sections, cancer treatments and hip replacements. She also says without drugs to treat infections, transplant medicine would be a ""thing of the past"". Professor Davies told Sky News: ""The post-antibiotic apocalypse is that when you get an infection, we cannot guarantee it will be curable, treatable, so, conditions like routine operations will be a serious risk to life. ""Transplants and cancer treatments will be very risky. We already have deaths across the world because of drug-resistant infections, we cannot put up with this. ""I don't want to say to my children that I didn't do my best to protect them and their children."" The World Health Organisation says antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development today. Every year, about 700,000 people worldwide die from drug-resistant infections such as tuberculosis and malaria. What are antibiotics for? They are used to treat infections caused by bacteria, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia and gonorrhoea to name a few. Antibiotics do not treat viral infections such as the common cold, flu or chicken pox. When should antibiotics be used? Antibiotics should be used to treat bacterial infections. They kill bacteria and prevent them from spreading. I rarely take antibiotics, could I still be immune to them? Yes, because it is the bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics rather than the carrier. Why are infections becoming resistant to them? Although antibiotic resistance occurs naturally, it is being accelerated to dangerously high levels due to widespread misuse. Another contributing factor is that certain countries sell antibiotics over the counter without a prescription. What can you do to help prevent antibiotic resistance? WHO advises that individuals should only use antibiotics when they have been prescribed by a doctor and never demand them if your doctor says you do not need them. Never share or use leftover antibiotics and always follow your doctor's advice when they have been prescribed."

However, the services sector - which represents more than three-quarters of output and is traditionally the main driver of economic growth - remained static. Businesses in both sectors cited recruitment concerns. Nearly three-quarters of manufacturers reporting difficulties hiring workers, while the services sector said problems recruiting staff were at their highest level since early 2016. Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the survey results were ""uninspiring"" and ""reflect the fact that political uncertainty, currency fluctuations and the vagaries of the Brexit process are continuing to weigh on business growth prospects"". He said Chancellor Philip Hammond's autumn Budget provides ""a critical opportunity"" for the Government to ""take bold action"" to ""help the economy rebound from a period of anaemic growth"". Dr Marshall warned: ""A failure to act, or a conscious choice to provide a short-term sugar hit to the electorate rather than the protein boost the economy needs, would have significant consequences for the UK's medium-term growth prospects."" The BCC said it was ""extraordinary"" that the Bank of England is considering raising interest rates ""against this backdrop"". There was little sign in the survey of a pick-up in pay pressures or investment, both of which the BoE expects to rise markedly next year. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, said: ""We'd caution against an earlier than required tightening in monetary policy, which could hit both business and consumer confidence and weaken overall UK growth. ""While interest rates need to rise at some point, it should be done slowly and timed to not to harm the UK's growth prospects.""

2017-10-13,"The UK faces a tainted future of gridlock on the roads, railways and in the skies, as well as slower broadband and worse air quality, according to the man who advises the Government on infrastructure projects.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171014055421/http://news.sky.com/story/infrastructure-chief-lord-adonis-warns-uk-could-face-gridlocked-future-11077967,"Lord Adonis, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, says that ""for years, funding has been squeezed, policy decisions have been erratic and the network is showing signs of age and strain"". The commission will publish details on Friday of its draft report into the UK's infrastructure plans. The report will lay out the commission's views on what should be the UK's priorities for infrastructure planning between now and 2050. It will say that the country needs to address the problems of three Cs - congestion, capacity and carbon. ""Congestion is the single biggest problem facing Britain at the moment,"" Lord Adonis said in an interview with Sky News. ""Our roads, our railways, our digital systems, our mobile phone systems, they're all congested and we need to have congestion-busting measures so people can go about their jobs, go about their lives without constantly being disrupted by infrastructure that doesn't work. ""If we don't tackle that congestion, then this country will seize up, and it seizes up then there will be fewer jobs, we'll all be a lot poorer and no one will thank the politicians of this generation."" The report has identified the ""most serious infrastructure failing of all"" as the ""endless delay to a Parliamentary decision"" over building a third runway at Heathrow Airport. ""There is no space for new flights at Heathrow, which means no space to make fresh connections to important new markets, so the commission says 'get on with It',"" said Adonis. ""Heathrow is our most important port and it is effectively closed to new markets. ""We've spent 13 years talking about a new runway - it's now time to get on with it and open by the mid 2020s."" John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow, told Sky News that the airport had ""learnt lessons"" from its history of lobbying for a third runway. ""In the past we were guilty of overlooking issues such as local communities and environmental impact, and instead concentrating on the economic case. Now we've changed our approach. ""It's great that people like the infrastructure commission are now saying 'get on with it', and asking the Government why they haven't done this. ""That pull-through will help to make sure that, this time, it gets delivered."" As well as Lord Adonis, the commission includes a number of prominent businessmen, economists and infrastructure specialist. The deputy chair is Sir John Armitt, former chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority. The commission's report will say that the huge costs of some infrastructure projects are worth paying because of the economic rewards they generate in return. As well as investment to upgrade the existing transport infrastructure, its most prominent demands will be to call for huge investment in a 5G mobile phone network and also a national ""smart charging"" system for electric cars. At the moment, there are fears that a dramatic uptake in the use of electric vehicles could overburden the national grid. Other suggestions will be for more house building, improved flood protection, better heating for homes and inner-city public transport."

Shortly before midnight on Friday 29 September, she was spotted on CCTV being carried by a man on Cambridge Heath Road. The pair appeared to go into a doorway on the same road, after which the man was not seen again on camera. Items of the girl's clothing were found nearby. A short time later, another CCTV camera showed the girl stumbling along Mint Street being followed by a bearded man on a racing bicycle. Officers said the man followed her as she headed towards Bethnal Green Overground station. When she was next spotted, the man had approached her and they had reached Corfield Street. Some time later, the camera captured the man leaving the area and walking away. The girl, with dishevelled clothing, emerged shortly afterwards and walked along Corfield Street. Minutes later, at about 12.45am, the victim is thought to have suffered a third attack - possibly involving two or three men. A third, different man was seen walking down Corfield Street and joining two other figures under some trees. He appeared to bend down towards a spot on the kerb between some parked cars. Detectives believe it was at this point that the victim was sexually assaulted. A member of the public found the teenager lying on the ground in a state of distress and called 999. Officers believe it is possible that she was drugged, and toxicology tests have been carried out. Detective Inspector Suzanne Jordan said: ""This is a horrific multiple sexual assault on a young female who was simply making her way home after a night out. ""We would like to thank the members of the public who intervened to help her and possibly prevented her ordeal from continuing even further. ""We believe two of the three were very serious sexual assaults indeed, and are determined to catch the persons responsible for these hideous crimes."" :: Anyone with information should call police on 101, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or contact @MetCC on Twitter."

The work was expected to be completed in the first few months of 2018, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) said. White protective wrapping will start appearing around the scaffolding from Saturday. The first five floors are expected to be covered by the end of next week, a spokesman for the borough said. Then the material will go up at the pace of one week per floor. :: Grenfell Tower fire - who are the victims? The scaffold structure is already in place up to the 18th floor on the 24-storey building's east face and at the fifth floor on the other three sides. The June 14 tragedy, which also left hundreds homeless, triggered the launch of a public inquiry and a large criminal investigation. According to some mental health professionals, the charred remains of the tower might be worsening the trauma for those living nearby. Survivors of the fire will be offered the chance to settle permanently in the UK, the Government said this week. The tower is earmarked for demolition towards the end of next year, but police are still searching through the remains for evidence. Recovery workers are also removing bags of the debris which was expelled from the structure and piled up on the ground. Lorries have been drafted in to help remove the loose wreckage, which will be taken to a secure depot and stored in metal containers, the Grenfell Response Team said."

In 2015, the charity received 27 reports of this kind of abuse being shared on Snapchat, but a year later that had shot up to 69. So far this year 119 complaints (a rise of 340%) have been reported and there are still three months of the year left. ""It's as shocking as it is disturbing and what's really saddening is that this abuse is mostly being committed by children,"" an RSPCA intelligence researcher, who works covertly to gather evidence for prosecutions, told Sky News. ""These children are then sharing the videos and pictures with their peers. Some days it's very difficult to get those images out of my head."" Some of the images passed to Sky News by the RSPCA were too disturbing to broadcast. When the charity receives the material it works diligently to find out where it was filmed - and by whom - before then contacting schools, teachers and parents. At the Hopefield Animal Sanctuary in Brentwood, staff are still reeling after intruders broke in and abused some of their animals in August. ""We've had three cases of people breaking in,"" said manager Lianne Angliss. ""We were alerted by a supporter who had seen on Snapchat that someone had come down and grabbed Nathan, one of our goats, by the horns and pulled him onto the electric fence. ""She sent us that picture. ""There was another video where they pushed one of the pigs over and scared the horses. ""The lady that sent them to us just screenshotted them, as most people know Snapchat is not forever, so we would have been unable to get the footage. ""Nathan is a little bit subdued, he'd normally come up and say hello. ""He's not coming up so much now, he's probably scared to death."" So why has the number of incidents being reported risen so dramatically in such a short space of time? ""For some people it will be sinister and they will want to relive the event over and over again,"" said Dr Pam Ramsden, a psychology lecturer at the University of Bradford. ""Other people who will do it are trying to impress people with how cruel they can be. People have always done this. The difference now is that they can show a wider audience, as opposed to two or three lads doing something terrible, they can show a group of 20 people at the pub."" In a statement, Snapchat said: ""This sort of cruelty is illegal and should never be broadcast on Snapchat. We encourage anyone who sees something like this anywhere to always report it."""

The 57-year-old has received a phone call from the market authorities and now has a meeting with a manager. The mugs at the centre of the row feature a medieval knight and the Christian chivalric order's Latin motto, which translates as: ""Not to us Lord, not to us, but to your name give the glory"". The mugs brought one complaint. When market authorities received the complaint, Ms Gayle refused to remove them from sale. She was handed a letter on 6 October stating she was in breach of Charnwood Council's trading terms and conditions and had to leave her pitch at the market. The council now says it had ""got this one wrong"", and has apologised for the way it handled the matter. In a statement, it said: ""We did receive a complaint because someone was offended by the mugs, but we do not find the mugs offensive. ""Our main issue was that it is a vintage market and these items were new when we only want vintage or used items on sale."" Ms Gayle, from Didcot, Oxfordshire, who also sells Second World War vintage books, said she was ""appreciative"" of the council's change of approach and hopeful she might get her pitch back. Ms Gayle said she had been told the council ""had a complaint that the mugs might be offensive to Muslims"". She added: ""The person who complained wasn't offended himself, but thought Muslims might be. ""I've never had a Muslim come into my stall and say they were offended by the mugs."""

She said: ""The next thing I knew he was half undressed and he grabbed me. ""It was the last thing I expected and I fled."" But Weinstein then started stalking her, she told the paper, turning up at her home. She said: ""He pushed me inside and rammed me against the coat rack.

2017-10-14,The Prime Minster has decided to go for it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171015063433/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-accelerates-into-brexit-tidal-wave-11074461,"A little like a captain of a ship facing a tidal wave, and realising the only way through is to accelerate into it. As expected, that meant the publication of outline plans for what No Deal would mean to our customs and trade system. This matters to Brexiteer ultras, but the more telling matter was that no money has been set aside, no land bought, no customs officers employed. It is a paper trade designed, by talking about No Deal, to avoid it ever happening. The Government did not sign up to the views of its former or current Cabinet ministers that No Deal would be perfectly fine. Instead, the PM did something really quite unexpected. She told Jacob Rees-Mogg, to his face, on the floor of the Commons that, yes, the European Court of Justice would be maintaining its jurisdiction during the transition phase. Officially, that is, until an alternative dispute resolution mechanism (an EFTA-type court for UK-EU) can be negotiated. In practice this will take at least two years. This may well have been the obvious implication of Mrs May's Florence speech, but it was not clearly stated, and the PM did not, for example, choose to clarify the same point in her Sky News interview last week. On Monday she did, choosing to dispense with the fudge, clear the fog, and try to get down to actual business. Mr Rees-Mogg was ""concerned"" and told Sky News that the PM had gone ""further than I wished her to go on ECJ jurisdiction during transition"". Bill Cash said MPs were keen to study the detail. Other Brexiteers said they were ""relaxed"" and could stomach the ECJ for another ""two years"". But this clearly crossed the private red lines of some Cabinet ministers, and the public ones expressed just before the Tory conference by Boris Johnson. No matter, the Foreign Secretary was soon to be found agreeing with the PM entirely on transition and agreeing with Michael Gove that the focus should be on the end state. Indeed Number 10 advisers say they have managed to convince all but a handful of MPs that she needs to focus all her ""negotiating capital not on a transition but on the end state"". It has, for now, worked. The PM has carried her Cabinet towards a position supporting a multi-year transition with full payments and ECJ jurisdiction. It may yet provide a few queasy moments in the Commons. The real question: will it unlock progress with the European Union? Perhaps it will create some goodwill that reaches ""sufficient progress"" by December. The question: whether her backbenchers will stomach more compromises on their pure ""clean Brexit"". So far it seems the PM calculates, as I argued last month, that her backbenchers will cash in their chips, and not risk their Brexit for No Brexit or a Corbyn Brexit. We want to save our negotiating capital for the end state."

Mrs Leadsom told The Sunday Times: ""Some people might think this is a trivial matter - but over the course of the repairs, we have a duty to uphold the huge appeal of Big Ben to the millions of tourists that visit it each year. ""I'm sure visitors to the Eiffel Tower or Taj Mahal would be incredibly disappointed if they were covered in scaffolding - the same is true of Elizabeth Tower.""

The 13.7-tonne Great Bell was last stopped for maintenance in 2007 and before that it was halted for two years in 1983 for refurbishment. The current Elizabeth Tower renovation was originally estimated at £29m last year but it is now expected to cost around £61m. In August, hundreds of people gathered to watch Big Ben fall silent for controversial renovations that will last four years, the longest period in its 157-year history.

Minimum sentences were introduced for those aged 16 and over who are convicted of a second or subsequent offence of possession of a knife or offensive weapon. The punishment is at least six months' imprisonment, which can include suspended terms, for adults, while young offenders face a minimum four-month detention and training order. Judges must impose the minimum sentence unless there are particular circumstances relating to the latest offence, the previous offence or the offender which would ""make it unjust to do so in all the circumstances"". A new offence to stop the sale of acids and the most harmful corrosive substances to under-18s is also being considered. Police figures show there were 408 attacks using corrosive substances between November 2016 and April this year. ""The use of corrosive substances as a weapon is centuries old, but whilst the number of offences is relatively small, we are concerned about its increasing use as a weapon,"" the document says.

The appeal judges said the school's policy caused detriment and less favourable treatment for both sets of pupils because of their sex. As a result, it was found to be contrary to the 2010 Equality Act. The ruling overturns last year's finding by a High Court judge that Ofsted inspectors were wrong to penalise the co-educational school for separating students. Following the ruling, Ofsted's chief inspector Amanda Spielman said: ""I am delighted that we have won this appeal. ""The school is teaching boys and girls entirely separately, making them walk down separate corridors, and keeping them apart at all times. ""This is discrimination and is wrong. It places these boys and girls at a disadvantage for life beyond the classroom and the workplace, and fails to prepare them for life in modern Britain."" The school believes that total separation of the sexes from Year 5 onwards is necessary for religious reasons. Children at the school between the ages of nine and 16 are separated for all their lessons, breaks, clubs and school trips. During the appeal hearing, the school's lawyer said boys and girls at the school were ""treated entirely equally while segregated"". He argued that the policy at al Hijrah, which is maintained by Birmingham City Council, was lawful. But the school's argument that ""separate but equal treatment by reason of gender cannot be unlawful discrimination, even it it is detrimental"" was rejected by the judges. The ruling will have implications for other schools that segregate pupils based on their sex. The appeal judges noted that: ""The school is not the only Islamic school which operates such a policy and that a number of Jewish schools with a particular Orthodox ethos and some Christian faith schools have similar practices."" They said Ofsted had main it clear that they would apply a ""consistent approach to all similarly organised schools"". Ms Spielman said Ofsted will be ""considering the ruling carefully to understand how this will affect future inspections"". A Department for Education spokesperson said they welcomed the Court of Appeal's judgement. They said the ruling ""supports the department's long-standing position that mixed schools should only separate children by gender in very limited circumstances where this can be justified and they can demonstrate that no pupil is disadvantaged by virtue of their gender""."

That is up to 10C (50F) higher than the maximum average temperature for the South East for the time of year, and hotter than its is expected to be in Barcelona, where 22C (72F) is forecast and the October norm is 18C (64F). The balmy weather is thanks to scorching temperatures in the Mediterranean, but not everywhere will bask in the Indian summer. Here's the latest expected track of ex-hurricane #Ophelia. Wind & rain in some western parts while the south east stays dry but breezy pic.twitter.com/Y30C6mX9bU Weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office and Met Éireann as the remnants of hurricane Ophelia are forecast to head to Ireland and the UK on Monday. The storm, which will be classed as an ex-hurricane when it lands, is expected to bring storm force winds to Ireland and the west of the UK. Southerly winds will likely gust between 50-60mph (80-97kph) across most of the west and strengths in excess of 70mph (113kph) are possible around exposed areas. As ex-hurricane #Ophelia approaches it's set to turn warmer into this weekend and Monday, but how warm? pic.twitter.com/TrcUqTx7Ne Very high seas are also likely and northwestern parts of the UK will possibly see heavy rain as well. Wind speeds of up to 60mph (97kph) are forecast for most of Northern Ireland, northern England and Scotland through Tuesday morning, along with more heavy rain. Gusts may even reach 70mph (113kph) across the central belt of Scotland and parts of northeast England and heavy rain is also possible for these areas, especially western Scotland. These conditions may result in some travel delays on Monday with spray on roads. Large waves could also cause delays for coastal routes. There may also be power cuts and maybe some damage to buildings. Ophelia will clear away northeastwards later on Tuesday leading to calmer, more typically autumnal conditions for the rest of the week. The storm hits the UK around the 30th anniversary of the great storm of 1987, which left 18 people dead and caused massive amounts of damage. Winds of up to 100mph (161kph) brought down around 15 million trees, blocking roads and railway lines, causing major transport delays. Others took down electricity and telephone lines, leaving thousands of homes without power for more than 24 hours."

""I think everyone thinks she's sincere, in love and doing her job to the best of her ability."" Goldsmith was brought up with his sister in Southall, west London. Their mother worked in a shop and also did accounts, while their father was a painter and decorator."
2017-10-14,"A hard border is inevitable if Britain leaves the customs union and politicians need to stop ""sugarcoating"" the truth, Ireland's main opposition leader has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171015063433/http://news.sky.com/story/micheal-martin-brexit-makes-hard-irish-border-inevitable-11081416,"Speaking to Sky News, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin also attacked Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for his ""unhelpful"" rhetoric and for misleading the British public. Mr Martin said: ""The implications for the peace process are very real, and extremely damaging for the economic and social fabric of the island of Ireland. ""I think politicians have been over-doing the sugarcoating. ""Talking about frictionless borders - language that is incompatible with a hard border and Britain outside the customs union, you cannot have both."" On the Foreign Secretary, Mr Martin said: ""I think there is a time, when you are in public office, that you need to talk sense to the people and not consistently play political games."" Asked whether he was misleading the British public, the Fianna Fail leader replied: ""I think he has. He's not telling it straight. ""The whole idea of Britain going off and having free trade agreements with the rest of the world and doing this, that and the other."" It comes as a report by Irish authorities, published on Saturday, warned that the current open border is not sustainable if Britain leaves the customs union. The report concludes that staffing and infrastructure will have to be significantly increased and that upwards of eight customs checks and visible border controls may be required. Mr Martin also said Brexit would be a danger to Anglo-Irish relations. ""It is at risk, whether people want it to be at risk or not - and I don't think people do,"" he said. ""Let's not pretend. If Britain moves out of the European Union we are going down different paths and that will be particularly difficult for the north of Ireland. ""There are very serious dangers down the road in terms of Britain and Ireland going down divergent routes."" While Fianna Fail are currently in a supply and confidence deal with the Republic's minority government, they are hoping to get back into power at the next election - which some predict might come as early as next year."
2017-10-14,Uber is appealing against Transport for London's decision to deny it a new private hire licence for operating in the capital.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171015063433/http://news.sky.com/story/uber-lodges-appeal-to-overturn-london-ban-11078747,"The ride hailing service filed papers with Westminster magistrates court on Friday to start the process - hours before the deadline. It has pledged to ""make things right"" since TfL's refusal last month to renew Uber's licence on the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"". The firm's approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers were cited among the concerns. An Uber spokesman said: ""While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. ""As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right."" Talks in the capital earlier this month between the company's new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi and transport commissioner Mike Brown were described by both sides as ""constructive"". Uber, which was licensed as a private hire company in London in 2012, has about 40,000 drivers in London and is used by 3.5 million people. It had until 13 October to appeal the decision and can continue to operate until the end of any appeal process. The company, which has been valued at almost $70bn, has been in turmoil in recent months over the conduct and subsequent exit of its founder, Travis Kalanick. Its expansion has been blighted by regulatory and legal complications worldwide, including wrangles over the employment rights of its drivers in the UK. The firm claims it is an agent for drivers - not an employer - and therefore does not need to offer benefits. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has accused Uber of not ""playing by the rules"". The company has accepted ""that in lots of places it has had the wrong attitude and needs to change""."

Around 33,000 people watched a livestream of the event on Facebook. They witnessed the teacake gliding over the curve of planet earth, the sun peeking from the darkness of space, before falling back through the atmosphere. It landed in a tree in Galloway Forest Park and was described as ""pretty intact"" on impact. The teacake was attached to a weather balloon for its journey, which was made possible by the Glasgow Science Centre. ""We are delighted by how many people joined us at GSC, and online, to watch Terry's space adventures,"" GSC chief executive Dr Stephen Breslin said. ""We engage people with space science every day, and we thought what better way to spark people's imaginations and interest in STEM than for us to launch something into space ourselves."" To demonstrate the conditions of outer space, scientists subjected teacakes to several training exercises. The snack was placed in liquid nitrogen to simulate freezing temperatures, kept in an airless jar similar to a low-pressure, high-altitude environment, and melted with a blowtorch. Glasgow Science Centre described the variety of teacake as ""Scotland's favourite snack""."

They believe the pair may be together and could have got on a bus travelling towards Falkirk. Leah was last seen in Gauze Street, Paisley, on Friday at around 9.10am, while Jasmine left her home in Sandy Road, Renfrew, at around 3pm that day. Jasmine is around 5ft 6ins tall with a slim build. She has brown wavy hair and blue eyes and was wearing a black puffer jacket and black skinny jeans. Leah has a similar height and build and has long brown hair. She was wearing black leggings, a grey long-sleeved shirt, black trainers, a black parka jacket with a fur-lined hood, and she was carrying a camouflage print bag. Police said a number of inquiries are being carried out to find the girls, with officers in Falkirk also checking for any sightings of them. Inspector Steven Espie said: ""We are growing increasingly concerned for the girls given their age and that fact that no-one has heard from them. ""We are checking relevant CCTV footage for any additional information and we are appealing to anyone who may have seen the girls to contact us. ""We believe they may have got on a bus and travelled to Falkirk and we are undertaking inquiries to ascertain if that is the case.""

2017-10-14,A plane chartered by the French military to transport goods for an anti-jihadist operation has crashed into the sea off Ivory Coast.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171015063433/http://news.sky.com/story/french-military-plane-crashes-on-take-off-in-ivory-coast-11080114,"Four people, all from Moldova, died, and a further six, some of whom are French nationals, were injured. The Antonov propeller cargo plane came down close to the beach shortly after taking off from Abidjan airport some time around 10am UK time. A French military source said the Antonov was being used as part of Operation Barkhane, the ongoing effort to tackle Islamist insurgencies across the African Sahel. More than 4,000 troops are spread throughout former French colonies of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, with the force headquartered in Chad. The French military base in the capital of Ivory Coast, itself a former French colony, provides logistical support for the operation. Pictures showed the plane wreckage, broken into pieces, scattered in the shallow waters. People living nearby attached ropes to the aircraft in an attempt to salvage some of the equipment on board. The injured were taken to the Port-Bouet camp in Abidjan for treatment, the spokesman for French forces in Ivory Coast said. Student Ange Koutaye Ismael, 19, said he was at home when he noticed a plane flying low over his neighbourhood. When he heard a plane had come down on the beach, he ran down to capture the scene on camera. He believed stormy weather probably played a role in the crash. ""There was winds yesterday and I saw how planes seemed to have difficulties in getting up,"" he said."

Returning to the scene, Mr Quilliam explained he was trying to ""kiss the fish"" - an angling tradition to thank the catch before throwing it back, when his plan backfired. The angler, who has made a full recovery, suffering no ill effects, told Sky News he ""unhooked it, picked it up off the floor and went to give it a kiss before I threw it back."" ""Imagine you squeeze a bar of soap, or a tube of toothpaste, and basically it jumped out of my hand, into my mouth and swam straight down my throat,"" he said. ""It was literally a split second it had happened and I was completely choked out."" Paramedic Matt Harrison, of the South West Ambulance Service (SWAS), who arrived within minutes to find his friends giving Mr Quilliam CPR after he had collapsed and stopped breathing. He admitted he struggled to grasp what had happened. ""We didn't really know the size of the fish we were aiming to retrieve. Although they were saying 'he swallowed a fish, he swallowed a fish', when you're actually hearing that and trying to absorb that and looking at the person on the floor, it seems almost unbelievable,"" he said. The paramedics managed to restore his pulse after discovering his heart had stopped, but despite using artificial ventilation could not get oxygen into his lungs. Realising time was very short, Mr Harrison used a laryngoscope to fully extend the mouth and a pair of forceps to ""dislodge the tip of the tail"". ""Very carefully, so as not to break the tail off, I tried to remove it, although the fish's barbs and gills were getting stuck on the way back up,"" explained Mr Harrison. ""Eventually after six attempts the fish came out in one piece and to our amazement it was a whole Dover sole, measuring approximately 14cm in length."" Sam, who admits he has little memory of the incident and feels lucky to be alive, suffered no lasting effects and has made a full recovery. ""I have never attended a more bizarre incident and don't think I ever will,"" Mr Harrison said."

The group - which includes names such as Tom Hanks, Annette Bening and Steven Spielberg - said in a statement they had ""voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority to immediately expel him from the Academy"". :: Harvey Weinstein's accusers, critics and defenders The more than 8,000-member group said the film producer, who has been accused of sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape by dozens of women, ""does not merit the respect of his colleagues"". :: Hollywood's PR machine and its secret scandal The statement added that the Academy wanted ""to send a message that the era of wilful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behaviour and workplace harassment in our industry is over"". Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" allegations of non-consensual sex against him and of illegal sexual harassment. British actress Lysette Anthony has become the fifth woman to accuse the 65-year-old of raping her. She joined a long list of actresses and women who have worked with Weinstein in the past, who claim he behaved inappropriately towards them. These include A-listers such as Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale. Police forces in the UK and US are investigating the allegations. :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's infamous casting couch Weinstein, who is believed to have checked into rehab, was fired last Sunday by The Weinstein Company - the studio he co-founded with his brother Bob. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Bob Weinstein said: ""I don't feel an ounce of remorse coming from him, and that kills me, too. ""It's unbelievable that even to this moment he is more concerned with who sold him out. ""I don't hear concern or contrition for the victims. And I want them to hear that. Harvey has no remorse whatsoever."" Bob and Harvey Weinstein have worked together since they co-founded Miramax in the late 1970s, but the younger sibling says the two have been ""divorced"" for the last five years. He has also been left by his wife and suspended by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta). Also meeting to discuss the scandal is the Producers' Guild of America, which will ""consider disciplinary proceedings and the status of (Weinstein's) membership"". The meetings come after Casino Royale actress Eva Green said she felt ""shocked and disgusted"" after an encounter with Weinstein in which she allegedly had to ""push him off"". Green's statement came after her mother, Marlene Jobert, told a French radio that her daughter ""was a victim of this horrible man"". Sky News has reached out to representatives of Mr Weinstein, but they have yet to comment."
2017-10-14,A man held hostage in Afghanistan with his family for years has said his infant daughter was killed and his wife raped by their captors.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171015063433/http://news.sky.com/story/ex-hostage-says-taliban-linked-extremists-killed-baby-daughter-11079748,"The couple and their children were freed by a Pakistani military operation and returned to Canada on Friday. Joshua Boyle, a Canadian, and his wife Caitlan Coleman, from Pennsylvania, were kidnapped while on a trip in Afghanistan's Wardak province in 2012. Ms Coleman, 31, was pregnant at the time and gave birth to four children while being held prisoner by the Haqqani network, a group linked to the Taliban. Their eventual rescue was carried out by Pakistani forces on a tip from US intelligence. The couple arrived with three children, one of whom had suffered a ""medical emergency"", according to Mr Boyle, in the aftermath of what reports said was a gun battle in Pakistan on Wednesday. Speaking at Toronto Airport, Mr Boyle, 34, said the family's captors killed their baby daughter and raped his wife. He told reporters: ""I was in Afghanistan helping the most neglected minority group in the world, those ordinary villagers who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where no NGO, no aid worker and no government has ever successfully been able to bring the necessary help. ""The stupidity and evil of the Haqqani network's kidnapping of a pilgrim and his heavily pregnant wife engaged in helping ordinary villagers in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan was eclipsed only by the stupidity and evil of authorising the murder of my infant daughter."" While on their flight from London to Toronto on Friday, Mr Boyle gave a written statement to the Associated Press explaining their motivation. He wrote: ""God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organised injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege."" He told a reporter on the plane that the ""(US State Department's) interests are not my interests"". Jim Coleman, father of Caitlan, criticised Mr Boyle for taking her to Afghanistan when she was pregnant. He told ABC News: ""Taking your pregnant wife to a very dangerous place, to me, and the kind of person that I am, it's unconscionable."" Mr Boyle is reported to have told his parents that the operation to free the family involved a shootout and ended with a threat from one of their captors to ""kill the hostage"". The Canadian, his wife and their children were intercepted by Pakistani forces while being transported in the back of their captors' car. His family said some of his captors were killed and Mr Boyle suffered a shrapnel wound. Meanwhile, Mr Boyle denied reports he had had refused to board a plane that was preparing to take the family home. Speaking in Toronto, he said: ""I assure you I have never refused to board any mode of transportation that would bring me closer to home, closer to Canada and back with my family. ""Obviously it will be of incredible importance to my family that we are able to build a secure sanctuary for our three surviving children to call home, to focus on edification and to try to regain some portion of the childhood that they have lost."" Mr Boyle was previously married to the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay prisoner Omar Khadr. She was the daughter of a senior al Qaeda financier and friend of Osama bin Laden. They divorced in 2010. Officials have dismissed any link between his previous marriage and the family's capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a ""horrible coincidence."" The US Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman is wanted for any federal crime. While the family were being held, the Haqqani network demanded the release of the son of its founder in exchange for turning them over and released several videos in which Mr Boyle pleaded with the Afghan authorities."
2017-10-14,Britons are being urged to spend their old £1 coins or deposit them in banks as they will no longer be legal tender from midnight on Sunday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171015063433/http://news.sky.com/story/deadline-looms-for-britons-to-spend-old-1-coins-11079994,"But people should not panic if they miss the 15 October deadline as major banks and building societies and some big stores are giving them extra time to use them. After Sunday night, the round £1 coins will no longer be in circulation and members of the public have been returning them at a rate of up to 60 million per week. However, around 400 to 450 million are still lying around in wallets, pockets and down the back of sofas. NatWest said there has been big rise in the number of its customers offloading their old round pounds. In the first week of October the bank received 34.5 million coins, compared to just over 24 million over a week in September. And they were not just limited to one pound coins as people deposited their loose change. NatWest said more than 5.5 million pound coins were handed in through coin machines, an increase of two million compared with the normal weekly average. The new 12-sided pound coin went into circulation in March and has new high-tech security features designed to thwart counterfeiters. :: Everything you need to know about the new pound The Iceland and Poundland stores have said they will continue to accept the old round pound until 31 October. And Tesco has said it will continue accepting the old-style coins for a week after the 15 October deadline. People can also deposit them into their bank accounts via the Post Office."
2017-10-14,There's been an unpleasant crumpling of paper and packaging shares following a profits warning from Mondi.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171015063433/http://news.sky.com/story/mondi-profit-warning-sees-shares-in-paper-and-packaging-firm-crumple-11076462,"You may not have heard of this company but, courtesy of its membership of the FTSE 100, the chances are that you will indirectly own shares in it via tracker funds held by your life policy, pension fund or ISA. For Mondi is a business with a stock market value - even after the latest profit alert - of £10bn. And while its origins are in South Africa and its corporate headquarters are in Vienna, it operates out of no fewer than 40 locations in the UK, including manufacturing sites at Deeside, North Wales, Nelson in Lancashire and Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. It used to be bigger still in Britain, having until 2012 owned the newsprint supplier Aylesford, whose paper was used by titles including The Times, the Daily Mirror and The Observer. Previously part of Anglo American, the international mining giant, it was spun off as a separate business as its own right in 2007 and has spent most of the intervening period in the FTSE 100. It has not been a bad investment, either, with the shares delivering a 322% return during that period compared with one of just 20% from the FTSE All Share index. This has been bolstered by rapid growth in recent years following acquisitions in a number of countries and, in particular, emerging markets in Asia and central and Eastern Europe. During the last four years alone, Mondi has spent €1.6bn (£1.4bn) on acquisitions, with more deals promised. These, in theory, should be boom times for Mondi. Paper and packaging sounds relatively unglamorous as a business activity yet, as globalisation swells the ranks of the middle classes in markets like India and Turkey, more people are buying more things - and that means more paper and packaging. The rise of e-commerce in developed markets, meanwhile, has also created a demand for packaging. Accordingly, the company has grown full year operating profits from €547m in 2012 to €943m last year, with sales also rising solidly in that time. So what appears to have gone wrong now? Well, a couple of things. Firstly, the company has been caught out by currency issues, chiefly the US dollar - the weakest-performing major currency this year - and a fall in the Turkish lira. At the same time, input costs have also bitten, with Mondi citing higher wood, energy and chemical costs than in the same period last year. The price of recycled paper, which is being demanded by increasing numbers of customers for environmental reasons, was up 15% during the third quarter of the year from the corresponding period a year ago. There have also been closures, for maintenance, of some of the company's paper mills. The company added: ""Continuing cost pressures and negative currency impacts are expected to result in an underlying performance for the year modestly below market expectations."" That has been enough to send shares of Mondi down by nearly 8% and also drag down shares of other packaging firms, including Smurfit Kappa, the Irish packaging giant which is also in the FTSE 100 and DS Smith, the British group that sits just outside the index. Should investors panic? Probably not. Yes, sentiment in companies like this is always going to be influenced by short-term currency fluctuations and short-term price movements that - as has been seen - can blow profitability off-course for one or two quarters. Yet this is a company that, for many years, has enjoyed industry-beating returns and which is operating in an industry in which big is beautiful and which is consolidating. It is also operating in a sector where, as DS Smith has shown, innovation is prized by customers. Mondi recently bought Excelsior, a British business that has a reputation for coming up with bright ideas in food packaging, an area in which Mondi has previously not had much of a presence - but in which, with its strong global distribution, it could easily roll out innovative products and gain market share quickly. Those investors of a short-term persuasion may well have thrown their share certificates in the waste-paper basket. Others taking a longer-term view will keep them on their desk under the paper-weight."

""When I arrived I was relieved to find another woman in his room and thought immediately I was safe. ""He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction.

""This behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable."" Anonymous A woman who did not wish to be named told The New Yorker that he summoned her to a hotel where he was staying and raped her. Green said she had not discussed the case before because she wanted to maintain her privacy, but had decided to speak out as other women share their stories and risk having ""their personal reputations tarnished by association"". Green praised what she said was the bravery of these women and said: ""The exploitation of power is ubiquitous. ""This behaviour is unacceptable and needs to be eliminated."" The scandal broke out when The New York TImes published an expose last week. Since then, around 30 women, including Kate Beckinsale, Cara Delevingne, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have said Weinstein has sexually harassed or assaulted them. :: Hollywood elite to discuss kicking out disgraced producer Weinstein The New Yorker has also published allegations of rape from three women. Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" allegations of non-consensual sex against him and of illegal sexual harassment. He was fired last Sunday by The Weinstein Company, the studio he co-founded with his brother Bob, and has been left by his wife. He is believed to have checked into rehab. Tom Hanks, Actor ""Look, I don't want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can't buy, 'Oh, well, I grew up in the '60s and '70s and so therefore' - I did, too. So I think it's like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can."" Ryan Gosling, Actor ""I want to add my voice of support for the women who have had the courage to speak out against Harvey Weinstein. Like most people in Hollywood, I have worked with him and I'm deeply disappointed in myself for being so oblivious to these devastating experiences of sexual harassment and abuse. He is emblematic of a systemic problem. Men should stand with women and work together until there is real accountability and change."" Colin Farrell, Actor ""I'm just watching it unfold and then tearing myself away from it and realising the horribleness of it all and the wrongdoing, fundamentally, around the whole thing and just wish healing for everyone and that changes are made. I hope anyone who was hurt that they have healing. It's just atrocious, really."" Emma Thompson, Actress ""I don't think you can describe him as a sex addict. He's a predator - that's different. He's at the top of, as it were, the ladder of, a system of harassment and belittlement and bullying and interference. This has been part of our world, women's world, since time immemorial."" Carey Mulligan, Actress ""Thank God it's all coming out, it's horrific. And thank God it's coming to the fore and these incredible women are feeling brave enough to be able to come forward and say something about it."" Colin Firth, Actor ""She told me she had had a distressing encounter with Harvey Weinstein,"" Firth told the Guardian about one of the accusers, Sophie Dix. ""I don't think she went into all the horrific detail I've read in her interview. But I remember her being profoundly upset by it. To my shame, I merely expressed sympathy. I didn't act on what she told me. It was a long time ago and I don't know if she remembers telling me, but the fact that I had that conversation has come back to haunt me in the light of these revelations. It's the only direct account of this kind of behaviour by Harvey Weinstein that's ever been told to me."" Kelly MacDonald, Actress ""He needs to be locked up - that's the main thing. He seems to have behaved in a way that you would think that's the very least that should happen."" Paris Hilton, Socialite ""Growing up in Hollywood I've experienced that a lot. I think when someone is in power then they are able to do that - so I think it's really brave of these women to be speaking out and to start a movement to stop this. Because it happens way too often."" Anette Bening, Actress ""Perhaps now that this has been uncovered, things will change. Maybe men will understand things better and young women as well. It is very, very important that they spoke out."" James Van Der Beek, Actor ""For anyone judging the women who stayed silent, read this for perspective. Also for anyone brushing off harassment as 'boys being boys'. What Weinstein is being accused of is criminal. What he's admitted to is unacceptable - in any industry. I applaud everybody speaking out. I've had my ass grabbed by older, powerful men, I've had them corner me ininappropriate sexual conversations when I was much younger... I understand the unwarranted shame, powerlessness & inability to blow the whistle. There's a power dynamic that feels impossible to overcome."" Ewan McGregor, Actor ""It's about time this came to light and he is getting just deserts. Heard rumours over the years but this is awful. Bye Bully!"" Brie Larson, Actress ""As always, I stand with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment. It's not your fault. I believe you."" Jeff Bridges, Actor ""Talk about facing your fear, he's gotta face his demons now. I wish him the best of luck with that, he needs to lean in and really face those things."" Benedict Cumberbatch, Actor ""I am utterly disgusted by the continuing revelations of Harvey Weinstein's horrifying and unforgivable actions. We need to collectively stand up and support victims of abuse such as the brave and inspiring women who have spoken out against him and say we hear you and believe you. That way others may be emboldened by our support to come forward and speak. But we shouldn't wait until there are any more stories like this. We, as an industry and as a society at large, need to play our part. There has to be zero tolerance of any such behaviour in any walk of life. We owe that to these women's bravery in coming forward."" Leonardo DiCaprio, Actor ""There is no excuse for sexual harassment or sexual assault - no matter who you are and no matter what profession. I applaud the strength and courage of the women who came forward and made their voices heard."" Michelle and Barack Obama, Former US First Lady/President ""Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status."" Emmy Rossum, Actress ""The 'old dinosaur' explanation doesn't cut it. Decades of using power to intimidate women for sexual gain is reprehensible and inexcusable."" Judd Apatow, Director ""What Harvey Weinstein did was abhorrent. He admits he did it. Why should anyone be silent in their disgust and support for his victims?"" Patricia Arquette, Actress ""If there is a way to cure yourself of being a predator than I hope Harvey learns what it is & shares it with the world. It's an epidemic."" Michael Keaton, Actor ""H Weinstein - yikes! Disgusting and creepy. So is 'leader of the free world', by the way."" Kevin Smith, Director ""He financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed."" Jessica Chastain, Actress ""I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an environment for it to happen again."" Mark Ruffalo, Actor ""To be clear what Harvey Weinstein did was a disgusting abuse of power and horrible. I hope we are now seeing the beginning of the end of these abuses."" Lena Dunham, Actress ""Easy to think Weinstein company took swift action but this has actually been the slowest action because they always always knew."" Julianne Moore, Actress ""Coming forward about sexual abuse and coercion is scary and women have nothing to be gained personally by doing so. But through their bravery we move forward as a culture, and I thank them. Stand with Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and others."" Judy Dench, Actress ""Whilst there is no doubt that Harvey Weinstein has helped and championed my film career for the past 20 years, I was completely unaware of these offences which are, of course, horrifying, and I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out."" Glenn Close, Actress ""I'm sitting here, deeply upset, acknowledging to myself that, yes, for many years, I have been aware of the vague rumours that Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of behaving inappropriately around women. Harvey has always been decent to me, but now that the rumours are being substantiated, I feel angry and darkly sad. I'm angry, not just at him and the conspiracy of silence around his actions, but also that the ""casting couch"" phenomenon, so to speak, is still a reality in our business and in the world: the horrible pressure, the awful expectation put on a woman when a powerful, egotistical, entitled bully expects sexual favors in exchange for a job. Ours is an industry in which very few actors are indispensable and women are cast in far fewer roles than men, so the stakes are higher for women and make them more vulnerable to the manipulations of a predator. I applaud the monumental courage of the women who have spoken up. I hope that their stories and the reportage that gave them their voices represents a tipping point, that more stories will be told and that change will follow. The changes must be both institutional and personal. Men and women, in positions of power, must create a work environment in which people, whose jobs depend on them, feel safe to report threatening and inappropriate behaviour, like that reported in the Times. No one should be coerced into trading personal dignity for professional success. I feel the time is long and tragically overdue for all of us in the industry, women and men, to unite - calmly and dispassionately - and create a new culture of respect, equality and empowerment, where bullies and their enablers are no longer allowed to prosper."" Meryl Streep, Actress ""The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes. One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn't know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And if everybody knew, I don't believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it. The behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game."" Kate Winslet, Actress ""His behaviour is without question disgraceful and appalling and very, very wrong. I had hoped that these kind of stories were just made up rumours, maybe we have all been naive."" Jennifer Lawrence, Actress ""I was deeply disturbed to hear the news about Harvey Weinstein's behaviour. This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting."" George Clooney, Actor ""I suppose the argument would be that it's not just about Hollywood, but about all of us - that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don't speak up, you're complicit."" Ben Affleck, Actor ""I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades."" Matt Damon, Actor ""As the father of four daughters, this is the kind of sexual predation that keeps me up at night. This is the great fear for all of us. I did five or six movies with Harvey. I never saw this. I feel horrible for these women and it's wonderful they have this incredible courage and are standing up now. We can all feel this change that's happening, which is necessary and overdue."" Nicole Kidman, Actress ""As I've stated before publicly, I support and applaud all women and these women who speak out against any abuse and misuse of power - be it domestic violence or sexual harassment in the workforce. We need to eradicate this behaviour."" Colin Firth, who won an Oscar in the Weinstein-produced The King's Speech, also weighed in on the scandal, saying actress Sophie Dix told him 25 years ago about an alleged incident involving Weinstein. Firth told the Guardian: ""I remember her being profoundly upset by it. To my shame, I merely expressed sympathy."" ""I didn't act on what she told me,"" he added, saying the ""conversation has come back to haunt me in the light of these revelations"". ""It's the only direct account of this kind of behaviour by Harvey Weinstein that's ever been told to me,"" he added. ""What I heard, it turns out, was part of a horrifying pattern."" :: Goldman Sachs mulls its £750k stake in The Weinstein Company He said: ""Other women have been hurt since. And those of us who didn't act on our one bit of knowledge - and especially those of us who went on to work with Weinstein - have that on our conscience."" Dix, who starred opposite Firth in the 1993 film Hour Of The Pig, went public with her allegations this week. Oliver Stone, Director ""I'm a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial. I believe a man shouldn't be condemned by a vigilante system. It's not easy what he's going through, either."" He later said: ""After looking at what has been reported in many publications over the last couple of days, I'm appalled and commend the courage of the women who've stepped forward to report sexual abuse or rape."" Lindsay Lohan, Actress ""I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now, I don't think it's right what's going on. I think Georgina [Chapman] needs to take a stand and be there for her husband. He's never harmed me or did anything to me - we've done several movies together. I think everyone needs to stop - I think it's wrong. So stand up."" Donna Karan, Fashion Designer ""I think we have to look at ourselves. Obviously, the treatment of women all over the world is something that has always had to be identified. Certainly in the country of Haiti where I work, in Africa, in the developing world, it's been a hard time for women. To see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality? And what are we throwing out to our children today about how to dance and how to perform and what to wear? How much should they show? Yes, I think he's being looked at right now as a symbol, not necessarily as him. I know his wife, I think they're wonderful people, Harvey has done some amazing things. I think we have to look at our world and what we want to say and how we want to say it as well. You look at everything all over the world today and how women are dressing and what they are asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble."" The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is to hold an emergency meeting today to discuss throwing Weinstein out. The meeting will involve the Academy's 54-member board of governors. The Producers' Guild of America is also meeting to discuss the scandal and consider possible disciplinary proceedings and Weinstein's membership, a report says."

A truck bomb exploded on Saturday outside a hotel at a busy intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and stalls, destroying buildings and setting cars on fire, police said. Two hours later, a second blast struck the city's Medina district. Doctors are struggling to assist hundreds of wounded victims, with many burnt beyond recognition, according to reports. ""The hospital is overwhelmed by both dead and wounded,"" said Dr. Mohamed Yusuf, director of Medina hospital. ""We also received people whose limbs were cut away by the bomb. This is really horrendous, unlike any other time in the past."" A mother of four, Zainab Sharif, lost her husband. ""There's nothing I can say. We have lost everything,"" she said. President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo has called for donations of blood as he declared three days of national mourning.

The International Committee of the Red Cross says four volunteers with the Somali Red Crescent Society are also among the dead. ""This figure may rise as there are a number of volunteers still missing,"" it said in a statement. The United States has condemned the attack. A statement by the US mission to Somalia says that ""such cowardly attacks reinvigorate the commitment of the United States to assist our Somali and African Union partners to combat the scourge of terrorism"". Somalia's government has blamed the attack on the al Shabaab extremist group, which has not commented. Mogadishu is often a target for extremist group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda. The group is waging an insurgency against the UN-backed government and its African Union allies. Its aim is to topple the administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is a peace operation that aims to ""reduce the threat of Al Shabaab and other armed opposition groups""."
2017-10-15,"Drivers who kill while at the wheel face the risk of a life behind bars, the Government has confirmed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171016065416/http://news.sky.com/story/killer-drivers-face-risk-of-life-behind-bars-11082093,"Motorists who cause death by speeding, street racing or while on a mobile phone are among those who may be handed a life sentence. Thousands of people backed the calls for a change in the law when the Government carried out a consultation last year. Ministers say they will now act on those calls, with a maximum life sentence for those convicted of causing death by dangerous driving or causing death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs. They will also introduce a new offence of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, punishable by imprisonment, to plug a gap in the statute book. Justice Minister Dominic Raab told Sky News: ""We've taken a long hard look at this subject. ""Based on the worst cases, the most serious offending, on the anguish of the victims' families... we think the time is now right to introduce a maximum life sentence for those who kill people on the roads by driving dangerously, drunk or on drugs. ""We also think it's right to introduce a new criminal offence, attracting a prison sentence, of causing serious injury by careless driving, again, affecting the worst life-changing injuries and the most serious cases."" Lorraine Allaway, whose husband Bob was killed two years ago by a drunk driver who was given a four and a half year sentence, said: ""A life sentence is what should be given to drivers that kill. ""I can't go on holidays or celebrate Christmas, or celebrate anniversaries or birthdays any more. He's going to go home at the end of his term and he's going to be able to be with his family and go on holidays and all this sort of thing and I just feel that is totally unfair."" Imogen Cauthery, who was put into a coma by a driver using his mobile phone and still suffers epilepsy and memory problems, described the change in sentencing guidelines as ""brilliant"". ""It's fantastic. About time too,"" she told Sky News. ""So many people are injured on the roads because of careless drivers every year. Deaths. I suffer survivors' guilt. Why am I still alive and other people aren't. If you are going to drive, you have to pay attention. ""It happened so long ago but it's part of my life now. It's left me with all these problems. It ruined my life. Epilepsy is my worst enemy. It almost killed me a few years ago."" Asked what she would say to otherwise normal people who may occasionally use a mobile phone while driving, she said: ""Don't use it and don't speed and don't drink and be grateful you can drive."" Around 90% of people who responded to the Government's consultation backed the creation of the new offence, and 70% thought the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving should be increased from 14 years to life imprisonment. The Ministry of Justice said the ""vast majority"" also felt the punishment for causing death by careless driving whilst under the influence of drink and drugs should also be life in jail. MoJ figures show 157 people were sentenced for causing death by dangerous driving and 32 were convicted of causing death by careless driving while under the influence in 2016. Some legal experts have said that if the Government is going to introduce the new penalties, more needs to be done to educate drivers about the consequences."

According to the plane's first officer, the ""startle factor of the drone's proximity"" almost caused him to switch off the autopilot system and take ""avoiding action"". The UK Airprox Board (UKAB) said: ""A larger aircraft might not have missed it, and in the captain's opinion it had put 130 lives at risk."" The air safety experts have not identified the airline involved nor where the aircraft was coming from. The plane landed safely. Steve Landells, former RAF and British Airways pilot, said the incident was ""another worrying near miss that could have ended in tragedy"". It was one of 18 other incidents involving drones and other objects investigated at the most recent UKAB meeting. In July, research found that drones can smash plane windscreens, prompting the Department for Transport to announce plans for a drone registration system. Mr Landells, who is also a flight safety specialist at Balpa, the pilot's association, said: ""We can't allow the programme of action to slip. ""Balpa is keen to see details of what this potential new legislation will look like and set a timescale for its implementation.

In 2015, Nigel Farage proposed stopping all low and un-skilled workers coming into the country and a cap of 50,000 on high-skilled immigrants. Mr Bolton said the net figure should be zero to ease pressure on services and infrastructure. He told the Sunday with Paterson show: ""We are as a country being swamped by the fact we're having a net immigration that is approximately the size of Wolverhampton or Hull ever year. ""That's difficult to cope with in terms of our services and infrastructure when we're cutting police by 25%, for example, local government in some cases by 50%."" He initially rejected to say how many people should be let into the country each year, describing it as ""arbitrary"". But Mr Bolton conceded: ""In an ideal world, and I'm not saying this is practical, we should be aiming - certainly for the next few years - to zero net immigration. ""But the chances of hitting zero net immigration - it's a very difficult target to hit, for no other reason than the fact net immigration is also affected by the number of people who leave the country, and we can't control how many people leave the country. Mr Bolton, who became UKIP's fourth leader in 12 months at a conference in Torquay last month, added he would not promise things the party knew it could not achieve. The former Liberal Democrat and army officer also said burqas should be included on a list of banned face coverings in public places that also included motorcycle helmets. And he said his work as a diplomat in the Middle East had made him ""learnt a lot about"" Islam. ""It's been an education,"" he said. Mr Bolton also blasted the Government over its Brexit handling, saying it had been ""negligent in the extreme"" for conducting ""no planning and preparation"" for a 'no deal' divorce."

The young man was left in a critical condition and several others were injured. But on Sunday night, West Midlands Police confirmed the 19-year-old had since died and a murder investigation had been launched. Several hundred people had turned up to the boxing event to see the main contest, the IBF Youth Lightweight title bout between local prospect Luke Paddock and Derby's Myron Mills. But, according to witnesses, a fight had started inside the venue during a bout. A number of people were thrown out of the building by security staff and the fight then continued outside at around midnight. Detective Inspector Ian Wilkins said: ""The event was attended by several hundred people and we are trawling CCTV to identify those involved. ""We are in the early stages of our inquiry and I would urge anyone who witnessed what happened and has not yet spoken to us to come forward."" Meanwhile, event promoter Black Country Boxing (BCB) said: ""Our thoughts are with the victims and we will be liaising fully with the police and the venue.""

Mrs Leadsom told The Sunday Times: ""Some people might think this is a trivial matter - but over the course of the repairs, we have a duty to uphold the huge appeal of Big Ben to the millions of tourists that visit it each year.

The current Elizabeth Tower renovation was originally estimated at £29m last year but it is now expected to cost around £61m.

Sky News estimates more than 40 women have come forward with accusations of rape, sexual assault and harassment against Weinstein, although the disgraced filmmaker denies wrongdoing. Speaking at an AmfAR charity gala, Corden told his audience: ""It's a beautiful night here in LA. ""So beautiful, Harvey Weinstein has already asked tonight up to his hotel to give him a massage"". Among his other jokes were: ""It has been weird this week though, watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water. ""Ask any of the women who watched him take a bath."" To be clear, sexual assault is no laughing matter. I was not trying to make light of Harvey’s inexcusable behavior, (1/2) but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims. I am truly sorry for anyone offended, that was never my intention. (2/2) Corden apologised on Twitter, writing: ""To be clear, sexual assault is no laughing matter.

2017-10-15,Austria's foreign minister is on course to become the country's next chancellor and the world's youngest head of government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171016065416/http://news.sky.com/story/austria-on-course-to-elect-worlds-youngest-leader-11082955,"Sebastian Kurz, 31, has declared victory after near-final results from Sunday's election put his People's Party on 31.4%. That figure is not enough for an overall majority, meaning he would either have to form a coalition or a minority government to become chancellor. The eurosceptic Freedom Party is in second place with 27.4% and the centre-left Social Democrats are third with 26.7%. Both Mr Kurz's People's Party and the Freedom Party have focused their campaigns on concerns about immigration and Islam. If projections are correct, it could herald a coalition between the two parties - which would mean a rightward turn for Austria. However, following his declaration of victory Mr Kurz stated he may be prepared to form a minority government. ""I would of course like to form a stable government,"" he told broadcaster ORF. ""If that cannot be done then there are other options."" Mr Kurz said he planned to talk to all parties in parliament but would first wait for a count of postal ballots that begins today. The country is currently governed by a coalition made up of the left-wing Social Democrats and the People's Party, with Mr Kurz acting as foreign minister. Mr Kurz has been credited with moving his centre-right party further to the right - particularly on the issues of migration and Muslims. He has avoided the stronger rhetoric of Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party, but Mr Kurz is still expected to capitalise on Austrian voters' concerns about immigration. He has promised voters ""real change"" if he is elected chancellor. At 31, he would beat the leader of San Marino, Enrico Carattoni, and North Korea's Kim Jong Un to become the world's youngest leader. Mr Carattoni is 32, while the Mr Kim is 33."
2017-10-15,"When compared with political nicknames such as Iron Lady, Tarzan or Grand Old Man, the sobriquet of Spreadsheet Phil doesn't shine.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171016065416/http://news.sky.com/story/is-chancellor-philip-hammond-heading-for-the-sack-11082684,"But it does at least ring true about the incumbent Chancellor, Philip Hammond: patrician, restrained, even dour. He makes an unlikely lightning rod for fury. Yet this week barely a day has passed without Hammond attracting the ire of his colleagues. He has become the de facto ringmaster of the Tory Remainers. He is privately and publicly scornful of his Brexiteer colleagues. He considers them to be out of touch with economic and commercial reality. He has become the go-to voice for the City and big business in the Cabinet, who argue for as little change as possible. Hence this week his reluctance to commit to spend Treasury money on tasking the civil service to prepare for a no-deal scenario with Brussels. He said it would be wrong to do so ""just to make some demonstration point"". This enraged the Brexiteers. They suspect foul play, that he's trying to frustrate Brexit. Consequently one of Hammond's predecessors, Nigel Lawson, told me on Thursday that he was ""damaging the country"" and that Theresa May should sack him. Many MPs agreed. And today, The Sunday Telegraph's front page told us that the DUP are similarly incensed. The paper says senior DUP parliamentary sources have said they are ""extremely concerned about Philip Hammond's behaviour"" and that he is ""trying to frustrate the Brexit process"". The article claims the DUP source has said Theresa May must sack him if he doesn't change his tune. Given Mrs May is Prime Minister only because of their 10 seats, this is no insignificant threat. But is it true? I have my doubts. For a start, although the DUP are arch-Brexiteers, they are most certainly not ""no-dealers"". They know more than anyone how damaging a hard border would be for Northern Ireland. That is what would return if Britain cannot reach an accommodation with the EU. Indeed, the DUP told Sky's David Blevins on Sunday morning that they do not recognise the comments attributed to them by the Telegraph. There is mischief afoot. And I wonder whether some of the more extreme stories being pumped into the press this week about Hammond might not have the fingerprints of team Boris Johnson. Let's not forget, only a week ago it was his future, not the Chancellor's, which was on everyone's lips. And maybe that's not surprising, for they have each, in their own way, come to epitomise one wing of their party: the hard Remainers and hard Leavers respectively. Consequently, each side is calling for the other's captain to get the sack. Precisely for this reason, I suspect in the end, May will choose not to move either. Reshuffling either a chancellor or foreign secretary is a big step even for a powerful PM. For a weak one, in a situation where both would probably choose to return to the backbenches rather than be moved, it could be lethal. Especially given the wider Brexit politics. :: UKIP leader - I could strangle a badger:: 'Brexit makes hard Irish border inevitable' Moving one but not the other would disrupt the extremely delicate equilibrium between the factions in the Tory Europe civil war. And moving both? Maybe even worse - it might actually be the one thing to bring them together. Much better to leave them and create space for new blood lower down the cabinet pecking order. After all, in some ways, who is the person who suffers most from a wounded chancellor and foreign secretary? A wounded prime minister, worried for her job."

The minister played down fears of a ""no deal"" Brexit by saying the UK could fall back on ""Operation Stack"" - the police initiative that sees trucks ""park"" on the M20, essentially creating 3,000 ""spaces"". It is used if the port - which only has 550 parking spaces for HGVs - is disrupted by weather, strikes or power failures. Mr Grayling was pressed over what would happen to trucks travelling into Europe if Brexit negotiators failed to reach a deal. ""We already have provision in place for Operation Stack around the border at the moment,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""We have the whole of Manston Airfield available to use if Operation Stack is needed when the Channel ports don't function. ""We're now doing detailed work to look at how we take those arrangements forward in 2019 if we need them. ""We have got contingency plans in place for delays around the lorry ports right now but what we're working on is making sure we've got developed plans for 2019. He insisted: ""We will have those in place."" Mr Grayling also said a ""no deal"" Brexit would mean UK residents would buy more home-grown food, and farmers would increase produce. And he said no-one had expected the negotiations with Brussels to be done in ""half an hour"", dismissing shadow chancellor John McDonnell's suggestion that there was enough support among MPs to block a ""no deal"" scenario. Labour's Barry Gardiner later attacked the Government for getting the Brexit talks wrong ""right at the start"" because it ""failed to set the right tone"". He told Sky News the ""incapacity"" of a Cabinet divided by soft and hard Brexiteers was now being revealed. :: Nuclear industry prepares for 'no deal' Brexit:: Clinton warns Brexiteers on Trump trade ""No deal"" dominated the headlines after questions over Chancellor Philip Hammond's planning for the scenario in next month's Budget. Mr Hammond, who apologised for branding Brussels negotiators ""the enemy"", insisted at a select committee appearance: ""We do have planning for all scenarios, including a no-deal scenario."""

The appointment of ‎a top professional services firm will raise concerns that Interserve, which has contracts include managing the Salisbury Plain military training base for the Ministry of Defence, could be facing a financial restructuring similar to that of rival Carillion. Interserve, which saw its shares halve last month when it blamed economic uncertainty and weak Government spending for a downgraded profit forecast, has seen its chief executive and finance director resign in the last year. It also warned that costs associated with exiting its energy-from-waste business would be much higher than the previous estimate of £160m. The company's other contracts include a construction project at Durham University and support for the UK armed forces in Cyprus, Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. It also worked on the renovation of Albert Bridge in London. :: What's behind Interserve's gloomy outlook? Sources said that Interserve's lenders were becoming increasingly anxious about its balance sheet despite its declaration last month that it ""continues to believe that the group will be able to operate within its banking covenants for the year ended 31 December 2017"". ‎The company now has a market value of little more than £150m, with some bankers suggesting it may be a candidate for a private equity-backed takeover. Interserve's woes are the latest in an outsourcing sector hit by a decline in government spending and growing cost pressures. Carillion, Mitie and Serco‎ have all been forced to change their leadership in an effort to transform their fortunes. An Interserve spokesman failed to return several calls seeking comment."

So, here's what you need to know about Hurricane Ophelia: :: How powerful is it? Hurricane Ophelia has reached category two status but, by the time it reaches the UK and Ireland, it will weaken and no longer be classified as a hurricane. However, the storm will still produce very strong winds of up to 80mph. :: When is it due to arrive and which areas are likely to be most affected? It will arrive on Monday. A red warning (meaning ""take action"" to protect yourself) is issued for southern Ireland, and a yellow warning (meaning ""be aware"" the weather conditions might affect you) is issued for Scotland and western parts of the UK. England and Wales will be quite windy but won't feel the full impact of the storm. :: Is there a threat to life? Winds as strong as 80mph are capable of causing structural damage, downing power lines and uprooting trees, so it is important to be aware and travel only if necessary. It is best to follow official guidance when the storm arrives and the risks become clearer. :: Will it cause a lot of disruption? It is possible the storm will have an impact on Monday morning's rush hour. The Met Office says road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected. :: Should we be worried? Don't be worried - but it is important to be aware, read the official guidance and check weather broadcasts when the storm arrives."

Before the 1964 Games, the flame, lit in Olympia, Greece, wound its way through 10 countries before landing in Okinawa. It was then divided and sent to the cities of Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Chitose. The flame in Kagoshima was kept in a a sports training facility where it remained without incident for many years. But the flame found its way back into the spotlight in September 2013, when Japan's capital was awarded the right to host the 2020 Games. An official, who - perhaps understandably - asked to remain anonymous, has admitted to AFP news agency that the flame actually went out a few months later, in November 2013. ""At that time, I could not say something that could destroy (people's) dreams,"" said the man, who had been in charge of the facility at the time. ""I saw with my own eyes that the flame went out on 21 November. ""We re-lit the fire and kept it going for about two weeks but I thought that was not good."" This was only a few months after Japan had won the right to host the 2020 Games, and the flame's fame was at its peak. He said: ""We kept receiving a number of requests from various people to use the sacred flame for town festivals and weddings. ""I decided to come clean."" Mitsuru Horinouchi, an official in Kagoshima, also confirmed to AFP that the flame went out for good in November 2013. There is now a different flame in its place, lit by a magnifying glass and sunlight in December 2013 and kept in a camp site. Nearby is a panel that explains the sad fate of its predecessor."

The carmaker plans to move towards a ""single shift operation"" during 2018, saying a plan had been put in place for a ""voluntary separation programme"" amounting to around 400 heads by the end of 2017. Demand for five-door family cars like the Astra is falling, while the market for SUVs is growing. Even so, it has been the sixth most popular new car for motorists this year. More than 34,000 were registered between January and July. The Ellesmere production plant produced its four millionth Astra in September. The European Commission approved a £1.9bn deal in July for French car giant PSA Group to buy Opel, which owns Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen. The company also agreed to buy the loss-making European arm of General Motors in March. The takeover raised concerns in the UK about the impact on jobs at Vauxhall plants and supply companies."

2017-10-15,There's been an unpleasant crumpling of paper and packaging shares following a profits warning from Mondi.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171016065416/http://news.sky.com/story/mondi-profit-warning-sees-shares-in-paper-and-packaging-firm-crumple-11076462,"You may not have heard of this company but, courtesy of its membership of the FTSE 100, the chances are that you will indirectly own shares in it via tracker funds held by your life policy, pension fund or ISA. For Mondi is a business with a stock market value - even after the latest profit alert - of £10bn. And while its origins are in South Africa and its corporate headquarters are in Vienna, it operates out of no fewer than 40 locations in the UK, including manufacturing sites at Deeside, North Wales, Nelson in Lancashire and Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. It used to be bigger still in Britain, having until 2012 owned the newsprint supplier Aylesford, whose paper was used by titles including The Times, the Daily Mirror and The Observer. Previously part of Anglo American, the international mining giant, it was spun off as a separate business as its own right in 2007 and has spent most of the intervening period in the FTSE 100. It has not been a bad investment, either, with the shares delivering a 322% return during that period compared with one of just 20% from the FTSE All Share index. This has been bolstered by rapid growth in recent years following acquisitions in a number of countries and, in particular, emerging markets in Asia and central and Eastern Europe. During the last four years alone, Mondi has spent €1.6bn (£1.4bn) on acquisitions, with more deals promised. These, in theory, should be boom times for Mondi. Paper and packaging sounds relatively unglamorous as a business activity yet, as globalisation swells the ranks of the middle classes in markets like India and Turkey, more people are buying more things - and that means more paper and packaging. The rise of e-commerce in developed markets, meanwhile, has also created a demand for packaging. Accordingly, the company has grown full year operating profits from €547m in 2012 to €943m last year, with sales also rising solidly in that time. So what appears to have gone wrong now? Well, a couple of things. Firstly, the company has been caught out by currency issues, chiefly the US dollar - the weakest-performing major currency this year - and a fall in the Turkish lira. At the same time, input costs have also bitten, with Mondi citing higher wood, energy and chemical costs than in the same period last year. The price of recycled paper, which is being demanded by increasing numbers of customers for environmental reasons, was up 15% during the third quarter of the year from the corresponding period a year ago. There have also been closures, for maintenance, of some of the company's paper mills. The company added: ""Continuing cost pressures and negative currency impacts are expected to result in an underlying performance for the year modestly below market expectations."" That has been enough to send shares of Mondi down by nearly 8% and also drag down shares of other packaging firms, including Smurfit Kappa, the Irish packaging giant which is also in the FTSE 100 and DS Smith, the British group that sits just outside the index. Should investors panic? Probably not. Yes, sentiment in companies like this is always going to be influenced by short-term currency fluctuations and short-term price movements that - as has been seen - can blow profitability off-course for one or two quarters. Yet this is a company that, for many years, has enjoyed industry-beating returns and which is operating in an industry in which big is beautiful and which is consolidating. It is also operating in a sector where, as DS Smith has shown, innovation is prized by customers. Mondi recently bought Excelsior, a British business that has a reputation for coming up with bright ideas in food packaging, an area in which Mondi has previously not had much of a presence - but in which, with its strong global distribution, it could easily roll out innovative products and gain market share quickly. Those investors of a short-term persuasion may well have thrown their share certificates in the waste-paper basket. Others taking a longer-term view will keep them on their desk under the paper-weight."

I met him for a business meeting in Paris at which he behaved inappropriately and I had to push him off. I got away without it going further, but the experience left me shocked and disgusted. I have not discussed this before because I wanted to maintain my privacy, but I understand it is important to do so as I hear about other women's experiences. Women are often condemned when they speak out and their personal reputations tarnished by association. I salute the great bravery of the women who have come forward. We should recognise that this sort of behaviour exists everywhere and is not unique to the entertainment industry. The exploitation of power is ubiquitous. This behaviour is unacceptable and needs to be eliminated."" Claire Forlani, Actress ""You see, nothing happened to me with Harvey - by that I mean, I escaped 5 times. I had two Peninsula Hotel meetings in the evening with Harvey and all I remember was I ducked, dived and ultimately got out of there without getting slobbered over, well just a bit. Yes, massage was suggested. The three dinners with Harvey I don't really remember the time period, I was 25. I remember him telling me all the actresses who had slept with him and what he had done for them.""

""He then invited me to his room. I quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside. She said it wasn't and wouldn't be for a bit and I should go to his room. ""At that moment I felt very powerless and scared but didn't want to act that way hoping that I was wrong about the situation. ""When I arrived I was relieved to find another woman in his room and thought immediately I was safe. ""He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction. I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing....i thought it would make the situation better....more professional....like an audition....i was so nervous.

Sky News estimates more than 40 women have come forward with accusations. Woody Allen, Director ""No one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness. And they wouldn't, because you are not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie. But you do hear a million fanciful rumours all the time. And some turn out to be true and some - many - are just stories about this actress, or that actor. The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved. Tragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that is life is so messed up. There's no winners in that, it's just very, very sad and tragic for those poor women that had to go through that."" Tom Hanks, Actor ""Look, I don't want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can't buy, 'Oh, well, I grew up in the '60s and '70s and so therefore' - I did, too. So I think it's like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can."" Ryan Gosling, Actor ""I want to add my voice of support for the women who have had the courage to speak out against Harvey Weinstein. Like most people in Hollywood, I have worked with him and I'm deeply disappointed in myself for being so oblivious to these devastating experiences of sexual harassment and abuse. He is emblematic of a systemic problem. Men should stand with women and work together until there is real accountability and change."" Emma Thompson, Actress ""I don't think you can describe him as a sex addict. He's a predator - that's different. He's at the top of, as it were, the ladder of, a system of harassment and belittlement and bullying and interference. This has been part of our world, women's world, since time immemorial."" Bob Weinstein, Harvey's brother and the co-founder of The Weinstein Company ""My brother has caused unconscionable suffering. As a father of three girls I say this with every bone in my body - I am heartbroken for the women that he has harmed,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. ""I'm ashamed that he is my brother, to be honest, and I am ashamed that these are his actions."" He added: ""I'm mortified and disgusted by my brother's actions. And I am sick for the victims."" ""It's unbelievable that even to this moment he is more concerned with who sold him out. I don't hear concern or contrition for the victims."" Colin Farrell, Actor ""I'm just watching it unfold and then tearing myself away from it and realising the horribleness of it all and the wrongdoing, fundamentally, around the whole thing and just wish healing for everyone and that changes are made. I hope anyone who was hurt that they have healing. It's just atrocious, really."" Carey Mulligan, Actress ""Thank God it's all coming out, it's horrific. And thank God it's coming to the fore and these incredible women are feeling brave enough to be able to come forward and say something about it."" Colin Firth, Actor ""She told me she had had a distressing encounter with Harvey Weinstein,"" Firth told the Guardian about one of the accusers, Sophie Dix. ""I don't think she went into all the horrific detail I've read in her interview. But I remember her being profoundly upset by it. To my shame, I merely expressed sympathy. I didn't act on what she told me. It was a long time ago and I don't know if she remembers telling me, but the fact that I had that conversation has come back to haunt me in the light of these revelations. It's the only direct account of this kind of behaviour by Harvey Weinstein that's ever been told to me."" Kelly MacDonald, Actress ""He needs to be locked up - that's the main thing. He seems to have behaved in a way that you would think that's the very least that should happen."" Paris Hilton, Socialite ""Growing up in Hollywood I've experienced that a lot. I think when someone is in power then they are able to do that - so I think it's really brave of these women to be speaking out and to start a movement to stop this. Because it happens way too often."" Anette Bening, Actress ""Perhaps now that this has been uncovered, things will change. Maybe men will understand things better and young women as well. It is very, very important that they spoke out."" James Van Der Beek, Actor ""For anyone judging the women who stayed silent, read this for perspective. Also for anyone brushing off harassment as 'boys being boys'. What Weinstein is being accused of is criminal. What he's admitted to is unacceptable - in any industry. I applaud everybody speaking out. I've had my ass grabbed by older, powerful men, I've had them corner me ininappropriate sexual conversations when I was much younger... I understand the unwarranted shame, powerlessness & inability to blow the whistle. There's a power dynamic that feels impossible to overcome."" Ewan McGregor, Actor ""It's about time this came to light and he is getting just deserts. Heard rumours over the years but this is awful. Bye Bully!"" Brie Larson, Actress ""As always, I stand with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment. It's not your fault. I believe you."" Jeff Bridges, Actor ""Talk about facing your fear, he's gotta face his demons now. I wish him the best of luck with that, he needs to lean in and really face those things."" Benedict Cumberbatch, Actor ""I am utterly disgusted by the continuing revelations of Harvey Weinstein's horrifying and unforgivable actions. We need to collectively stand up and support victims of abuse such as the brave and inspiring women who have spoken out against him and say we hear you and believe you. That way others may be emboldened by our support to come forward and speak. But we shouldn't wait until there are any more stories like this. We, as an industry and as a society at large, need to play our part. There has to be zero tolerance of any such behaviour in any walk of life. We owe that to these women's bravery in coming forward."" Leonardo DiCaprio, Actor ""There is no excuse for sexual harassment or sexual assault - no matter who you are and no matter what profession. I applaud the strength and courage of the women who came forward and made their voices heard."" Michelle and Barack Obama, Former US First Lady/President ""Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status."" Emmy Rossum, Actress ""The 'old dinosaur' explanation doesn't cut it. Decades of using power to intimidate women for sexual gain is reprehensible and inexcusable."" Judd Apatow, Director ""What Harvey Weinstein did was abhorrent. He admits he did it. Why should anyone be silent in their disgust and support for his victims?"" Patricia Arquette, Actress ""If there is a way to cure yourself of being a predator than I hope Harvey learns what it is & shares it with the world. It's an epidemic."" Michael Keaton, Actor ""H Weinstein - yikes! Disgusting and creepy. So is 'leader of the free world', by the way."" Kevin Smith, Director ""He financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed."" Jessica Chastain, Actress ""I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an environment for it to happen again."" Mark Ruffalo, Actor ""To be clear what Harvey Weinstein did was a disgusting abuse of power and horrible. I hope we are now seeing the beginning of the end of these abuses."" Lena Dunham, Actress ""Easy to think Weinstein company took swift action but this has actually been the slowest action because they always always knew."" Julianne Moore, Actress ""Coming forward about sexual abuse and coercion is scary and women have nothing to be gained personally by doing so. But through their bravery we move forward as a culture, and I thank them. Stand with Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and others."" Judy Dench, Actress ""Whilst there is no doubt that Harvey Weinstein has helped and championed my film career for the past 20 years, I was completely unaware of these offences which are, of course, horrifying, and I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out."" Glenn Close, Actress ""I'm sitting here, deeply upset, acknowledging to myself that, yes, for many years, I have been aware of the vague rumours that Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of behaving inappropriately around women. Harvey has always been decent to me, but now that the rumours are being substantiated, I feel angry and darkly sad. I'm angry, not just at him and the conspiracy of silence around his actions, but also that the ""casting couch"" phenomenon, so to speak, is still a reality in our business and in the world: the horrible pressure, the awful expectation put on a woman when a powerful, egotistical, entitled bully expects sexual favors in exchange for a job. Ours is an industry in which very few actors are indispensable and women are cast in far fewer roles than men, so the stakes are higher for women and make them more vulnerable to the manipulations of a predator. I applaud the monumental courage of the women who have spoken up. I hope that their stories and the reportage that gave them their voices represents a tipping point, that more stories will be told and that change will follow. The changes must be both institutional and personal. Men and women, in positions of power, must create a work environment in which people, whose jobs depend on them, feel safe to report threatening and inappropriate behaviour, like that reported in the Times. No one should be coerced into trading personal dignity for professional success. I feel the time is long and tragically overdue for all of us in the industry, women and men, to unite - calmly and dispassionately - and create a new culture of respect, equality and empowerment, where bullies and their enablers are no longer allowed to prosper."" Meryl Streep, Actress ""The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes. One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn't know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And if everybody knew, I don't believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it. The behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game."" Kate Winslet, Actress ""His behaviour is without question disgraceful and appalling and very, very wrong. I had hoped that these kind of stories were just made up rumours, maybe we have all been naive."" Jennifer Lawrence, Actress ""I was deeply disturbed to hear the news about Harvey Weinstein's behaviour. This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting."" George Clooney, Actor ""I suppose the argument would be that it's not just about Hollywood, but about all of us - that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don't speak up, you're complicit."" Ben Affleck, Actor ""I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades."" Matt Damon, Actor ""As the father of four daughters, this is the kind of sexual predation that keeps me up at night. This is the great fear for all of us. I did five or six movies with Harvey. I never saw this. I feel horrible for these women and it's wonderful they have this incredible courage and are standing up now. We can all feel this change that's happening, which is necessary and overdue."" Nicole Kidman, Actress ""As I've stated before publicly, I support and applaud all women and these women who speak out against any abuse and misuse of power - be it domestic violence or sexual harassment in the workforce. We need to eradicate this behaviour."" Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" all allegations, but police forces in the both the UK and US have said investigations are under way. The producer was kicked out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Saturday, a move that follows him being expelled from the company he co-founded with his brother after selling Miramax - The Weinstein Company. :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's infamous casting couch He has also been left by his wife and is believed to have checked into rehab. A number of Hollywood stars and politicians have issued statements expressing their ""shock"" and ""disgust"", while others like director Oliver Stone, actress Lindsay Lohan and fashion designer Donna Karan have showed sympathy with the producer. Oliver Stone, Director ""I'm a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial. I believe a man shouldn't be condemned by a vigilante system. It's not easy what he's going through, either."" He later said: ""After looking at what has been reported in many publications over the last couple of days, I'm appalled and commend the courage of the women who've stepped forward to report sexual abuse or rape."" Lindsay Lohan, Actress ""I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now, I don't think it's right what's going on. I think Georgina [Chapman] needs to take a stand and be there for her husband. He's never harmed me or did anything to me - we've done several movies together. I think everyone needs to stop - I think it's wrong. So stand up."" Donna Karan, Fashion Designer ""I think we have to look at ourselves. Obviously, the treatment of women all over the world is something that has always had to be identified. Certainly in the country of Haiti where I work, in Africa, in the developing world, it's been a hard time for women. To see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality? And what are we throwing out to our children today about how to dance and how to perform and what to wear? How much should they show? Yes, I think he's being looked at right now as a symbol, not necessarily as him. I know his wife, I think they're wonderful people, Harvey has done some amazing things. I think we have to look at our world and what we want to say and how we want to say it as well. You look at everything all over the world today and how women are dressing and what they are asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble."" Quentin Tarantino, one of Weinstein's oldest friends and collaborators, has issued a statement saying he was ""stunned"" and ""heartbroken"" but he needed more time to ""process pain, emotions, anger and memory"" before speaking publicly. Weinstein has also been temporarily banned from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) and the Producers' Guild Of America have announced they will hold a meeting to decide on his membership. On Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced he was ""taking steps"" to strip Weinstein of his Legion d'Honneur - the country's highest decoration. Companies have also been affected in the scandal, with Goldman Sachs saying it is ""exploring options"" for its £750,000 stake in The Weinstein Company and Amazon placing its studios boss Roy Price on a leave of absence following claims he knew of Weinstein's behaviour. Sky News has reached Weinstein's representatives for comment but they have yet to respond."

Government sources say the meeting has been planned for ""a while"" and therefore ""it would be wrong to say it represents any view on negotiations"". However, it follows a marked ramp-up in high level discussions between the Prime Minister and fellow leaders, including telephone conversations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the European Council president Donald Tusk. :: How a no-deal vote could stop Brexit and make Jeremy Corbyn Prime Minister It comes as the remaining 27 EU countries prepare for ""internal preparatory discussions"" as to the European Union's future trading relationship with the UK after Brexit. This was seen in Whitehall as a softening of its stance on ""sequencing"" after refusing to move on to trade until sufficient progress was made on the so-called ""separation issues"": the divorce bill, the Irish border and EU citizens' rights. After the latest round of talks Mr Barnier said there was a ""very disturbing deadlock"" on the divorce bill. It is believed the Prime Minister will return to London before Thursday's council meeting to have more bilateral discussions with EU leaders. A European Commission source told Sky News that Mrs May, Mr Davis, Mr Barnier and Mr Juncker will meet at a ""working dinner"" where they ""will discuss European and geopolitical issues of common interest and prepare the European Council agenda and the long term G7/G20 agenda"". While Number 10 sources say such ""private meetings are standard practice"", the trip was only revealed to journalists on Sunday evening. Number 10 has taken a more hands-on role in the negotiation process since the former permanent secretary of the Department of Exiting the European Union, Olly Robbins, moved to Downing Street to coordinate the talks. It follows reports that Mr Robbins and Mr Davis had repeatedly clashed over strategy at the department."

The company's statement said it would be contacting the owners of the models affected shortly, but urged drivers not to use their vehicles as a precaution if the airbag warning light was lit in red on the dashboard. Mercedes said: ""If the steering column module clock spring is broken, the driver airbag warning light will be displayed in the instrument cluster, as well as a red airbag warning lamp. ""In rare circumstances, if the clock spring is broken and the wiring components are not sufficiently earthed this could lead to an electrostatic discharge which could inadvertently deploy the driver's airbag. ""Cars are safe to drive under normal operating conditions. ""If the airbag warning light comes on then customers should call Mercedes-Benz Roadside Assistance (00800 1777 7777), or contact their nearest retailer."" The company said the fault was not related to the scandal at Japanese airbag manufacturer, Takata, which has been linked to at least 19 deaths worldwide. Daimler-owned Mercedes told Sky News the problem was spotted through ""stringent checks"" but was currently unable to say whether there had been instances of airbags deploying in error under road conditions. It clarified that customers would be contacted by letter and a fix would be free of charge - adding the repair would take less than an hour to complete. Mercedes is one of the biggest players in the UK car market - behind the likes of Ford, Vauxhall, BMW and Volkswagen in market share terms. It sold 31,988 cars in the country last year."

He used many false identities to befriend more than 50 victims on internet marketplace sites such as Gumtree. Falder - who pleaded guilty to 137 charges at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday - persuaded them to send him naked or partially clothed pictures of themselves, then threatened them with exposure unless they went much further. He shared many of the images in sex abuse forums on the hidden dark web where he used identities including '666devil' and 'evil mind'. Falder targeted his victims for more than eight years and was eventually unmasked after the National Crime Agency brought in specialist help from GCHQ, the Government's communications spy centre, and other agencies. His victims were girls, boys, women and men. Some were so traumatised they self-harmed, or attempted suicide. His father Stephen Falder said: ""This has turned our lives upside down. It came as a complete shock and the family is totally devastated."" Falder's long-term girlfriend, a fellow Cambridge student with whom he had shared a home, was said to be struggling to cope with the revelations since his arrest in June. Falder, who grew up in a wealthy part of Cheshire, admitted charges including inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, causing a child to engage in sexual activity, voyeurism, making and distributing indecent images of children, fraud, blackmail and encouraging rape. Dozens more charges were ordered to be left on his file. Mike Hames, former head of Scotland Yard's Paedophile Squad, said: ""He is a very nasty and savage individual. Although his crimes were non-contact, they are very similar to hands-on abuse, by inducing his victims, by whatever means, into doing things they wouldn't normally do. ""And thereafter he would exercise his power over them to make them feel awful about themselves in many ways. It was a bit similar to rape."" Falder was arrested at Birmingham University where he worked as a post-doctoral researcher. During a long investigation by the National Crime Agency, investigators found that Falder had installed secret cameras to spy on more victims in compromising situations. Clever as he was, he had inadvertently filmed himself while setting up the hidden cameras. Matt Sutton, NCA senior investigating officer, said: ""In 30 years of law enforcement I have never come across such horrifying offending where the offender's sole aim was to cause such pain and distress. ""It has been an extremely complex investigation into a prolific online predator, who over several years believed he could evade law enforcement to sexually and sadistically exploit vulnerable victims. ""I urge anyone who is being abused online to talk to somebody, report it. There is help available."" A GCHQ spokesperson said: ""GCHQ is proud to have supported The National Crime Agency in this investigation. ""Working to counter this kind of terrible child sexual exploitation is an important part of our mission to help keep the UK safe online and protect the digital homeland."" A University of Cambridge spokesperson confirmed Falder was a student between 2007 and 2016 and said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the case. Falder will be sentenced on 7 December and is expected to be given a long jail term."

Video and pictures showed roofs being torn off buildings, flooding on coastlines and fire services reported scores of trees being felled and power lines being blown down. A woman in her 50s died close to the village of Aglish in County Waterford when a tree fell on to her car, while a man died in identical circumstances in Ravensdale, Dundalk. Another man died after being fatally injured by a chainsaw while he tried to clear a fallen tree in Cahir, Co Tipperary. All schools in Northern Ireland and the Republic were closed and will remain shut on Tuesday as officials assess damage. Ophelia is forecast to move north overnight and the Met Office has put out a yellow warning of very windy weather for Northern Ireland, northern England, central and southern Scotland, and northwest Wales until 3pm on Tuesday. There could be gusts of up to 70mph in parts of Scotland and northeast England. Sky News weather producer Chris England said: ""The worst of the gales will ease overnight, but there will still be the risk of some disruption in the north. ""The rain will become largely confined to Scotland, but there will be a few showers elsewhere, mainly over northern parts. ""Early rain over northern Scotland will give way to showers during Tuesday morning and the gales will gradually die out. ""Elsewhere, many places will be fine and dry, but there will be a few showers for southern Scotland, northern Ireland and the north of Ireland. ""Southern England may see the odd shower too, while more rain will move onto western Channel coasts around midday."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who chaired a meeting of his government's National Emergency Coordination Group, urged the public to stay safe, saying: ""The advice is: stay indoors until the storm passes. ""Whether that is at work, in their home or some other home, stay indoors. Check on neighbours and relatives."" ESB Networks said the loss of power to homes in the Republic had been an ""unprecedented"", with around 330,000 homes and businesses experiencing outages on Monday night. Some 180 flights were cancelled at Dublin Airport, and passengers using airports in Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Cork and Shannon were also advised to check the latest information before travelling. As Ophelia began to batter southern Ireland, dramatic footage showed a roof being blown off the Douglas Community School's gym in Cork. Meanwhile, pictures on Twitter showed the collapsed roof of one of the stands at Cork City's football stadium. Dozens of roads were also affected, with trees and crashed vehicles blocking some major routes including Dublin's M50 and several streets in the city centre. In parts of England, the sun appeared to turn red as Ophelia's winds pulled air and dust up from southern Europe and Africa."
2017-10-16,"At the beginning of August I found myself standing on a dock in Plymouth, staring at a 72ft-long expedition yacht called Sea Dragon, wondering whether I had been wise to take on this job.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/we-were-being-stalked-by-plastic-on-voyage-11084451,"A few months earlier I'd been sitting in my office in New York when the phone rang. It was my boss. ""There's a project I think you might be interested in,"" he said. :: Sky Ocean rescue: How to get involved Would I like to go on a month-long sailing expedition around the UK to find out more about the plastic in our oceans? Would I mind if it was with a group of strangers? Could I film it? Could I make it into a documentary? Maybe it would be a nice break from covering Donald Trump. I said yes. And then suddenly, it was happening. I couldn't really sail, not in the open ocean. Nor could I really film, not even on dry land, let alone on a boat. So my knees wobbled a bit as I boarded Sea Dragon and found my bunk. I was right to be nervous. To start with it was lovely. We got a warm welcome from Emily Penn and Lucy Gilliam, co-founders of Exxpedition. Their organisation runs women-only voyages that aim to raise awareness of plastics and toxins in our seas, and turn those who take part into the best possible advocates for ocean health. They've sailed all over the world, but both felt it was time to bring their cause home to the UK. Our brilliant professional crew; skipper Diane Reid, first mate Holly Vint and deck hand Kat Law, ran us through the sailing basics. Life jackets fitted, gear stowed in tiny lockers, go-pros charged, we set off from Plymouth in high spirits. Then we started throwing up. Woman by woman, the crew went down. Through the ocean we rolled, into the wind, around Land's End. It was like being in a washing machine. We ran out of spaces and places to vomit. Our professional crew knew it was coming, they had seen the forecast. They waited patiently and with sympathy as we retched and cried and wiped our faces. They put some of us to bed and encouraged some of us to power through it. It was the hardest thing I've done in a long time. But we made it to our first stop in Cardiff feeling less like a group of strangers and more like a team who'd faced adversity and come out the other side. As oceans advocate and sailor Emily Penn put it to me, rising to difficult challenges is part of the point. The health of our waters depends on it. And so our journey continued. We zipped across the Irish Sea as shooting stars danced above us and dolphins played at our bow. We motored under Tower Bridge, shared stories and meals, hoisted sails and ground winches. I started to understand why people get hooked on sailing. But at times it was far from joyful. It felt as if we were being stalked by plastic. A piece of what looked like food packaging got sucked into a water filter and nearly stopped our journey. We found clumps of balloons in the North Sea as we were searching for a diver that had gone missing. It was so sad to look for a human and find plastic instead. We seemed to pull the material out of every trawl we did. Sometimes it was microfibers only visible under a microscope. But some of the samples, especially from the Thames, were crunchy with micro-beads. It came up in the sediment we dredged from harbour bottoms. It was in the guts of an eel we found in our engine. It was everywhere. The act of bearing witness had a profound effect. Suddenly, we didn't know about the problem because we'd read an article or seen it on Instagram, we knew because we'd seen it with our own eyes. Management consultant Deborah Stott said simply ""You can't un-know this. We have to act."" The discoveries gave our public outreach efforts in port a new sense of urgency. At every place we docked, the crew tried to convince people to stop buying single-use plastic. We picked up litter from beaches and river banks, hearing it creak and snap under our feet. We listened to our land-based ambassadors Amy and Ella Meek plead with people to get ""plastic clever"" by replacing bottles, coffee cups, straws and bags with reusables. We met politicians, put on art displays, performance art at the Edinburgh Fringe… you name it, this crew of women tried it. It was genuinely inspiring to be a part of such an ambitious effort. It was also refreshing to talk to people honestly about how we can tackle the problem; how individuals can choose to consume differently, how big business needs to respond to the design challenge, and how policy makers must help us move in the right direction. As crew member and writer Sarah Tanburn said to me, change is never perfect, and incremental progress is infinitely preferable to none. The women on board Sea Dragon left with this ringing in our ears. We've returned to our families, friends and communities with a new understanding of what's at stake. The alterations we make to our lives as a result won't be perfect, or enough, on their own. But we're going to try. You can, too. :: Watch A Plastic Voyage on Sky Atlantic at 9pm on Tuesday and on Sky News on Wednesday at 9pm. :: To get involved in our Sky Ocean Rescue campaign, visit the website here."
2017-10-16,There were fewer people prosecuted for committing hate crimes last year despite a sharp rise in reported incidents following the EU referendum.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/hate-crimes-more-reports-but-fewer-prosecutions-11084616,"The figures reveal a total of 14,480 people were prosecuted for hate crimes in 2016-17 in England and Wales compared to 15,442 convictions completed in the previous year. Authorities could face fresh scrutiny of how they deal with complaints following the 6.2% drop in prosecutions - about a thousand fewer. The data on hate crime convictions covers offences perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or gender identity. Figures on the number of hate crime offences recorded by police for the full 12 months have not yet been published. But statistics released last year showed a sharp rise in racially or religiously aggravated offences reported to officers following the EU referendum in June. In the new report, the Crown Prosecution Service noted in 2016-17 there was a small increase of 0.7%, from 12,997 to 13,086, in the number of hate crime cases referred by police compared with the previous year. This rise followed a 9.6% drop in referrals from 2014-15 to 2015-16. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: ""The drop in referrals recorded last year has impacted on the number of completed prosecutions in 2016-17. ""And we are working with the police at a local and national level to understand the reasons for the overall fall in referrals in the past two years."" The number of reports also appeared to spike following the terror attacks that took place in the UK this year. The report also revealed how sentences for hate crimes were ""uplifted"" after applications by prosecutors in a record 6,306 cases. Ms Saunders said: ""Crimes motivated by hate have a corrosive effect on society and it is pleasing to see the courts are using their powers to increase sentences in the majority of cases for the first time."" Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, welcomed the ""tougher"" sentences but branded the fall in hate crime prosecutions ""troubling"". A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""All forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and the UK has some of the strongest laws in the world to tackle it. ""We are clear that the cowards who commit these hateful attacks should feel the full force of the law."""
2017-10-16,"Some energy companies are allowing households to build up arrears of more than £800 on their bills before intervening, according to Ofgem.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/energy-customers-building-up-800-in-debts-before-suppliers-act-11083501,"The regulator is urging suppliers to step in before customers find themselves with unmanageable levels of debt. Figures for the past year showed some companies were allowing unpaid bills to accrue before stepping in to put indebted customers on a repayment plan. Consumers now owe an average of £628 before they start paying back debt on their electricity accounts - a 7% increase on last year. For gas accounts, the figure was £622 - 5% higher than 12 months ago. Ofgem said some companies, including ""big six"" supplier npower, were performing ""significantly worse than the industry average"" by letting customers build up debts of more than £800 on electricity and gas bills. It called on the companies to ""reflect and act quickly"". Ofgem said npower, Utility Warehouse, Ecotricity, iSupplyEnergy and First Utility allowed customers to build up an average of more than £800 in electricity debt before they start paying it off. It also said npower, Utility Warehouse and Spark Energy allowed similar levels of debt on gas bills. Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, said: ""Paying off energy bills is a major concern for many customers in vulnerable situations. ""When suppliers let big debts accrue, it's a sign that they're not spotting debt or stepping in early enough to help customers who are struggling to pay bills. ""We want industry to demonstrate that it is identifying and supporting these customers in a timely way. ""We will be monitoring suppliers to make sure they make long-term improvements on bringing down debt."" Npower said: ""npower is committed to helping its most vulnerable customers and we go above and beyond our regulatory obligations to provide assistance to those who need it most."" It said Ofgem's report also pointed to good practice by the company. ""We will continue to work hard to ensure we're stepping in early enough to get these customers onto an appropriate debt repayment plan,"" the supplier added. Under new Ofgem rules, suppliers must identify vulnerable customers and show they have taken additional action to treat them fairly. The regulator's latest figures came in its annual report on how suppliers treat such customers, including those in debt and at risk of being disconnected. It found that, in some respects, suppliers were doing more to help - with more free gas safety tests and help in managing day-to-day energy use. Meanwhile, the number of disconnections because of debt fell to just 210 after reaching a peak of 8,300 a decade ago. Ofgem said the number of gas customers in debt has fallen by 9% to just over 970,000, while for electricity customers there was a fall of 3% to 1.2 million. It comes as the Government plans a cap on energy tariffs to protect households from rip-off bills."

It wanted a new owner in place by Christmas - ahead of the January transfer window. SJH's statement said the buyer would also be given help to invest in the side in the short term, should they need it, through the option of ""deferring substantial payments"". Mr Ashley, who has faced protests from fans over the level of investment in the side since he took over, has long argued that funds were limited because his cash is tied up in shares of Sports Direct. The colourful tycoon, who described himself as a power drinker during a court case this summer, has a majority shareholding of 55% in the FTSE 250 retailer, making him a billionaire - on paper at least. St James Holdings released a statement on Monday evening in response to media speculation that expressions of interest were being sought. It said: ""As one of the Premier League's oldest and best supported football clubs - and for the benefit of its many fans and supporters in the UK and across the world - Newcastle United requires a clear direction and a path to a bright and successful future. ""To give the club the best possible opportunity of securing the positioning and investment necessary to take it to the next level, at what is an important time in its history, its present ownership has determined that it is in the best interests of Newcastle United and its fans for the club to be put up for sale. ""To give an incoming owner the maximum possible flexibility to make meaningful investment in the club, including in its playing squad, the sale process will give interested parties the opportunity of deferring substantial payments. ""A process will now commence of identifying new ownership for the club that will be capable of delivering the sustained investment in and dedication to the club that is necessary for it to achieve its ambitions."" The side is currently ninth in the Premier League table on its return to the top flight following a single season in the Championship. Mr Ashley launched a formal takeover of Newcastle United in 2007 after becoming its biggest shareholder - later de-listing it from the London Stock Exchange. A previous sale of the club was halted in 2008."
2017-10-16,Europe's Airbus has announced it will acquire a majority stake in Bombardier's C-Series passenger jet business.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/airbus-to-partner-with-canadas-bombardier-11084622,"The agreement aims to allow Bombardier to make savings on production of the aircraft and to take advantage of Airbus's international reach to boost sales. Canadian firm Bombardier employs 4,000 people in Belfast where the wings for the C-Series are made. There have been fears for those jobs as the company is facing a 220% tariff on a new model of passenger jet and a second preliminary levy of 80% on the exports of its planes to the US. The dispute centres around claims from US firm Boeing that Bombardier received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada, allowing it to sell airliners at below-cost prices in the US. The new deal, if approved by regulators, would see Airbus get a 50.01% interest in Bombardier's C-Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP). Bombardier and Investissement Québec would own about 31% and 19% respectively. Airbus would provide procurement, sales and marketing, and customer support to the CSALP, the entity that makes and sells the jet. Airbus chief executive officer Tom Enders said: ""Not only will this partnership secure the C Series and its industrial operations in Canada, the UK and China, but we also bring new jobs to the US. ""I have no doubt that our partnership with Bombardier will boost sales and the value of this programme tremendously."" Alain Bellemare, president and chief executive officer of Bombardier, said: ""This partnership should more than double the value of the C-Series programme and ensures our remarkable game-changing aircraft realises its full potential."" The C-Series headquarters will remain in Montreal but a second assembly line will be set up at Airbus's facility in Alabama. Mr Enders said that an aircraft made in a US Airbus facility would not be subject to duties under the US case, AP reported. A Boeing spokesman said: ""This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidised competitors to skirt the recent findings of the US government."" :: How the battle for our skies landed in Belfast It was not clear how the partnership between Bombardier and Airbus might affect the tariff row but Northern Ireland political leaders welcomed the announcement. DUP leader Arlene Foster described it as ""incredibly significant news for Bombardier, Belfast and Northern Ireland"". She added: ""Airbus clearly recognise the value of the C Series. I welcome their interest and investment. ""Having personally supported the aircraft through its development, I'm thrilled there is a bright future ahead following what has been a dark time for staff and management. ""I hope this will safeguard the C Series programme."" East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson added: ""Over the last four months, our focus has been the Belfast workforce and securing a successful resolution to this ongoing dispute. ""Whilst there is some way to travel, we will offer our full support in securing the necessary regulatory approvals. The commitment to the Belfast facility is a testament to the ingenuity of the workforce. ""They should be proud that their valuable capability will continue to play a crucial role in C Series."""
2017-10-16,"The Great Storm of 1987 violently tore through the UK, and exactly 30 years on, the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia are on the way.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/ophelia-where-is-the-storm-going-to-hit-11082063,"Nobody, including Michael Fish, could have predicted the devastation caused by the storm that would ultimately claim 18 lives and cause more than £1bn worth of damage, but times have changed and warning systems are much better than they used to be. So, here's what you need to know about Ophelia: :: How powerful is it? The storm had briefly reached category three status - but it has now lost power and is no longer hurricane strength. It will reach Ireland and the UK as a very strong storm which will bring winds of up to 80mph. :: When is it due to arrive and which areas are likely to be most affected? The main part of the storm will arrive on Monday lunchtime. A red warning (meaning ""take action"" to protect yourself) is in place across Ireland. An amber alert (meaning ""potential for injuries and a danger to life"") is in place for Northern Ireland and parts of southwest Scotland and west Wales. A yellow warning (meaning ""be aware"") has been issued for Scotland and western parts of the UK. Other parts of England and Wales will be quite windy but won't feel the full impact of the storm. :: Is there a threat to life? Yes. Winds as strong as 80mph are capable of causing structural damage, downing power lines and uprooting trees, so it is important to be aware and travel only if necessary. It is best to follow official guidance when the storm arrives and the risks become clearer. :: Will it cause a lot of disruption? The storm will have an impact throughout Monday and even into Tuesday morning. Schools across Ireland have been closed and there is disruption to transport. The Met Office says road, rail, air and ferry services across the UK may be affected. :: Should we be worried? Don't be worried - but it is important to be aware, read the official guidance and check weather broadcasts when the storm arrives."

I understand that leaving was against the law."" He could be jailed for life for the misbehaviour charge, while the offence of desertion carries a maximum term of five years. :: Bergdahl asks Obama for pardon A Navy Seal and an Army National Guard were seriously wounded in attempts to rescue him from his captors - incidents that will influence his sentence. Sgt Bergdahl, who is accused of endangering his comrades by abandoning his post, admitted wrongdoing but said he never intended to put anyone at risk. ""I didn't think there'd be any reason to pull off a crucial mission to look for one guy,"" he said, adding his actions were ""very inexcusable"". He was captured by the Taliban hours after walking off his remote observation post in June 2009 in a move which he said was aimed at drawing attention to what he saw as problems with his unit. During his trial, he told how he was tortured in captivity, including spending years either locked in a cage or chained on all fours. Nonetheless, he said he made ""somewhere between a dozen and 15 escape attempts"". Former US president Barack Obama brought him home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, saying the US does not leave its service members on the battlefield. The move was fiercely criticised by his Republican opponents and especially Donald Trump. While campaigning for president, the businessman repeatedly called Bergdahl a ""dirty, rotten traitor"" who deserved to be executed by firing squad or thrown out of a plane without a parachute. By admitting his guilt, Sgt Bergdahl, who chose to have his case heard by a judge rather than a jury, appears to be hoping for leniency. But the serious wounds to the colleagues searching for him are expected to influence the sentence and his defence team failed in a bid to convince judge Army Colonel Jeffrey Nance that President Trump's criticism had swayed the case. The five years Sergeant Bergdahl spent in captivity is likely to be borne in mind in sentencing by the judge, who has accepted his plea. The sentencing hearing is expected to start on 23 October."

When asked about reports he was guilty of ""mansplaining"" - talking down to a woman in a patronising way - Sir Mark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""No, it's not a report that I recognise, and she wouldn't recognise either."" He said that while there had been tensions, they were the kind of tensions that occur in such a high-level environment. The Eton-educated, ex-British ambassador to the UN added: ""I had a very good relationship with David Cameron. I had a very good relationship with Theresa May. Obviously, when you work in Downing Street there are tensions. ""And there were some tensions, I have to say, with some of her political advisers in Downing Street, who are no longer in Downing Street now. ""And that can lead to some tensions. But, no, my job was to speak truth unto power. My job was to give the best possible advice I could and I always did that."" Reports emerged late last year saying that Mrs May was frustrated by Sir Mark's behaviour during meetings. He is said to have talked over her. He was appointed by David Cameron in 2015, having previously been the UK's top diplomat at the United Nations for six years. Asked whether the tensions resulted in him standing down, the 61-year-old said: ""No. I was always planning to leave this year, and I did leave this year."" Talking about the consequences of a hard border in Northern Ireland, if no deal can be reached after Brexit, he said it ""could potentially be serious for security"". But he said he believed the UK, the Irish Republic and the EU are committed to resolving the issue. He added that he saw no reason why it would not be possible to reach a post-Brexit deal on security issues with European countries as the UK was a major player in defence and intelligence."

Colony will inject cash into the company while discussions continue over it buying all or part of the Weinstein firm. :: UK police investigating five Weinstein sex assault claims:: Corden sorry for Weinstein jokes The torrent of accusations against Harvey Weinstein had raised questions about the future of the company he founded. On Friday, his brother Bob denied suggestions the company would be closed or sold, saying it was ""business as usual"". Lina Esco, Actress She says Weinstein told her: ""I think we should see a movie in the theatre, like back in the day, and we should kiss."" She allegedly brushed him off but he pressed on and forcefully tries to kiss her. ""It's just a kiss,"" he allegedly said. Minka Kelly, Actress After meeting to Weinstein at a party, Kelly claims he set up a ""general meeting"" via her agent in his hotel room. ""He said: 'I know you were feeling what I was feeling when we met the other night' and then regaled me with offers of a lavish life filled with trips around the world on private planes etc. - If I would be his girlfriend."" Lysette Anthony, Actress The British actress, who now stars in Hollyoaks, accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her in the 1980s. She told the Sunday Times: ""He pushed me inside and rammed me against the coat rack. He was trying to kiss me and shove inside me. Finally I just gave up.""

Subkoff told Page Six she then felt ""that he had an erection"". Angie Everhart, Model Everhart told a radio station she was sleeping in her bedroom on a yacht at a European film festival when she awoke to find Weinstein standing over her and masturbating. Eva Green, Actress ""I wish to address comments made by my mother in a recent interview regarding Harvey Weinstein. I met him for a business meeting in Paris at which he behaved inappropriately and I had to push him off. I got away without it going further, but the experience left me shocked and disgusted. I have not discussed this before because I wanted to maintain my privacy, but I understand it is important to do so as I hear about other women's experiences. Women are often condemned when they speak out and their personal reputations tarnished by association. I salute the great bravery of the women who have come forward. We should recognise that this sort of behaviour exists everywhere and is not unique to the entertainment industry. The exploitation of power is ubiquitous. This behaviour is unacceptable and needs to be eliminated."" Claire Forlani, Actress ""You see, nothing happened to me with Harvey - by that I mean, I escaped 5 times. I had two Peninsula Hotel meetings in the evening with Harvey and all I remember was I ducked, dived and ultimately got out of there without getting slobbered over, well just a bit. Yes, massage was suggested. The three dinners with Harvey I don't really remember the time period, I was 25. I remember him telling me all the actresses who had slept with him and what he had done for them."" Kate Beckinsale, Actress In a statement released to her Instagram the actress accused Weinstein showing up to a meeting in a bathrobe and offered her alcohol when she was 17.

""I went to a meeting with him in the lobby of a hotel with a director about an upcoming film. ""The director left the meeting and Harvey asked me to stay and chat with him. As soon as we were alone he began to brag about all the actresses he had slept with and how he had made their careers and spoke about other inappropriate things of a sexual nature. ""He then invited me to his room. I quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside. She said it wasn't and wouldn't be for a bit and I should go to his room. ""At that moment I felt very powerless and scared but didn't want to act that way hoping that I was wrong about the situation. ""When I arrived I was relieved to find another woman in his room and thought immediately I was safe. ""He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction. I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing....i thought it would make the situation better....more professional....like an audition....i was so nervous. ""After singing I said again that I had to leave. He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room."" Lea Seydoux, Actress The French star who stars in James Bond film Skyfall wrote an article in the Guardian saying: ""He suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself.

Rosanna Arquette, Actress Weinstein allegedly tried to put Pulp Fiction actress Rosanna Arquette's hand on his penis. When she rejected him, she claimed he said she was ""making a big mistake"".

Emma de Caunes, Actress In 2010, Weinstein allegedly showed his penis and demanded sex from French actress Emma de Caunes after a business meeting. Lauren O'Connor, Executive Lauren O'Connor, a former employee of Weinstein, wrote a memo about his actions, saying she felt ""sexualised and diminished"".

Although it is likely to mean one of the great powerhouses of Hollywood remains in existence for the immediate future, major changes are almost certain to take place. The Weinstein Company, founded by the brothers in 2005, is behind Hollywood blockbusters including Django Unchained, The King's Speech and Silver Linings Playbook. In a statement, Mr Barrack said: ""We will help return the company to its rightful iconic position in the independent film and television industry."" A billionaire who made his fortune in real estate, Mr Barrack was the chairman of Mr Trump's presidential inauguration committee. He previously bought another Weinstein creation, Miramax, and saved Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch from ruin. As allegations piled up against Mr Weinstein on both sides of the Atlantic, shareholders and business partners of The Weinstein Company had begun to question their continuing involvement with the firm. Amazon Studios and director Oliver Stone were among them. Weinstein himself has been fired from the company he founded, although it has been reported he will make representations at a board meeting this week that his firing was unlawful. :: The Critics: Woody Allen, Director ""No one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness. And they wouldn't, because you are not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie. But you do hear a million fanciful rumours all the time. And some turn out to be true and some - many - are just stories about this actress, or that actor. The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved. Tragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that is life is so messed up. There's no winners in that, it's just very, very sad and tragic for those poor women that had to go through that."" Tom Hanks, Actor ""Look, I don't want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can't buy, 'Oh, well, I grew up in the '60s and '70s and so therefore' - I did, too. So I think it's like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can."" Ryan Gosling, Actor ""I want to add my voice of support for the women who have had the courage to speak out against Harvey Weinstein. Like most people in Hollywood, I have worked with him and I'm deeply disappointed in myself for being so oblivious to these devastating experiences of sexual harassment and abuse. He is emblematic of a systemic problem. Men should stand with women and work together until there is real accountability and change."" Emma Thompson, Actress ""I don't think you can describe him as a sex addict. He's a predator - that's different. He's at the top of, as it were, the ladder of, a system of harassment and belittlement and bullying and interference. This has been part of our world, women's world, since time immemorial."" Bob Weinstein, Harvey's brother and the co-founder of The Weinstein Company ""My brother has caused unconscionable suffering. As a father of three girls I say this with every bone in my body - I am heartbroken for the women that he has harmed,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. ""I'm ashamed that he is my brother, to be honest, and I am ashamed that these are his actions."" He added: ""I'm mortified and disgusted by my brother's actions. And I am sick for the victims."" ""It's unbelievable that even to this moment he is more concerned with who sold him out. I don't hear concern or contrition for the victims."" Colin Farrell, Actor ""I'm just watching it unfold and then tearing myself away from it and realising the horribleness of it all and the wrongdoing, fundamentally, around the whole thing and just wish healing for everyone and that changes are made. I hope anyone who was hurt that they have healing. It's just atrocious, really."" Carey Mulligan, Actress ""Thank God it's all coming out, it's horrific. And thank God it's coming to the fore and these incredible women are feeling brave enough to be able to come forward and say something about it."" Colin Firth, Actor ""She told me she had had a distressing encounter with Harvey Weinstein,"" Firth told the Guardian about one of the accusers, Sophie Dix. ""I don't think she went into all the horrific detail I've read in her interview. But I remember her being profoundly upset by it. To my shame, I merely expressed sympathy. I didn't act on what she told me. It was a long time ago and I don't know if she remembers telling me, but the fact that I had that conversation has come back to haunt me in the light of these revelations. It's the only direct account of this kind of behaviour by Harvey Weinstein that's ever been told to me."" Kelly MacDonald, Actress ""He needs to be locked up - that's the main thing. He seems to have behaved in a way that you would think that's the very least that should happen."" Paris Hilton, Socialite ""Growing up in Hollywood I've experienced that a lot. I think when someone is in power then they are able to do that - so I think it's really brave of these women to be speaking out and to start a movement to stop this. Because it happens way too often."" Anette Bening, Actress ""Perhaps now that this has been uncovered, things will change. Maybe men will understand things better and young women as well. It is very, very important that they spoke out."" James Van Der Beek, Actor ""For anyone judging the women who stayed silent, read this for perspective. Also for anyone brushing off harassment as 'boys being boys'. What Weinstein is being accused of is criminal. What he's admitted to is unacceptable - in any industry. I applaud everybody speaking out. I've had my ass grabbed by older, powerful men, I've had them corner me ininappropriate sexual conversations when I was much younger... I understand the unwarranted shame, powerlessness & inability to blow the whistle. There's a power dynamic that feels impossible to overcome."" Ewan McGregor, Actor ""It's about time this came to light and he is getting just deserts. Heard rumours over the years but this is awful. Bye Bully!"" Brie Larson, Actress ""As always, I stand with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment. It's not your fault. I believe you."" Jeff Bridges, Actor ""Talk about facing your fear, he's gotta face his demons now. I wish him the best of luck with that, he needs to lean in and really face those things."" Benedict Cumberbatch, Actor ""I am utterly disgusted by the continuing revelations of Harvey Weinstein's horrifying and unforgivable actions. We need to collectively stand up and support victims of abuse such as the brave and inspiring women who have spoken out against him and say we hear you and believe you. That way others may be emboldened by our support to come forward and speak. But we shouldn't wait until there are any more stories like this. We, as an industry and as a society at large, need to play our part. There has to be zero tolerance of any such behaviour in any walk of life. We owe that to these women's bravery in coming forward."" Leonardo DiCaprio, Actor ""There is no excuse for sexual harassment or sexual assault - no matter who you are and no matter what profession. I applaud the strength and courage of the women who came forward and made their voices heard."" Michelle and Barack Obama, Former US First Lady/President ""Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status."" Emmy Rossum, Actress ""The 'old dinosaur' explanation doesn't cut it. Decades of using power to intimidate women for sexual gain is reprehensible and inexcusable."" Judd Apatow, Director ""What Harvey Weinstein did was abhorrent. He admits he did it. Why should anyone be silent in their disgust and support for his victims?"" Patricia Arquette, Actress ""If there is a way to cure yourself of being a predator than I hope Harvey learns what it is & shares it with the world. It's an epidemic."" Michael Keaton, Actor ""H Weinstein - yikes! Disgusting and creepy. So is 'leader of the free world', by the way."" Kevin Smith, Director ""He financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed."" Jessica Chastain, Actress ""I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an environment for it to happen again."" Mark Ruffalo, Actor ""To be clear what Harvey Weinstein did was a disgusting abuse of power and horrible. I hope we are now seeing the beginning of the end of these abuses."" Lena Dunham, Actress ""Easy to think Weinstein company took swift action but this has actually been the slowest action because they always always knew."" Julianne Moore, Actress ""Coming forward about sexual abuse and coercion is scary and women have nothing to be gained personally by doing so. But through their bravery we move forward as a culture, and I thank them. Stand with Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and others."" Judy Dench, Actress ""Whilst there is no doubt that Harvey Weinstein has helped and championed my film career for the past 20 years, I was completely unaware of these offences which are, of course, horrifying, and I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out."" Glenn Close, Actress ""I'm sitting here, deeply upset, acknowledging to myself that, yes, for many years, I have been aware of the vague rumours that Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of behaving inappropriately around women. Harvey has always been decent to me, but now that the rumours are being substantiated, I feel angry and darkly sad. I'm angry, not just at him and the conspiracy of silence around his actions, but also that the ""casting couch"" phenomenon, so to speak, is still a reality in our business and in the world: the horrible pressure, the awful expectation put on a woman when a powerful, egotistical, entitled bully expects sexual favors in exchange for a job. Ours is an industry in which very few actors are indispensable and women are cast in far fewer roles than men, so the stakes are higher for women and make them more vulnerable to the manipulations of a predator. I applaud the monumental courage of the women who have spoken up. I hope that their stories and the reportage that gave them their voices represents a tipping point, that more stories will be told and that change will follow. The changes must be both institutional and personal. Men and women, in positions of power, must create a work environment in which people, whose jobs depend on them, feel safe to report threatening and inappropriate behaviour, like that reported in the Times. No one should be coerced into trading personal dignity for professional success. I feel the time is long and tragically overdue for all of us in the industry, women and men, to unite - calmly and dispassionately - and create a new culture of respect, equality and empowerment, where bullies and their enablers are no longer allowed to prosper."" Meryl Streep, Actress ""The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes. One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn't know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And if everybody knew, I don't believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it. The behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game."" Kate Winslet, Actress ""His behaviour is without question disgraceful and appalling and very, very wrong. I had hoped that these kind of stories were just made up rumours, maybe we have all been naive."" Jennifer Lawrence, Actress ""I was deeply disturbed to hear the news about Harvey Weinstein's behaviour. This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting."" George Clooney, Actor ""I suppose the argument would be that it's not just about Hollywood, but about all of us - that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don't speak up, you're complicit."" Ben Affleck, Actor ""I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades."" Matt Damon, Actor ""As the father of four daughters, this is the kind of sexual predation that keeps me up at night. This is the great fear for all of us. I did five or six movies with Harvey. I never saw this. I feel horrible for these women and it's wonderful they have this incredible courage and are standing up now. We can all feel this change that's happening, which is necessary and overdue."" Nicole Kidman, Actress ""As I've stated before publicly, I support and applaud all women and these women who speak out against any abuse and misuse of power - be it domestic violence or sexual harassment in the workforce. We need to eradicate this behaviour."" The producer is reported to be attending a rehab centre in Arizona. At the weekend, the one-time Oscar grandee was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Police in New York and London are examining allegations against him dating back to the 1980s. The Weinstein Company has seen a number of its directors quit in the wake of the revelations about their most high-profile colleague. :: The Defenders: Oliver Stone, Director ""I'm a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial. I believe a man shouldn't be condemned by a vigilante system. It's not easy what he's going through, either."" He later said: ""After looking at what has been reported in many publications over the last couple of days, I'm appalled and commend the courage of the women who've stepped forward to report sexual abuse or rape."" Lindsay Lohan, Actress ""I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now, I don't think it's right what's going on. I think Georgina [Chapman] needs to take a stand and be there for her husband. He's never harmed me or did anything to me - we've done several movies together. I think everyone needs to stop - I think it's wrong. So stand up."" Donna Karan, Fashion Designer ""I think we have to look at ourselves. Obviously, the treatment of women all over the world is something that has always had to be identified. Certainly in the country of Haiti where I work, in Africa, in the developing world, it's been a hard time for women. To see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality? And what are we throwing out to our children today about how to dance and how to perform and what to wear? How much should they show? Yes, I think he's being looked at right now as a symbol, not necessarily as him. I know his wife, I think they're wonderful people, Harvey has done some amazing things. I think we have to look at our world and what we want to say and how we want to say it as well. You look at everything all over the world today and how women are dressing and what they are asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble."" Those remaining are publicly confident about the company's future. Board member Tarak Ben Ammar said: ""We believe that Colony's investment and sponsorship will help stabilise the company's current operations as well as provide comfort to our critical distribution, production and talent partners around the world."" Weinstein has ""unequivocally denied"" all allegations of unlawful behaviour."
2017-10-16,"When compared with political nicknames such as Iron Lady, Tarzan or Grand Old Man, the sobriquet of Spreadsheet Phil doesn't shine.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/is-chancellor-philip-hammond-heading-for-the-sack-11082684,"But it does at least ring true about the incumbent Chancellor, Philip Hammond: patrician, restrained, even dour. He makes an unlikely lightning rod for fury. Yet this week barely a day has passed without Hammond attracting the ire of his colleagues. He has become the de facto ringmaster of the Tory Remainers. He is privately and publicly scornful of his Brexiteer colleagues. He considers them to be out of touch with economic and commercial reality. He has become the go-to voice for the City and big business in the Cabinet, who argue for as little change as possible. Hence this week his reluctance to commit to spend Treasury money on tasking the civil service to prepare for a no-deal scenario with Brussels. He said it would be wrong to do so ""just to make some demonstration point"". This enraged the Brexiteers. They suspect foul play, that he's trying to frustrate Brexit. Consequently one of Hammond's predecessors, Nigel Lawson, told me on Thursday that he was ""damaging the country"" and that Theresa May should sack him. Many MPs agreed. And today, The Sunday Telegraph's front page told us that the DUP are similarly incensed. The paper says senior DUP parliamentary sources have said they are ""extremely concerned about Philip Hammond's behaviour"" and that he is ""trying to frustrate the Brexit process"". The article claims the DUP source has said Theresa May must sack him if he doesn't change his tune. Given Mrs May is Prime Minister only because of their 10 seats, this is no insignificant threat. But is it true? I have my doubts. For a start, although the DUP are arch-Brexiteers, they are most certainly not ""no-dealers"". They know more than anyone how damaging a hard border would be for Northern Ireland. That is what would return if Britain cannot reach an accommodation with the EU. Indeed, the DUP told Sky's David Blevins on Sunday morning that they do not recognise the comments attributed to them by the Telegraph. There is mischief afoot. And I wonder whether some of the more extreme stories being pumped into the press this week about Hammond might not have the fingerprints of team Boris Johnson. Let's not forget, only a week ago it was his future, not the Chancellor's, which was on everyone's lips. And maybe that's not surprising, for they have each, in their own way, come to epitomise one wing of their party: the hard Remainers and hard Leavers respectively. Consequently, each side is calling for the other's captain to get the sack. Precisely for this reason, I suspect in the end, May will choose not to move either. Reshuffling either a chancellor or foreign secretary is a big step even for a powerful PM. For a weak one, in a situation where both would probably choose to return to the backbenches rather than be moved, it could be lethal. Especially given the wider Brexit politics. :: UKIP leader - I could strangle a badger:: 'Brexit makes hard Irish border inevitable' Moving one but not the other would disrupt the extremely delicate equilibrium between the factions in the Tory Europe civil war. And moving both? Maybe even worse - it might actually be the one thing to bring them together. Much better to leave them and create space for new blood lower down the cabinet pecking order. After all, in some ways, who is the person who suffers most from a wounded chancellor and foreign secretary? A wounded prime minister, worried for her job."
2017-10-16,There's been an unpleasant crumpling of paper and packaging shares following a profits warning from Mondi.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/mondi-profit-warning-sees-shares-in-paper-and-packaging-firm-crumple-11076462,"You may not have heard of this company but, courtesy of its membership of the FTSE 100, the chances are that you will indirectly own shares in it via tracker funds held by your life policy, pension fund or ISA. For Mondi is a business with a stock market value - even after the latest profit alert - of £10bn. And while its origins are in South Africa and its corporate headquarters are in Vienna, it operates out of no fewer than 40 locations in the UK, including manufacturing sites at Deeside, North Wales, Nelson in Lancashire and Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire. It used to be bigger still in Britain, having until 2012 owned the newsprint supplier Aylesford, whose paper was used by titles including The Times, the Daily Mirror and The Observer. Previously part of Anglo American, the international mining giant, it was spun off as a separate business as its own right in 2007 and has spent most of the intervening period in the FTSE 100. It has not been a bad investment, either, with the shares delivering a 322% return during that period compared with one of just 20% from the FTSE All Share index. This has been bolstered by rapid growth in recent years following acquisitions in a number of countries and, in particular, emerging markets in Asia and central and Eastern Europe. During the last four years alone, Mondi has spent €1.6bn (£1.4bn) on acquisitions, with more deals promised. These, in theory, should be boom times for Mondi. Paper and packaging sounds relatively unglamorous as a business activity yet, as globalisation swells the ranks of the middle classes in markets like India and Turkey, more people are buying more things - and that means more paper and packaging. The rise of e-commerce in developed markets, meanwhile, has also created a demand for packaging. Accordingly, the company has grown full year operating profits from €547m in 2012 to €943m last year, with sales also rising solidly in that time. So what appears to have gone wrong now? Well, a couple of things. Firstly, the company has been caught out by currency issues, chiefly the US dollar - the weakest-performing major currency this year - and a fall in the Turkish lira. At the same time, input costs have also bitten, with Mondi citing higher wood, energy and chemical costs than in the same period last year. The price of recycled paper, which is being demanded by increasing numbers of customers for environmental reasons, was up 15% during the third quarter of the year from the corresponding period a year ago. There have also been closures, for maintenance, of some of the company's paper mills. The company added: ""Continuing cost pressures and negative currency impacts are expected to result in an underlying performance for the year modestly below market expectations."" That has been enough to send shares of Mondi down by nearly 8% and also drag down shares of other packaging firms, including Smurfit Kappa, the Irish packaging giant which is also in the FTSE 100 and DS Smith, the British group that sits just outside the index. Should investors panic? Probably not. Yes, sentiment in companies like this is always going to be influenced by short-term currency fluctuations and short-term price movements that - as has been seen - can blow profitability off-course for one or two quarters. Yet this is a company that, for many years, has enjoyed industry-beating returns and which is operating in an industry in which big is beautiful and which is consolidating. It is also operating in a sector where, as DS Smith has shown, innovation is prized by customers. Mondi recently bought Excelsior, a British business that has a reputation for coming up with bright ideas in food packaging, an area in which Mondi has previously not had much of a presence - but in which, with its strong global distribution, it could easily roll out innovative products and gain market share quickly. Those investors of a short-term persuasion may well have thrown their share certificates in the waste-paper basket. Others taking a longer-term view will keep them on their desk under the paper-weight."

Crowds had expected to see Prince William and Prince Harry turn up as part of an event for some of the children's charities they support, but Kate stole the show when she turned up unannounced. Paddington Bear at first appeared to ask Prince Harry if he wanted to dance, but when he said no, Kate took the bear's hand and started twirling and shimmying away on the platform. Kate, who is pregnant with her third child, is still understood to be suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe form of morning sickness Still in character, the actor inside the bear costume, said: ""She's a right good mover, and I think she could win Strictly Come Dancing - if she was in it."" The dance routine happened as the royal trio joined stars of the new Paddington II movie, including Hugh Bonneville, to wave off a group of children who were taking a day trip on a steam train from Paddington station. The children were selected by members of the royal trio's Charities Forum - with many going through difficult times in their lives. One of the children managed to get Prince William to reveal that one of Prince George's favourite movies is the Lion King. Talking to the little boy William said, ""He quite likes the Lion King, he's watched that few times, what else does he like, he quite likes Octonauts, have you seen that? ""He's also watched some Lego Movies as well, he's watched a lot of things like that. ""Trying to keep him off television is quite hard work. Not too much TV!"""

But anyone who was not due to return home in that period was not included in the programme. The CAA said around 1,000 still abroad whose flights were covered by the industry's ATOL guarantee will be contacted to arrange alternatives. But administrators KPMG said a total of 4,000 remained overseas, including some who had gone away for planned lengthy stays abroad. That figure suggested 3,000 are not covered by the guarantee and will have to arrange their own way home. The collapse of Monarch, the UK's fifth biggest airline, prompted what was described as the UK's ""biggest peacetime repatriation"" with 110,000 expected to be flown back. In the end, less than 85,000 passengers were involved, on 576 flights. The CAA said that was partly because some chose to make their own arrangements to return to the UK, while in other cases tour companies brought back their own passengers. A third group were not eligible for repatriation because they had travelled out after 2 October - the day Monarch went into administration. The CAA said the two-week programme ended when a flight from Tel Aviv landed at Luton Airport at 3.30am on Monday. In all, more than 60 aircraft from 27 global airlines were involved, bringing passengers from more than 30 destinations in 14 countries to six airports in the UK. CAA chief executive Andrew Haines said: ""This was not a job that any of us wanted to do but we are pleased to have all played our part in Britain's largest peacetime repatriation."" Nearly 2,000 people were made redundant after Monarch's collapse while 750,000 people yet to travel had their trips cancelled. The Transport Secretary used the conclusion of the rescue flights to join calls for Monarch's private equity owner, Greybull Capital, to contribute funds to the £60m repatriation."
2017-10-16,Theresa May could have retained her House of Commons majority if June's snap General Election had been fought on a proposed shake-up of MPs' constituencies.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-would-have-kept-tory-majority-under-boundaries-plan-11084575,"An analysis of plans to cut the number of parliamentary seats, from 650 to 600, reveals if the vote had been held on a new list of constituencies the Conservatives may well have won an overall majority - rather than have to rely on the DUP's support to rule as a minority administration. The research, carried out for Sky News, the BBC, ITV News and the Press Association, suggests the Tories would have enjoyed a majority of 16; or effectively 25 if Sinn Fein were assumed not to take up their seats. Conducted by Professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, emeritus professors of politics at the University of Plymouth and associate members of Nuffield College, Oxford, the work will pressure the Prime Minister to push for boundary changes before the next General Election. However, the seats shake-up - the latest version of which has been proposed by boundary commissions in England, Wales and Scotland - is unlikely to get through Parliament due to Mrs May's lack of majority and fierce resistance from Opposition parties. :: North London battle for Labour MPs Labour signalled their rejection of the latest proposals to alter the UK's constituencies, as it was revealed Jeremy Corbyn could face a battle with some of his closest left-wing allies to stay in Parliament. The Labour leader's constituency is set to be axed under the plans, potentially plunging him into a fight with parliamentary neighbours Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, and Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary. Mr Corbyn, who has represented Islington North for 34 years, and his shadow cabinet allies are under threat because of a major shake-up of seats in north London. The Labour leader bitterly attacked the proposal to scrap his own seat when it was first announced last year, claiming it was based on an out-of-date version of the electoral register. At the moment, Ms Thornberry is MP for Islington South and Finsbury and Ms Abbott is MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington. The new plans propose a single Islington seat and a new Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington constituency. Meg Hillier, MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, could also be drawn into the battle. So too could David Lammy, the high-profile MP for Tottenham, and Kate Osamor, the Corbyn-backing shadow international development secretary and Edmonton MP. The plans could even possibly have an impact on Sir Keir Starmer, MP for Holborn and St Pancras and the shadow Brexit secretary, who is tipped by some Labour MPs as a potential party leader. :: Top Tories could go head-to-head The revised constituency list by the Boundary Commission for England also spells trouble for Boris Johnson, whose Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency faces the threat of abolition. For the Foreign Secretary, unless the proposals to axe his seat are overturned, his best hope is to switch to a new constituency of Hillingdon and Uxbridge, which includes large parts of his old seat. Tory MPs could also be forced to go head-to-head in Essex, where the county faces losing one MP. International Development Secretary Priti Patel and rising star James Cleverly may have to fight for the same seat. :: SNP and DUP badly hit The SNP, many of whose MPs have tiny majorities after June's election, are badly hit by plans by the Boundary Commission for Scotland to redraw the political map north of the border. The seat of the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, the Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency formerly represented by the late Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, is axed as Highland constituencies are cut from three to two. Also due to disappear is the SNP's former deputy leader Stewart Hosie's Dundee East seat, largely absorbed into a proposed Angus South and Dundee East constituency. Wales is set to lose 11 of its 40 seats and the Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, whose majority in Vale of Glamorgan in June was only a little over 2,000, is likely to be in difficulty. In Northern Ireland, the proposals are bad news for the Unionist parties - meaning they will be bitterly opposed by the Tories' Commons allies the DUP - and good news for Sinn Fein. Cutting the number of MPs to 600 was originally proposed by David Cameron when he was Opposition leader at the height of the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009. It was dropped after opposition from Mr Cameron's partners in the Coalition Government, the Liberal Democrats, and some Tory MPs. But it was in the Conservative manifesto in both 2015 and this year. There will now be an eight-week consultation on the shake-up, lasting until 11 December, which is likely to see political parties and individual MPs raising strong objections to many of the proposed changes. But, backing the shake-up, the Government's Constitution minister Chris Skidmore said: ""A boundary review is needed to ensure fair and equal representation for the voting public across the UK by the next general election. ""Without any boundary reforms, constituencies would be based on data that is over 20 years old. ""This would disregard significant changes in demographics, house building and migration."" Cat Smith MP, Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, said: ""Labour stands ready to work with all parties to ensure that a boundary review can go ahead in a way that benefits our democracy, not just the Conservative Party. ""However it has been clear from the start that the Tories have only been interested in their own political advantage rather than what is in the best interests of the country.""And the Liberal Democrat chief whip Alistair Carmichael called on the Government to stop wasting money on a ""dead-duck"" boundary review and scrap it.""The DUP will not wear this review,"" said Mr Carmichael. ""Nor will many Tory backbenchers. The Government should stop wasting public funds and bow to the inevitable."""

James Okulaja, a 14-year-old anti-bullying ambassador for The Diana Award, said: ""My role is to go round schools and educate people on what it means to be an 'Upstander', which essentially is standing up to bullying and not watching it happen. ""Anti-bullying ambassadors educate others about how to stay safe and what to do if they see bullying online - about the reporting buttons, how to block and filter comments, and also where to go if you need help."""

2017-10-16,Scientists have established how heavy elements such as gold and uranium trace their beginnings back to the collision of massive neutron stars.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171017011356/http://news.sky.com/story/scientists-discover-incredible-origin-of-gold-to-herald-new-chapter-in-astrophysics-11083888,"There were only two phenomena which scientists thought were capable of producing the extraordinary gravitational forces needed to forge the heaviest elements in the universe. A supernova, when a massive star collapses in its old age and explodes under its own weight, was considered possible. The other option was the merger of neutron stars - tiny stars of incredible mass - which would result in an enormous spray of stellar debris. Astrophysicists have now proved the latter after a gravitational wave signal, named GW170817, was detected at 1.41pm UK time on 17 August. So catastrophically powerful was the collision between two neutron stars - measuring about 12km in diameter each - that it made ripples in the very fabric of the universe, leading to the fifth detection of gravitational waves on Earth. Scientists ""heard"" the collision by measuring vibrations in space-time and used telescopes to monitor the radiation from the collision, which they called a ""kilonova"". As telescopes - both on Earth and on satellites - turned towards the collision, which took place 130 million years ago, they were able to analyse the light to see what elements were being produced. Astronomers have spoken of the discovery that kilonova is responsible for creating the majority of elements such as gold as opening a ""new chapter in astrophysics"". Dr Joe Lyman, from the University of Warwick, said: ""The exquisite observations obtained in a few days showed we were observing a kilonova, an object whose light is powered by extreme nuclear reactions. ""This tells us that the heavy elements, like the gold or platinum in jewellery, are the cinders, forged in the billion degree remnants of a merging neutron star."" Dr Samantha Oates, also from the University of Warwick, said: ""This discovery has answered three questions that astronomers have been puzzling for decades. ""What happens when neutron stars merge? What causes the short duration gamma-ray bursts? Where are the heavy elements, like gold, made? ""In the space of about a week all three of these mysteries were solved."" Professor Laura Cadonati, from Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo), which first observed gravitational waves in 2015, said: ""This detection has genuinely opened the doors to a new way of doing astrophysics. ""I expect it will be remembered as one of the most studied astrophysical events in history."""

Emile Cilliers, 37, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps in Aldershot, denies the attempted murder of his wife, a former Army officer. Cilliers, an army fitness instructor, is also accused of a third charge of damaging a gas valve at the couple's home a few days before her jump, as part of a second alleged murder attempt. He denies all the charges. The prosecution alleges that Cilliers tampered with his wife's parachute the day before her jump with the Army Parachute Association (APA) by twisting the lines of the main parachute and removing two of the four links. A chief rigger at the APA, George Panagopoulos, told the court that Cilliers, a qualified main parachute packer, went on an advanced reserve packing course in 2012. Mr Panagopoulos said he acquired ""100%"" knowledge of assembling and packing reserve parachutes. Also giving evidence at the trial at Winchester Crown Court, Justin ""Kenny"" Everett, a former member of the Royal Artillery parachute display team known as the Black Knights, said he was working as the drop zone controller at the time of Mrs Cilliers' fall. He said when he spoke to Mrs Cilliers before the jump she had ""seemed normal, didn't seem any different to normal"". But he said that as soon as she jumped he could see ""straight away"" the reserve parachute was not working properly. ""The reserve parachute was spiralling with only one side attached and the person underneath the parachute was being violently thrown around,"" he said. He added that Mrs Cilliers was ""very experienced, more experienced than myself in the qualifications she's got"". Fellow APA parachutist Brian Gardner said he saw Mrs Cilliers falling to the ground as the reserve parachute failed. He said: ""I landed normally and then I kind of heard a scream, I looked up, that's when I saw a parachute. It took me a while to see that it was a reserve that was malfunctioning. ""The parachutist started spiralling faster and faster, she started off going slowly and getting faster. She went down behind the hangars and trees."" The trial continues."

But while the Moray MP is running the line at the Camp Nou stadium in Spain, his fellow politicians will be debating the Government's flagship welfare reforms. The European game between the Spanish giants and Greek champions will kick-off at 7.45pm UK time, likely to be within an hour of a potential House of Commons vote on the roll-out of Universal Credit. A Labour motion calling on the full implementation of Universal Credit to be paused, due to worries over the execution of changes to the benefits system, will be debated during an opposition day debate on Wednesday afternoon. Opposition parties will look to force a vote on the motion, amid suggestions of a rebellion from Conservative MPs also concerned by the roll-out. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister met Tory MPs threatening to vote against the Government in a bid to avert a public showdown. But the apparent decision by Conservative whips to allow Mr Ross's absence suggests they are relaxed about the Labour motion, or could order their MPs to abstain in order to avoid a potential revolt. Labour's shadow Scotland minister Paul Sweeney attacked Mr Ross's ""perverse sense of priorities"". ""The rollout of Universal Credit has blighted lives across the country, forcing many to rely on food banks and crisis grants to get by,"" he said. ""Yet Mr Ross doesn't even have the decency to turn up to Parliament and explain why he supports putting people through such misery."" But the 34-year-old, who was elected to Parliament at June's General Election, was defended by his own party. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""There will be many Scottish Conservative representatives in this debate. ""Douglas has held more than 50 surgeries since becoming an MP and has met personally with Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke to discuss local cases which have arisen from those. ""The people of Moray are right behind Douglas and his refereeing, as they showed decisively when they elected him as their MP just a few months ago."" Mr Douglas also regularly officiates at Scottish football matches, according to MPs' register of interests. In September, the former member of the Scottish Parliament earned £1,436.35 from UEFA for serving as an assistant referee at the Europa League match between Slovenian side NK Domzale and French outfit Olympique de Marseille."

""This has been a difficult decision and we appreciate that this will be a tough time for those colleagues affected by the changes. We will support them in any way we can."" The company, which currently employs just under 200,000 people across its businesses, confirmed the cost-cutting plan after the markets had closed for the day. The shake-up by Sainsbury's, which took over Argos last year, is part of a previously announced £500m efficiency drive aimed at allowing the company to invest more in its customer proposition. The so-called big four chains, which also include Tesco, Asda and Morrisons, have been battling a customer drift towards discounters since the end of the financial crisis. The most recent industry data, published by Kantar Worldpanel, showed Sainsbury's market share had fallen to 15.8% in the 12 weeks to 8 October from 16% a year ago. The value of sales for the sector was 3.1% up, with Sainsbury's showing growth of 1.9%. The report painted a fairly rosy picture for the industry as spending on essentials shows little sign of winding down. Wider retail sales have come under pressure from the Brexit-linked squeeze on household budgets as inflation outpaces wage growth."
2017-10-17,"After 33 years of reconstructions and police appeals, the BBC has announced that Crimewatch is being axed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/bbc-axes-crimewatch-after-33-year-run-11084764,"The long-running show was only relaunched last September with Jeremy Vine at the helm, but it has struggled to attract primetime viewers. It will live on through its daytime spin-off Crimewatch Roadshow, with the BBC planning to produce two series per year. A spokesman said: ""We are incredibly proud of Crimewatch and the great work it has done over the years and the work Crimewatch Roadshow will continue to do."" Sue Cook and Nick Ross hosted the first show in 1984, and other presenters included Jill Dando, Fiona Bruce and Kirsty Young. When Dando was murdered outside her London home in 1999, an appeal was featured on the programme a month later. Other high-profile crimes to have featured on Crimewatch include the murders of James Bulger, Rhys Jones, Damilola Taylor and Sarah Payne - as well as the disappearances of Madeleine McCann and Claudia Lawrence. The Police Federation has described the show's cancellation as a ""shame"" because it allowed police forces to gain national coverage and wide reach for their appeals. Simon Kempton, the federation's head of operational policing, said: ""Crimewatch helped to raise the profile of thousands of incidents over the years, as well as show the public the complex side of policing. ""But if there aren't the audience figures and people aren't watching it, then you have to move with the times."" Former counter-terror detective David Videcette tweeted: ""The internet is a much better medium for crime solving than television. The times have changed, and Crimewatch doesn't cut it with viewers anymore."" Nick Ross, the show's presenter for its first 23 years, said he would remember the programme for the bravery of the victims and their relatives. He said: ""It's a shame it's going, but it was inevitable. With declining audiences the chances of making breakthroughs were getting smaller and smaller. ""It's the end of a remarkable piece of television history. For me the most searing memories are of meeting victims, some of them survivors of truly terrible experiences. ""We sometimes needed them to watch our reconstructions before the final edit, just to make sure everything was accurate, but also so we could cut out anything they found distressing. I think we in the production team were often much less stoical than they were."" Ross said he hoped the spirit of the programme would live on, not just in its spin-off, but through the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science at University College London - now the world's largest university department dedicated to preventing crime - which was created by some of those involved in the show in her memory."
2017-10-17,The number of hate crimes in England and Wales has risen by 29% to its highest level since the Home Office began categorising hate-related offences.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/hate-crime-offences-jump-29-year-on-year-11084817,"In 2016/17, police recorded 80,393 offences where hate was deemed to be a motivating factor, compared with 62,518 the previous year. Racially motivated crimes accounted for the largest number of offences - 62,685 - up 27% on 2015/16. Disability-related crime showed the highest percentage rise of all the hate crime categories - up 53% to 5,558 recorded offences. Hate crimes are categorised as offences motivated by someone's hostility or prejudice towards an individual's personal characteristics. The offences are broken down into five categories: race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender. All five categories have shown significant increases in the latest Home Office figures. Reported hate crimes based on sexual orientation rose 27% to 9,157 recorded offences, while religiously motivated offences saw an increase of 35% to 5,157. There was a 45% increase in reports of transgender-related hate crimes, although the number of reported transgender offences was the lowest of all the categories at 1,248 crimes. Some of the increases can be attributed to spikes in hate crime around the EU referendum last year and the Westminster Bridge terror attack in March this year. But the increase is also down to a greater willingness on the part of alleged victims to come forward and report offences, as well as significant improvements in the way police record hate crimes. Reacting to the increase, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""There is absolutely no place for hate crime in our society and this Government is taking action to tackle it. ""I am heartened that more victims are more confident to come forward and report incidents of hate crime, and that police identification and recording of all crime is improving. ""But no one in Britain should have to suffer violent prejudice, and indications that there was a genuine rise in the number of offences immediately following each of this year's terror attacks is undoubtedly concerning."" The report noted four spikes in racially or religiously aggravated offences - in June 2016 and March, May and June of this year. One of the spikes coincided with the UK voting to leave the EU, with reported hate crime offences up 44% in July 2016 compared with the same month the year before. By August last year, the number of hate crimes reported had reduced significantly, but was still higher than in August 2015. The other spikes in hate crime coincided with the Westminster Bridge attack, the Manchester Arena bombing and the attack at Borough Market. The new figures come after it was revealed fewer alleged hate criminals were prosecuted last year. In 2016/17, a total of 14,480 hate crime prosecutions were completed across England and Wales, down 6.2% from the previous year. The Home Office said it was working to crack down on those who commit hate crimes, with extra help for some communities, including a commitment to provide an additional £2.4m to protect places of worship. And it pointed to a £1m fund for vulnerable faith institutions and £900,000 to support community projects. Although hate crimes have shown a significant rise over the past year, they still account for a very small proportion of overall offences - less than 2% of all reported crime in England and Wales."

The US President phoned Sgt Johnson's pregnant widow Myeshia Johnson and spoke to her for about five minutes, according to ABC affiliate WPLG Local 10 in Miami. The conversation happened shortly before Mrs Johnson and the couple's two children - a two-year-old son and six-year-old daughter - arrived at the airport to meet her husband's coffin. With her was Frederica Wilson, a Democrat congresswoman for Florida. Ms Wilson told WPLG that Mr Trump had said: ""(Sgt Johnson) knew what he signed up for...but when it happens it hurts anyway."" She later tweeted: ""Sgt La David Johnson is a hero. ""(Donald Trump) does not possess the character, empathy or grace to be president of the United States."" A former Walmart employee, Sgt Johnson enlisted in January 2014 and defied the odds to become a decorated member of the prestigious 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. But the 25-year-old was killed on 4 October after his group was ambushed by more than 50 Islamist militants. He was initially left behind during the evacuation and his body was retrieved nearly two days later. Mr Trump was playing golf as Sgt Johnson's body arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on 7 October. Mr Trump's phone conversation with Mrs Johnson comes just days after he was criticised for saying previous presidents had not called families of fallen services personnel. He told NBC: ""President Obama I think probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn't. ""I don't know, that's what I was told. ""All I can do, all I can do is ask my generals. ""Other presidents did not call. They'd write letters. And some presidents didn't do anything. ""But I like the combination of, I like, when I can, the combination of a call and also a letter."" The comments drew sharp rebukes, with some of Mr Obama's former White House aides expressing outrage at the claim. Some critics say Mr Trump made them to distract attention from what happened to the four soldiers in Niger, which has not yet been fully explained. The others killed in the Niger attack were Staff Sgt Bryan C. Black, 35, of Washington; Staff Sgt Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Ohio, and Staff Sgt Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Georgia. The White House said Mr Trump had called all four families involved and ""offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their families' extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten""."
2017-10-17,The magic number is 301.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/how-would-boundary-changes-affect-political-parties-11084635,"That's the number of parliamentary seats required to secure an overall majority at the next general election if the recommendations of the independent Boundary Commissions are accepted. As part of their brief, the commissioners were instructed to reduce the House of Commons by 50 seats from the current 650. They were also told to remove inequalities in electorate size across constituencies. Three of those commissions, those for England, Scotland and Wales, have now published their revised proposals. The revised recommendations for Northern Ireland are still awaited. A further period of consultation is scheduled but radical changes are not expected. The results of the commissioners' deliberations are certain to create controversy and conflict in Westminster and beyond. This is because if the new boundaries had been in place last June, estimates show the Conservatives would have ""won"" a total of 308 seats - a Commons majority of 16 seats. If the nine seats that Sinn Fein are projected to win on the revised boundaries are also taken into account, then Theresa May would have had a working majority of 25. My colleague Colin Rallings and I were commissioned by a consortium comprising Sky News, BBC News, ITV News and the Press Association to estimate how votes would have been cast in the new constituencies at the last general election in June 2017. These estimates will now become the baseline to compare the parties' performance at the next election scheduled for 2022. Because the total number of seats is reduced, most parties lose out. But some lose out more than others. Overall the Conservatives are set to lose 10 seats but Labour's losses are projected to be three times that number, taking it to about 232 seats. Compared with the actual seats won in 2017 that's a three-point fall for the Tories but one of 11 points for Labour. The news is even worse for the Liberal Democrats. The estimates show the party with only seven seats instead of their current 12. Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru lose two seats but for the latter that halves their representation at Westminster. Labour will cry foul. It loses six seats in Wales, largely because the principality falls from 40 to just 29 seats. It loses another six seats in the North West England and there are losses too in the Midlands and London. Labour argues that the new method of electoral registration has led to it being disadvantaged by the boundary changes. The real number of eligible voters has been under-estimated, particularly in areas that typically support Labour. Other parties will join the protest. The Conservatives, of course, will be determined to see the proposals implemented but this requires parliamentary approval. The DUP's support is essential. But there's the rub: the initial recommendations from the Northern Ireland Commission indicate a net loss of three seats for the party. Under these circumstances it will be reluctant to support the Conservatives and the boundary changes will be rejected. Is this yet another heavy price the Conservatives will be forced to pay for Mrs May's failure to secure an outright win last June?"
2017-10-17,"A mental health crisis caused by super-strength cannabis is being exacerbated by Government policy putting criminalisation ahead of young people's wellbeing, a new report claims.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/super-strong-cannabis-prompts-calls-by-volteface-think-tank-to-legalise-drug-11086186,"The study, by drugs think tank Volteface and researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University and King's College London, found that high-potency cannabis has become almost ubiquitous on the streets. At the same time mental health referrals linked to the drug have soared, and police prosecutions for possession have halved in the last 10 years. The authors say the combination is putting young people's mental health at risk, and they call for the creation of a tightly controlled legal market in cannabis that would enable the harmful effects of new strains to be managed. Steve Moore of Volteface told Sky News leaving cannabis to the illicit market had incentivised growers and dealers to develop more potent strains. ""In a regulated market we could provide a range of options, and we could give really clear harm reduction messages,"" he said. ""A really good example is how we have alcohol regulation at the moment. ""You have 5%, 13%, 40% alcohol, but you get the choice and the knowledge and the information. ""With cannabis that doesn't exist at all. ""And because we can't enforce it, we can't control it, and the police haven't got the resources we need to look for other models to make it work."" Cannabis potency is determined by the relative quantities of two chemicals: the psychoactive agent THC, which causes the cannabis high and is associated with addiction and side effects, and CBD, a protective agent that mitigates against its effects. In more than 50 samples bought in Manchester and tested by researchers, every one had high levels of THC, around 15-20%, and negligible CBD content, meeting the definition of high-potency street cannabis. Teenagers told researchers it was easier to obtain than alcohol and cigarettes, while frontline mental health services reported a dramatic increase in referrals from cannabis users. Mental health problems associated with the drug occur on a spectrum, with anxiety at the lower end and extreme and paranoia drug-induced psychosis, which can be irreversible, at the other. Jodie Beckett, a former nurse who now works with recovering addicts and other vulnerable people in Wolverhampton, told Sky News cannabis addiction had a major impact on her life. ""At the beginning it was all a bit of fun, but once it becomes a daily habit and you're looking for it to feel normal it becomes a problem with relationships. ""You take it to feel normal but it makes you abnormal."" She was eventually struck off as a nurse. ""It came to a point where I was actually diagnosed with a drug-induced, mental health problem which I still have to take medication for today and I probably will for the rest of my life. ""Looking back at it, if I knew anyone tempted to or being offered it, I'd say 'no don't touch it', because it's the gateway to hell."" Professor Robin Murray of the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said: ""I have no doubt that people presenting for cannabis-induced psychosis are the 'tip of the iceberg' of people adversely affected by heavy cannabis use."" The police defended their enforcement policy. National Police Chiefs' Council lead for cannabis, Commander Simon Bray said: ""Police forces are committed to reducing the harms caused by drugs and we would remind people that these substances are controlled because they have been shown to be harmful. ""It is often not possible to know how dangerous a drug will be, or even what it contains - but all drugs can cause significant harm. ""We will continue to work closely with partner agencies and will use our enforcement powers appropriately and robustly, to deal with the impacts of illicit drug crime."""
2017-10-17,Shares in regional carrier Flybe have plunged by 20% after a profit warning saw it become the latest airline to hit turbulence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/flybe-shares-plunge-on-half-year-profit-warning-11086329,"Flybe said it had incurred higher than expected costs in the first half of its financial year after a review of aircraft maintenance. It said this reflected a drive to improve the reliability of its aircraft, particularly the Bombardier Q400 turboprop. The company, Europe's largest regional airline, now expects adjusted profit before tax for the period to be in the range of £5m to £10m, against market expectations of £15m. It compares with a profit of £15.9m in the same period last year. The fall also includes a previously disclosed £6m in IT costs related to the development of a new digital platform. Shares opened nearly a fifth lower before recovering some of that ground but were just over 20% down by the close of trading. Chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener, who took over the running of the airline in January, said: ""While half year profits are lower than expected, I am confident that we are still on a clear sustainable path to profitability. ""Our sustainable business improvement plan is delivering benefits with the fleet size now reducing and consequently both yield and load factors are increasing."" Interim results will be published on 9 November. Earlier this year, the Exeter-based company set out plans to slow expansion as it contends with increasing competition and slowing growth in consumer demand. It reported a pre-tax loss of £19.9m for the year to 31 March, down from a £2.7m profit the year before. Airlines across Europe are facing tough conditions in what is seen as over-capacity in the market. The UK's fifth biggest airline, Monarch, went into administration earlier this month, while elsewhere Alitalia and Air Berlin have gone under."
2017-10-17,"I set up the support page Sling the Mesh on Facebook two years ago, in June 2015, just 10 weeks after I had a mesh implant to treat incontinence from childbirth.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/journalist-kath-sansom-was-wreck-after-vaginal-mesh-implant-11086123,"The pain in my legs and feet was so intense, along with burning pains in my vagina - like being cut with a cheese wire - that I knew something was terribly wrong. When I told my surgeon of the pain I was suffering I was ignored. He told me I must have a slipped disc. I had walked into the operating theatre as one of the fittest mothers in her 40s you could wish to meet - a keen high board diver, mountain biker and boxer - and emerged a physical wreck. When I searched online I discovered women worldwide suffering similar problems. All were being ignored, not only by their surgeons but also by the media. It probably needed a journalist to be mesh injured to provide the final media push needed for the issue to get to Westminster. That journalist just happened to be me - a mum-of-two living in a small Fenland town more used to writing stories about animal rescues or council planning agendas than being suddenly caught up in what some medical professionals describe as the biggest health scandal of our time. :: Mesh implant problem 'bigger than Thalidomide' The mesh fight began in Britain in 2007 with TVT Mum, Meshies United, TVT Info, Welsh Mesh Survivors and Scottish Mesh Survivors - the latter achieving so much with a suspension of the plastic pelvic implants in Scottish Parliament in 2014 and a subsequent independent inquiry into its safety. Many other groups globally have fought for years too, all with one common goal - to stop others suffering as we have done. Over and again we have told our stories. That is what we were prepared to do, as it was the only way to make people sit up and take notice, to realise the scale of personal tragedy that mesh can cause when it goes wrong. Harry Evans, editor of the Sunday Times when the Thalidomide scandal broke in the 60s and 70s, said you must tell a story over and over until people get it. He ran Thalidomide articles every week for months until finally everybody realised what a huge scandal it was. And so it is with mesh. Globally, men and women injured by both pelvic and hernia mesh implants have told their stories. And finally people get it. Now the women and men in Sling the Mesh have helped trigger a debate in Parliament and we are calling for mesh procedures to be stopped immediately. When undergoing this surgery it is Russian roulette as to whether it will be successful or not. We hope that the British government will agree this is a risk not worth taking with a woman's health."
2017-10-17,"The UK is facing a ""multidimensional threat"" that is rapidly evolving ""at a scale and pace we've not seen before"", the director general of MI5 has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-terror-threat-evolving-at-unprecedented-level-mi5s-andrew-parker-says-11085432,"Andrew Parker said the security service is operating at an unprecedented level and has seen ""a dramatic upshift in threats this year"". ""It's at the highest tempo I've seen in my 34-year career,"" he said. ""Today there is more terrorist activity, coming at us more quickly, and it can be harder to detect. ""We're now running well over 500 live operations involving around 3,000 individuals known to be currently involved in extremist activity in some way. ""As well as those we are looking at today, risk can also come from returnees from Syria and Iraq and also the growing pool of over 20,000 individuals we've looked at in the past in our terrorism investigations. ""And there will be some violent extremists not yet known to us at all."" Speaking in central London during a rare public appearance, Mr Parker paid tribute to MI5's 4,000 intelligence officers and the agents who risk their lives operating undercover to protect the country. ""They get up and come to work every single day to make terrorist attacks less likely and to keep the country safe,"" he said. ""They're constantly making tough professional judgements based on fragments of intelligence, pinpricks of light against a dark and shifting canvas. ""That is the job of MI5. When an attack happens, everyone in MI5 is deeply affected, on a personal and professional level."" Separately, Mr Parker sat down for television interviews with the UK's three major broadcasters - the first time any serving British intelligence chief has done so. He told Sky News that tech companies have an ""ethical responsibility"" to help counter terrorism, adding that he wanted to create partnerships with them. ""All those (technological) developments that we have give opportunities at the edges to terrorists as well,"" he said. ""I don't believe that any of these companies want those unintended side effects. They don't want to be helping terrorists acquire the materials that they need for online purchasing. ""They don't want to be helping them in encrypted communication avoid detection by MI5 and they don't want to have their social media platforms used for terrorist propaganda."" Mr Parker added that ""some helpful action is being taken"", but said there is ""a challenge of pace, volume and reach as these technologies continue to develop so rapidly."" For the first time, the MI5 director general also revealed the existence of a European joint operational centre. The facility is based in the Netherlands and brings together intelligence officers from Europe's major agencies. Mr Parker said the operational centre had prevented attacks and captured more than a dozen terrorists ""who might not otherwise have been found in time"". He added: ""We don't just stand with our European colleagues, we work with them. We share intelligence. We run joint operations every single day. ""Only last week I met again with my counterparts from 30 European security services, known together as the Counter Terrorism Group or CTG, as we decided on the next stages of collective action."" The joint intelligence centre operates separately to the EU, but the fact that Mr Parker dedicated a significant chunk of his speech to address European co-operation was no accident. Brexit creates uncertainty for the intelligence agencies, as it does many British organisations. Mr Parker was honest, he said the threat to the UK is evolving at a scale and pace not seen before. It is a huge challenge to MI5 - a generational threat and there is no end in sight."
2017-10-17,Theresa May could have retained her House of Commons majority if June's snap General Election had been fought on a proposed shake-up of MPs' constituencies.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-would-have-kept-tory-majority-under-boundaries-plan-11084575,"An analysis of plans to cut the number of parliamentary seats, from 650 to 600, reveals if the vote had been held on a new list of constituencies the Conservatives may well have won an overall majority - rather than have to rely on the DUP's support to rule as a minority administration. The research, carried out for Sky News, the BBC, ITV News and the Press Association, suggests the Tories would have enjoyed a majority of 16; or effectively 25 if Sinn Fein were assumed not to take up their seats. Conducted by Professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, emeritus professors of politics at the University of Plymouth and associate members of Nuffield College, Oxford, the work will pressure the Prime Minister to push for boundary changes before the next General Election. However, the seats shake-up - the latest version of which has been proposed by boundary commissions in England, Wales and Scotland - is unlikely to get through Parliament due to Mrs May's lack of majority and fierce resistance from Opposition parties. :: North London battle for Labour MPs Labour signalled their rejection of the latest proposals to alter the UK's constituencies, as it was revealed Jeremy Corbyn could face a battle with some of his closest left-wing allies to stay in Parliament. The Labour leader's constituency is set to be axed under the plans, potentially plunging him into a fight with parliamentary neighbours Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, and Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary. Mr Corbyn, who has represented Islington North for 34 years, and his shadow cabinet allies are under threat because of a major shake-up of seats in north London. The Labour leader bitterly attacked the proposal to scrap his own seat when it was first announced last year, claiming it was based on an out-of-date version of the electoral register. At the moment, Ms Thornberry is MP for Islington South and Finsbury and Ms Abbott is MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington. The new plans propose a single Islington seat and a new Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington constituency. Meg Hillier, MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, could also be drawn into the battle. So too could David Lammy, the high-profile MP for Tottenham, and Kate Osamor, the Corbyn-backing shadow international development secretary and Edmonton MP. The plans could even possibly have an impact on Sir Keir Starmer, MP for Holborn and St Pancras and the shadow Brexit secretary, who is tipped by some Labour MPs as a potential party leader. :: Top Tories could go head-to-head The revised constituency list by the Boundary Commission for England also spells trouble for Boris Johnson, whose Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency faces the threat of abolition. For the Foreign Secretary, unless the proposals to axe his seat are overturned, his best hope is to switch to a new constituency of Hillingdon and Uxbridge, which includes large parts of his old seat. Tory MPs could also be forced to go head-to-head in Essex, where the county faces losing one MP. International Development Secretary Priti Patel and rising star James Cleverly may have to fight for the same seat. :: SNP and DUP badly hit The SNP, many of whose MPs have tiny majorities after June's election, are badly hit by plans by the Boundary Commission for Scotland to redraw the political map north of the border. The seat of the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, the Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency formerly represented by the late Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, is axed as Highland constituencies are cut from three to two. Also due to disappear is the SNP's former deputy leader Stewart Hosie's Dundee East seat, largely absorbed into a proposed Angus South and Dundee East constituency. Wales is set to lose 11 of its 40 seats and the Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, whose majority in Vale of Glamorgan in June was only a little over 2,000, is likely to be in difficulty. In Northern Ireland, the proposals are bad news for the Unionist parties - meaning they will be bitterly opposed by the Tories' Commons allies the DUP - and good news for Sinn Fein. Cutting the number of MPs to 600 was originally proposed by David Cameron when he was Opposition leader at the height of the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009. It was dropped after opposition from Mr Cameron's partners in the Coalition Government, the Liberal Democrats, and some Tory MPs. But it was in the Conservative manifesto in both 2015 and this year. There will now be an eight-week consultation on the shake-up, lasting until 11 December, which is likely to see political parties and individual MPs raising strong objections to many of the proposed changes. But, backing the shake-up, the Government's Constitution minister Chris Skidmore said: ""A boundary review is needed to ensure fair and equal representation for the voting public across the UK by the next general election. ""Without any boundary reforms, constituencies would be based on data that is over 20 years old. ""This would disregard significant changes in demographics, house building and migration."" Cat Smith MP, Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, said: ""Labour stands ready to work with all parties to ensure that a boundary review can go ahead in a way that benefits our democracy, not just the Conservative Party. ""However it has been clear from the start that the Tories have only been interested in their own political advantage rather than what is in the best interests of the country.""And the Liberal Democrat chief whip Alistair Carmichael called on the Government to stop wasting money on a ""dead-duck"" boundary review and scrap it.""The DUP will not wear this review,"" said Mr Carmichael. ""Nor will many Tory backbenchers. The Government should stop wasting public funds and bow to the inevitable."""
2017-10-17,Theresa May has met with Conservative MPs threatening to rebel over the Government's flagship welfare reforms in a bid to avert a public showdown in the House of Commons.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-meets-tory-universal-credit-rebels-to-avoid-vote-loss-11085360,"The Prime Minister met with Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston and Johnny Mercer on Tuesday afternoon to listen to their concerns over the roll-out of Universal Credit, which was meant to simplify and streamline the benefits system but has been beset with problems. The meeting comes ahead of two events that will put the troubled roll-out into the spotlight on Wednesday. Labour is trying to stoke Tory division with an opposition day debate on Universal Credit, while Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke is due to give evidence to a select committee inquiry. Downing Street refused to comment on Tuesday's meeting. But the audience with leading rebels on the eve of the opposition day debate has stoked speculation the Prime Minister might use Wednesday's session of Prime Minister's Questions or the later Universal Credit debate to announce concessions. Damian Hinds, the employment minister, also dealt with MPs' questions at a ""very well attended"" meeting on Tuesday evening. One MP who attended said the ""mood was positive"" as MPs asked a number of technical questions about the roll-out of the scheme. Rebel MPs are not opposed to the principle of reforming the welfare system but are worried about its roll-out: claimants are having to wait up to six weeks for their benefits, leaving many unable to buy food and pushed into debt and rent arrears. The dissatisfied MPs have presented ministers with a list of demands to improve the scheme. Suggestions include scrapping any wait period and giving claimants money immediately; stopping phone-line charges - it costs 55p a minute to call the helpline; and changing the system so that money is paid out fortnightly rather than monthly to help claimants budget. Ms Allen, the Tory MP for Cambridgeshire South, claims she has 25 Conservatives prepared to rebel on the matter. One would-be rebel told Sky News on Tuesday they expect the number to rise as the roll-out extends across the country and other MPs' postbags fill up with complaints from constituents. The programme combines six means-tested benefits into a single payment and is designed to help more people back into work. The system pays benefits in arrears to mirror the way wages are paid. But it is not just Conservative MPs giving the Government a headache over Universal Credit; the work and pensions committee inquiry was launched last month in response to the concerns over the roll-out. Frank Field, the committee's Labour chair, has accused ministers of withholding bad news over the progress of the welfare scheme. And he complains that the Department for Work and Pensions has so far refused to answer four formal letters requesting statistics and clarifications of the policy in recent weeks. The Prime Minister and Mr Gauke have sought to assuage MPs' concerns over the roll-out but have also signalled they will not apply the brakes as its implementation accelerates to 50 new job centres a month. Ms May said at party conference earlier this month that the move to Universal Credit was ""an important change to the benefits system"". ""I think it's important that we do roll it out,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Gauke, who has met with MPs in recent weeks to listen to their concerns, has insisted he is not taking a ""reckless or risky approach"" to the roll-out of the scheme. ""If I looked at it and thought this was a mistake I would be agitating to do something to stop it,"" he said, adding: ""But I don't."""
2017-10-17,Airbus is to take a majority stake in Bombardier's C-series passenger jet programme in a deal that could offer hope to thousands of UK workers as it faces a costly US trade dispute.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/airbus-to-partner-with-canadas-bombardier-11084622,"The European plane maker will acquire a 50.01% stake in the venture and will pay nothing for the holding - but it is expected that the arrangement will lead to savings on production and also make use of Airbus's international reach to boost sales. It could also help the jet programme overcome a US ruling that it must be subject to heavy import tariffs - after Airbus boss Tom Enders said it had offered to assemble some of the planes at its plant in Alabama for orders by American carriers. The move was hailed as a ""positive step forward"" by Business Secretary Greg Clark. Canadian firm Bombardier employs 4,000 people in Belfast where the wings for the C-Series are made. There have been fears for those jobs as the company is facing a 220% tariff on a new model of passenger jet and a second preliminary levy of 80% on the exports of its planes to the US. The dispute centres around claims from US firm Boeing that Bombardier received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada, allowing it to sell airliners at below-cost prices in the US. Davy Thompson, Unite regional coordinating officer, said the union had received assurances that the Airbus deal ""will mean that employment associated with the manufacture of C-Series wings will remain in Belfast"". He said it ""should safeguard the future of C-Series production jobs in Belfast for the foreseeable future"" - though there were ""continued challenges"" over jobs linked to other Bombardier contracts in Belfast. Under the deal - which is subject to approval by regulators - the remaining stakeholders would be Bombardier and Investissement Québec, which would own about 31% and 19% respectively. Airbus would provide procurement, sales and marketing, and customer support to the CSALP, the entity that makes and sells the jet. Airbus chief executive officer Tom Enders said: ""Not only will this partnership secure the C-Series and its industrial operations in Canada, the UK and China, but we also bring new jobs to the US. ""I have no doubt that our partnership with Bombardier will boost sales and the value of this programme tremendously."" Alain Bellemare, president and chief executive officer of Bombardier, said: ""This partnership should more than double the value of the C-Series programme and ensures our remarkable game-changing aircraft realises its full potential."" The C-Series headquarters will remain in Montreal but a second assembly line will be set up at Airbus's facility in Alabama. Mr Enders said that an aircraft made at a US Airbus facility would not be subject to duties under the US case, AP reported. A Boeing spokesman said: ""This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidised competitors to skirt the recent findings of the US government."" :: How the battle for our skies landed in Belfast It was not clear how the partnership between Bombardier and Airbus might affect the tariff row but Northern Ireland political leaders have welcomed the announcement. DUP leader Arlene Foster described it as ""incredibly significant news for Bombardier, Belfast and Northern Ireland"". East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson said: ""Over the last four months, our focus has been the Belfast workforce and securing a successful resolution to this ongoing dispute. ""Whilst there is some way to travel, we will offer our full support in securing the necessary regulatory approvals. The commitment to the Belfast facility is a testament to the ingenuity of the workforce. ""They should be proud that their valuable capability will continue to play a crucial role in C-Series."""

McGowan added that Amazon Studios ""called to say my show was dead"" after she asked it ""to do the right thing"" over a tie-up with The Weinstein Company. ""I am calling on you to stop funding rapists, alleged pedos and sexual harassers,"" she told Mr Bezos. ""I love Amazon but there is rot in Hollywood"". :: Weinstein accusers, critics and defenders The posts came hours after producer Isa Hackett claimed Roy Price inappropriately propositioned her in the back of taxi in 2015. Hackett, who worked on Amazon's The Man In The High Castle, said the alleged incident was ""shocking and surreal"". ""I want to call out (Price's) behaviour and also hold myself to a certain standard,"" she told The Hollywood Reporter. ""It's difficult because of the fact that I have two shows and I love those shows and I value my experience at Amazon. But this incident has been looming and it's difficult to shake it."" :: Why #MeToo is trending on social media After the allegations emerged, Price's fiance Lila Feinberg reportedly called off their wedding scheduled for 12 November. Meanwhile, Amazon suspended Price and said it would review its projects with The Weinstein Company. A day later, Amazon senior vice president Jeff Blackburn sent a memo to employees saying that the company did not tolerate harassment or abuse. He wrote: ""The news coming out of Hollywood over the past week has been shocking and disturbing - and unfortunately we are a part of it. It's sad and very disappointing to me."" On Tuesday, Harvey Weinstein resigned from the board of The Weinstein Company - the film studio he founded with his brother Bob in 2005. The 65-year-old reportedly owns an approximate 20% stake of the company, which is in talks with Colony Capital over a potential buyout. A series of women - including Gwyneth Paltrow, Cara Delevingne and Ashley Judd - have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment. Game of Thrones star Lena Headey claimed the Hollywood mogul made ""suggestive"" comments towards her and became enraged after she rejected his advances.

The latest survey by the Paris-based OECD projects economic growth of just 1% in next year. It sees the uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations as meaning that the UK is likely to be without a free-trade agreement with the EU by its official exit date in 2019. The economy could be further hit in the case of a ""disorderly Brexit"" - if talks between the EU and UK are cut short - the OECD warned. It said this would trigger a sharp financial market reaction, send the pound to new lows and lead to a downgrade in the UK's credit rating. ""Business investment would seize up, and heightened price pressures would choke off inflation,"" the OECD added. The risk that Scotland and Northern Ireland could vote to stay in the EU would also have a major impact on the national economy, it said. But the OECD said the risks could be avoided with a Brexit reversal. It said: ""In case Brexit gets reversed by political decision (change of majority, new referendum, etc), the positive impact on growth would be significant."" The report admitted that Brexit negotiations were hard to forecast and that they could prove ""more favourable"" than it had assumed. But this would require ""an ambitious EU-UK agreement and a transition period to allow for adjustment to the new agreement"". ""Meantime, however, uncertainty could hamper domestic and foreign investment more than projected and hurt consumption even more were the exchange rate to depreciate even further,"" the report said. OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria said: ""The United Kingdom is facing challenging times, with Brexit creating serious economic uncertainties that could stifle growth for years to come. ""Maintaining the closest economic relationship with the European Union will be absolutely key, for the trade of goods and services as well as the movement of labour."" Responding to the report, the UK Government said it was ""working to achieve the best deal with the EU that protects jobs and the economy"". ""We are leaving the EU and there will not be a second referendum."" Chancellor Philip Hammond said companies in Britain and the EU would benefit from the greater certainty provided by a time-limited Brexit transition period. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the OECD was ""fearful of what a Tory Brexit could mean for the UK economy""."

The UK-based FTSE 100 group, which also operates Alton Towers and Madame Tussauds, said its sites in the capital and European theme parks experienced ""difficult summer trading"" after a series of terror attacks and poor weather. Visitor numbers in London had been boosted early in the year thanks to the weak pound, but demand fell back following the Westminster Bridge attack and a series of other terrorist incidents - with Merlin warning the trend looked likely to continue. Chief executive Nick Varney said: ""Our markets continue to be impacted by certain external shocks, not least terrorism which is currently at record levels of intensity in Europe."" He also blamed employment legislation in the UK for contributing to ""significant cost pressures"". Mr Varney said the group had decided to ""adjust the tiller"" on its plans by reallocating spending from existing sites to its accommodation roll-out and productivity strategy. Merlin announced a deal with Peppa Pig maker Entertainment One to open themed attractions and accommodation in a number of countries. But it does not include the UK, where there is already a Peppa Pig World in Hampshire, while in China rights will be licensed to Merlin on a non-exclusive basis. Peppa Pig areas will open in existing theme parks in 2018 with the first standalone attraction expected in 2019. Merlin has also agreed a tie-up with survival expert Bear Grylls - with the first Bear Grylls Adventure site to open in Birmingham next year. The group set out its latest plans in a trading update for the 40 weeks to 7 October. Like-for-like sales crept up by 0.3% thanks to growth at its Legoland attractions while sales fell in other parts of the business. Merlin said trading in recent weeks had ""remained mixed"" and revenue for the full year was expected to remain flat compared to 2016. It offered a gloomy prognosis for next year, saying: ""Whilst it is too early to predict the outlook for 2018, it is likely that the recent trends experienced in London will persist for the foreseeable future."" Merlin still expects to see full-year earnings rise this year but Steve Clayton, manager of a Hargreaves Lansdown fund that holds Merlin stock, said the cut in spending on existing attractions was a concern. ""The worry is that the decision to reduce investment in standing assets risks hitting attendance levels in future years,"" Mr Clayton said."

District Judge George Conner ruled there was enough evidence for the pair to be tried at a crown court after considering arguments from the prosecution and defence. Olding, of Ardenlee Street, Belfast, and Jackson, of Oakleigh Park, Belfast, are accused of raping the woman at a property in south Belfast in June last year. Olding is charged with two counts of rape and Jackson is charged with one count of rape and another count of sexual assault. Both men deny the charges.

The first incident took place six months ago when his assistant received a written note on what appeared to be official Government paper purporting to be from Sir Michael, claiming that a British diplomat had been kidnapped. A conman, who ""sounded exactly like Sir Michael"" during a phone call, said UK laws prevented the Government paying a ransom and claimed he was now asking a syndicate of wealthy businesspeople to foot the bill. The scammers asked Sir Richard to cough up $5m (£3.7m). However, the cautious Virgin Group founder called Sir Michael's office. ""I rang Downing Street and asked to be put through to Sir Michael's office. His secretary assured me that Sir Michael hadn't spoken to me and that nobody had been kidnapped,"" he wrote. ""It was clearly a scam. I told them what had happened and we passed the matter over to the police.""

2017-10-17,"MPs will debate the risks associated with mesh implants after thousands of women say the device has perforated organs, caused chronic pain and left them unable to work or have sex.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/mesh-implant-problem-bigger-than-thalidomide-11086074,"The Labour Party has announced its backing a call for a public inquiry into the mesh procedures and called for products to be stopped immediately in England while this is ongoing. Around 15,000 women every year have a vaginal mesh procedure which is used to treat stress urinary incontinence and involves inserting a plastic tape through the vagina and around the urethra to support the bladder. The official complication rate for mesh procedures is 1-3% yet latest hospital figures obtained by Sky News show that it's higher, with almost 10% of women suffering adverse effects. Urogynaecologist Sohier Elneil says one of the key problems with mesh is that it can change once inside the body. It can become brittle, erode and slice through organs like the bladder. :: I was a 'physical wreck' after vaginal mesh implant ""It's a huge problem,"" Dr Elneil said. ""I think it's bigger than Thalidomide, because the numbers of those affected are much more. ""And if we look at the problem globally then it's worse than the metal-on-metal hips and the PIP scandal as well."" Dr Elneil is one of few surgeons trained to remove mesh implants, a highly dangerous operation as the implants are designed to be permanent. She says she used to see one or two women a month but now treats up to eight every week. She said: ""In England there's been this feeling that the number of women affected wasn't that great but not everyone was submitting their data, so there was very minimal information to make a decision on. ""Now with the latest reports, quite clearly this is a game changer and the procedure needs to be re-evaluated."" Kath Sansom had a mesh implant fitted to treat mild incontinence caused by childbirth. After suffering chronic pain, she started a campaign Sling the Mesh to provide support for others and call for the suspension of mesh implants to bring England in line with Scotland, where they were suspended in 2014. The campaign group now has more than 3,000 members. She said: ""The medical professionals are all very good at denying there's a problem or saying you are a mystery patient. ""There is also an element of misogyny whereby your pain is belittled because, to look at us women, none of us look ill or in pain. ""The damage is hidden. ""This makes it easier to be shuffled off into a corner and ignored."" As Sky News first reported two years ago, for many patients the procedure can be quick and successful but thousands have suffered debilitating conditions, are on daily medication and some now struggle to walk. But there's another issue Ms Sansom says is rarely discussed - the effect mesh has on a woman's sex life. For hundreds of women they say the pain they suffer makes having sexual intercourse impossible. She said: ""The impact on women is so devastating. ""It's such a personal thing and anyone in a healthy relationship will want an intimate relationship and when that is taken away it robs them of a massive part of being a couple and puts a huge strain on relationships and family life. ""It's so cruel."" NHS England and various clinical bodies, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, maintain that, for many patients, mesh is a safe and effective option that greatly helps with conditions which can be distressing for those affected. They support the view of the official regulator of mesh, the Medicines and Healthcare products and Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which says there's not enough evidence to justify a ban. The MHRA's director of devices John Wilkinson said: ""There is no regulatory reason to take the product off the market because if it is used in the right circumstances with the right patients appropriately consented and aware of the risks then we have no evidence that the product should be taken off the market."" Vaginal mesh implants are, however, the subject of huge litigation. Sky News has learnt that across the world more than 55,000 women are suing one manufacturer of mesh, Johnson and Johnson. In the UK, pressure is also mounting, with 400 women taking legal action against the pharmaceutical giant in what lawyers say could become the biggest medical case in UK history. In a statement, Ethicon, the sister company of Johnson and Johnson which makes mesh products in the UK, said: ""Ethicon is confident in the positive impact our pelvic mesh products have had on the vast majority of women who have chosen this treatment option. ""We are confident the evidence will show that Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the research, development and marketing of its pelvic mesh products."""

He makes an unlikely lightning rod for fury. Yet this week barely a day has passed without Hammond attracting the ire of his colleagues. He has become the de facto ringmaster of the Tory Remainers. He is privately and publicly scornful of his Brexiteer colleagues. He considers them to be out of touch with economic and commercial reality. He has become the go-to voice for the City and big business in the Cabinet, who argue for as little change as possible. Hence this week his reluctance to commit to spend Treasury money on tasking the civil service to prepare for a no-deal scenario with Brussels. He said it would be wrong to do so ""just to make some demonstration point"". This enraged the Brexiteers. They suspect foul play, that he's trying to frustrate Brexit. Consequently one of Hammond's predecessors, Nigel Lawson, told me on Thursday that he was ""damaging the country"" and that Theresa May should sack him. Many MPs agreed. And today, The Sunday Telegraph's front page told us that the DUP are similarly incensed. The paper says senior DUP parliamentary sources have said they are ""extremely concerned about Philip Hammond's behaviour"" and that he is ""trying to frustrate the Brexit process"". The article claims the DUP source has said Theresa May must sack him if he doesn't change his tune. Given Mrs May is Prime Minister only because of their 10 seats, this is no insignificant threat. But is it true? I have my doubts. For a start, although the DUP are arch-Brexiteers, they are most certainly not ""no-dealers"". They know more than anyone how damaging a hard border would be for Northern Ireland. That is what would return if Britain cannot reach an accommodation with the EU. Indeed, the DUP told Sky's David Blevins on Sunday morning that they do not recognise the comments attributed to them by the Telegraph. There is mischief afoot. And I wonder whether some of the more extreme stories being pumped into the press this week about Hammond might not have the fingerprints of team Boris Johnson. Let's not forget, only a week ago it was his future, not the Chancellor's, which was on everyone's lips. And maybe that's not surprising, for they have each, in their own way, come to epitomise one wing of their party: the hard Remainers and hard Leavers respectively. Consequently, each side is calling for the other's captain to get the sack. Precisely for this reason, I suspect in the end, May will choose not to move either. Reshuffling either a chancellor or foreign secretary is a big step even for a powerful PM. For a weak one, in a situation where both would probably choose to return to the backbenches rather than be moved, it could be lethal. Especially given the wider Brexit politics. :: UKIP leader - I could strangle a badger:: 'Brexit makes hard Irish border inevitable' Moving one but not the other would disrupt the extremely delicate equilibrium between the factions in the Tory Europe civil war. And moving both? Maybe even worse - it might actually be the one thing to bring them together. Much better to leave them and create space for new blood lower down the cabinet pecking order. After all, in some ways, who is the person who suffers most from a wounded chancellor and foreign secretary? A wounded prime minister, worried for her job."

Ministers will now be able to scrutinise takeover companies with a turnover of more than £1m, down from the current £70m threshold. And a merger will no longer need to increase a business's share of UK supply to 25% or over. Business secretary Greg Clark told Sky News the changes needed to reflect an economy where ""many smaller suppliers can have a big effect on our systems"". He said being able to block or put conditions on smaller infrastructure company mergers would stop them ""slipping through the net"". ""These are the powers that all of our principle allies and industrial competitors have - the US, France, Germany, Australia - this is pretty standard,"" he said. ""It's not about blocking all overseas investment, quite the opposite. It's about making sure we have the confidence to attract investment knowing that we can make sure there is never any threat to national security."" Nigel Parr, a competition partner at law firm Ashurst, said it was a ""small step"" for the Government. He added: ""The proposals announced today are much more modest than some of the earlier indications suggested they would be, and sit within the existing mergers regime rather than within a newly created foreign investment body, such as Committee on Foreign Investment in the US."""
2017-10-17,"Inflation rose to 3% in September, its highest level in more than five years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171018082450/http://news.sky.com/story/inflation-climbs-to-3-in-september-ons-11084809,"The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation rose from 2.9% in August thanks partly to higher food prices - adding to the squeeze on households as pay growth lags behind. But the increase will be welcomed by those receiving the state pension, as the September figure is used to calculate increases in the benefit next April under the Government's ""triple lock"" guarantee. It is the first time CPI inflation has reached 3% since April 2012. The Bank of England targets inflation at 2%. The CPI figure - which was in line with expectations - should bolster expectations that the Bank will hike interest rates next month, though some have cautioned against such a move at a time of tepid economic growth. A slump in the pound since the Brexit vote last year, which makes imports more expensive, has contributed to rising inflation, though the ONS said increasing global commodity prices could also be a factor. Bank of England governor Mark Carney told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee that a rise in inflation to more than 3% had been anticipated. He said: ""We had signalled prior to the referendum that in the event of a vote to leave... we expected sterling to fall sharply - it did. That passes through to prices."" Despite the rise in inflation, the pound slipped by nearly a cent against the US dollar to less than $1.32 on Tuesday - after the Bank's new deputy governor Sir David Ramsden told the same committee that he was not close to voting for an interest rate hike. The latest ONS data showed food and non-alcoholic beverage prices were climbing at the highest rate since October 2013. Computer games, together with a change in the way the ONS accounts for air fares in inflation data, also contributed to the rise in inflation, as did an increase in fuel prices. Clothing costs, which rose by less than they did in the same period last year, had a downward effect. Inflation has been running well ahead of wage rises, which according to latest official data were just above 2%. The TUC called on the Government to ""face up to Britain's cost of living crisis"" and give five million public sector workers ""the pay rise they have earned"". The Treasury pointed to actions it has taken to help families, such as a freeze on fuel duty, increased free childcare and the national living wage. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and that households could be past the worst of the real wage squeeze with inflation likely to trend downwards over coming months, and wages likely to strengthen. For pensioners, the uptick in inflation helps, as the Government has committed to increasing the state pension by 2.5%, earnings growth, or CPI inflation in September; whichever is higher. But there was a blow for businesses as the separate Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation, which includes owner-occupier housing costs, was unchanged at 3.9% - its highest level since the start of 2012. The figure will be used to calculate next April's increase in business rates, prompting calls for a rates freeze and a warning from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) that many shops could be left ""struggling to survive""."

Flood warnings were in place on Scotland's west coast. Part of a derelict block of flats in Glasgow, already earmarked for partial demolition, collapsed at about 4am. In Dumfries and Galloway, a scout hall's roof was blown off as the area was subjected to winds of up to 77mph. Cumbria County Council said a roof had been torn from a house in Whitehaven, while traffic lights were ripped from their poles. At football club Barrow AFC, part of a stand roof was torn off. In Ireland, meanwhile, it could be eight days before some people get power switched back on, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said. Three people were killed when the strongest storm to hit the country in almost 60 years tore roofs off buildings, downed power lines, flooded coastal areas and felled trees on Monday. A major repair and clean-up operation is now under way. Mr Varadkar, who has visited engineers working in some of the worst-hit areas, said there were two incidents in which emergency workers almost died because power lines had come down. ""It is anticipated that the vast majority of people will have power restored in the next three to four days,"" he said. ""Some may be without power for eight days."" On Tuesday afternoon, around 170,000 customers were still without power. In Northern Ireland, electricity supplies were still disrupted to around 1,800 homes and businesses, To help assess the damage in the Republic, soldiers have been deployed, along with two military vehicles and two helicopters. Thousands of staff from the Electricity Supply Board are working to fix fallen and broken cables. They will be joined by crews from Northern Ireland, while others from Scotland and France are expected to be drafted in on Wednesday."
2017-10-18,The Government has refused to hold a public inquiry into the use of vaginal mesh implants which medical experts have described as a health scandal worse than Thalidomide.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/vaginal-mesh-public-inquiry-turned-down-by-government-11086074,"Labour MPs joined the calls of thousands of mesh-injured women to suspend mesh procedures, which are used to treat urinary incontinence and prolapse, and review the evidence on their safety. But Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said the priority is to look into the treatment of women and the recording of complications. She also announced that an update to national clinical guidelines by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on the use of vaginal mesh will be brought forward and be published by the end of the year, 18 months earlier than planned. Her decision was met with gasps from women listening to a debate in Parliament - and shock from fellow MPs. Labour MP Emma Hardy said the minister's ""reaction"" was ""simply not good enough"", adding that she and others would ""keep pushing"" until they got a ""much more satisfactory answer"". Thousands of women have said the implants have perforated organs, caused chronic pain and left them unable to work or have sex. Earlier, the Labour Party said it was backing a call for a public inquiry into the procedure, and called for products to be stopped immediately in England while it was ongoing. Around 15,000 women every year have the operation, which involves inserting a plastic tape through the vagina and around the urethra to support the bladder. The official complication rate for mesh procedures is 1-3%, yet latest hospital figures obtained by Sky News show that it is higher, with almost 10% of women suffering adverse effects. Urogynaecologist Sohier Elneil says one of the key problems with mesh is that it can change once inside the body. It can become brittle, erode and slice through organs like the bladder. :: I was a 'physical wreck' after vaginal mesh implant ""It's a huge problem,"" Dr Elneil said. ""I think it's bigger than Thalidomide, because the numbers of those affected are much more. ""And if we look at the problem globally then it's worse than the metal-on-metal hips and the PIP scandal as well."" Dr Elneil is one of few surgeons trained to remove mesh implants, a highly dangerous operation as the implants are designed to be permanent. She says she used to see one or two women a month but now treats up to eight every week. She said: ""In England there's been this feeling that the number of women affected wasn't that great but not everyone was submitting their data, so there was very minimal information to make a decision on. ""Now with the latest reports, quite clearly this is a game changer and the procedure needs to be re-evaluated."" Kath Sansom had a mesh implant fitted to treat mild incontinence caused by childbirth. After suffering chronic pain, she started a campaign Sling the Mesh to provide support for others and call for the suspension of mesh implants to bring England in line with Scotland, where they were suspended in 2014. The campaign group now has more than 3,000 members. She said: ""The medical professionals are all very good at denying there's a problem or saying you are a mystery patient. ""There is also an element of misogyny whereby your pain is belittled because, to look at us women, none of us look ill or in pain. ""The damage is hidden. ""This makes it easier to be shuffled off into a corner and ignored."" As Sky News first reported two years ago, for many patients the procedure can be quick and successful but thousands have suffered debilitating conditions, are on daily medication and some now struggle to walk. But there's another issue Ms Sansom says is rarely discussed - the effect mesh has on a woman's sex life. For hundreds of women they say the pain they suffer makes having sexual intercourse impossible. She said: ""The impact on women is so devastating. ""It's such a personal thing and anyone in a healthy relationship will want an intimate relationship and when that is taken away it robs them of a massive part of being a couple and puts a huge strain on relationships and family life. ""It's so cruel."" NHS England and various clinical bodies, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, maintain that, for many patients, mesh is a safe and effective option that greatly helps with conditions which can be distressing for those affected. They support the view of the official regulator of mesh, the Medicines and Healthcare products and Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which says there's not enough evidence to justify a ban. The MHRA's director of devices John Wilkinson said: ""There is no regulatory reason to take the product off the market because if it is used in the right circumstances with the right patients appropriately consented and aware of the risks then we have no evidence that the product should be taken off the market."" Vaginal mesh implants are, however, the subject of huge litigation. Sky News has learnt that across the world more than 55,000 women are suing one manufacturer of mesh, Johnson and Johnson. In the UK, pressure is also mounting, with 400 women taking legal action against the pharmaceutical giant in what lawyers say could become the biggest medical case in UK history. In a statement, Ethicon, the sister company of Johnson and Johnson which makes mesh products in the UK, said: ""Ethicon is confident in the positive impact our pelvic mesh products have had on the vast majority of women who have chosen this treatment option. ""We are confident the evidence will show that Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the research, development and marketing of its pelvic mesh products."""

Cameras hidden in the screen will detect people's faces, figuring out their age, gender and mood, and use that to tailor brand messages. According to Ocean Outlook, the company that provides the screen's technology, the system can detect people's age and gender with 90% accuracy. The system can identify the makes of vehicles and will also feature Wi-Fi to let people interact with the screen, but also potentially to track mobile devices. Privacy campaigners say signs should be put up in Piccadilly Circus to inform the public they are being monitored. Renate Samson, chief executive of Big Brother Watch, told Sky News: ""From a privacy and security point of view, we think (it) is incredibly intrusive. ""It literally is Minority Report."" Landsec, the company which owns the screen, refused repeated requests from Sky News for an interview.

Here are some not-so-fun facts about the impact of traffic on UK drivers: 170,000 traffic jams occurred in November last year - 50% above average. More than 14 miles of disruption occurred as a result of lane closures on the A406W North Circular Road near Wembley in London in the same month. £9bn worth of time, fuel and carbon emissions were wasted last year. A 15-hour jam on the M5 northbound near junction 20 near Clevedon was the worst queue of 2016, caused by an accident involving two lorries which created a fuel spill, leading to a 36-mile tailback. Why is November the worst? There are a number of factors. The weather gets colder, so fewer people get on their bikes and walk. Also, Christmas is approaching so people are out buying presents. Chief economist at Inrix, which analysed the data, says last November was also colder than usual. ""The risk of ice on the road can lead to slower moving traffic and people are more inclined to take shelter in vehicles over cycling or walking in cold snaps."""

The latest survey by the Paris-based OECD projects economic growth of just 1% in next year. :: Analysis: The boldest Brexit forecast since the EU vote It sees the uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations as meaning that the UK is likely to be without a free-trade agreement with the EU by its official exit date in 2019. The economy could be further hit in the case of a ""disorderly Brexit"" - if talks between the EU and UK are cut short - the OECD warned. It said this would trigger a sharp financial market reaction, send the pound to new lows and lead to a downgrade in the UK's credit rating. ""Business investment would seize up, and heightened price pressures would choke off inflation,"" the OECD added. The risk that Scotland and Northern Ireland could vote to stay in the EU would also have a major impact on the national economy, it said. But the OECD said the risks could be avoided with a Brexit reversal. It said: ""In case Brexit gets reversed by political decision (change of majority, new referendum, etc), the positive impact on growth would be significant."" The report admitted that Brexit negotiations were hard to forecast and that they could prove ""more favourable"" than it had assumed. But this would require ""an ambitious EU-UK agreement and a transition period to allow for adjustment to the new agreement"". ""Meantime, however, uncertainty could hamper domestic and foreign investment more than projected and hurt consumption even more were the exchange rate to depreciate even further,"" the report said. OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria said: ""The United Kingdom is facing challenging times, with Brexit creating serious economic uncertainties that could stifle growth for years to come. ""Maintaining the closest economic relationship with the European Union will be absolutely key, for the trade of goods and services as well as the movement of labour."" Responding to the report, the UK Government said it was ""working to achieve the best deal with the EU that protects jobs and the economy"". ""We are leaving the EU and there will not be a second referendum."" Chancellor Philip Hammond said companies in Britain and the EU would benefit from the greater certainty provided by a time-limited Brexit transition period. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the OECD was ""fearful of what a Tory Brexit could mean for the UK economy""."
2017-10-18,"A mental health crisis caused by super-strength cannabis is being exacerbated by Government policy putting criminalisation ahead of young people's wellbeing, a new report claims.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/super-strong-cannabis-prompts-calls-by-volteface-think-tank-to-legalise-drug-11086186,"The study, by drugs think tank Volteface and researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University and King's College London, found that high-potency cannabis has become almost ubiquitous on the streets. At the same time mental health referrals linked to the drug have soared, and police prosecutions for possession have halved in the last 10 years. The authors say the combination is putting young people's mental health at risk, and they call for the creation of a tightly controlled legal market in cannabis that would enable the harmful effects of new strains to be managed. Steve Moore of Volteface told Sky News leaving cannabis to the illicit market had incentivised growers and dealers to develop more potent strains. ""In a regulated market we could provide a range of options, and we could give really clear harm reduction messages,"" he said. ""A really good example is how we have alcohol regulation at the moment. ""You have 5%, 13%, 40% alcohol, but you get the choice and the knowledge and the information. ""With cannabis that doesn't exist at all. ""And because we can't enforce it, we can't control it, and the police haven't got the resources we need to look for other models to make it work."" Cannabis potency is determined by the relative quantities of two chemicals: the psychoactive agent THC, which causes the cannabis high and is associated with addiction and side effects, and CBD, a protective agent that mitigates against its effects. In more than 50 samples bought in Manchester and tested by researchers, every one had high levels of THC, around 15-20%, and negligible CBD content, meeting the definition of high-potency street cannabis. Teenagers told researchers it was easier to obtain than alcohol and cigarettes, while frontline mental health services reported a dramatic increase in referrals from cannabis users. Mental health problems associated with the drug occur on a spectrum, with anxiety at the lower end and extreme and paranoia drug-induced psychosis, which can be irreversible, at the other. Jodie Beckett, a former nurse who now works with recovering addicts and other vulnerable people in Wolverhampton, told Sky News cannabis addiction had a major impact on her life. ""At the beginning it was all a bit of fun, but once it becomes a daily habit and you're looking for it to feel normal it becomes a problem with relationships. ""You take it to feel normal but it makes you abnormal."" She was eventually struck off as a nurse. ""It came to a point where I was actually diagnosed with a drug-induced, mental health problem which I still have to take medication for today and I probably will for the rest of my life. ""Looking back at it, if I knew anyone tempted to or being offered it, I'd say 'no don't touch it', because it's the gateway to hell."" Professor Robin Murray of the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said: ""I have no doubt that people presenting for cannabis-induced psychosis are the 'tip of the iceberg' of people adversely affected by heavy cannabis use."" The police defended their enforcement policy. National Police Chiefs' Council lead for cannabis, Commander Simon Bray said: ""Police forces are committed to reducing the harms caused by drugs and we would remind people that these substances are controlled because they have been shown to be harmful. ""It is often not possible to know how dangerous a drug will be, or even what it contains - but all drugs can cause significant harm. ""We will continue to work closely with partner agencies and will use our enforcement powers appropriately and robustly, to deal with the impacts of illicit drug crime."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""This Government has no plans to legalise cannabis. There is clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health, and harms individuals and communities.""The decriminalisation of cannabis would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery this can cause to families and society.""It would send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs, especially young and vulnerable people, with the potential grave risk of increased misuse of drugs."""

The suspect was later linked to a shooting at a used car dealership around 55 miles away in Wilmington, Delaware. Police said at least one victim at the dealership was targeted and described the shooting as ""not a random act"". Suspect Radee Labeeb Prince, 37, has 42 previous arrests in Delaware and was fired from his job earlier this year after allegedly punching a colleague and threatening other workers. Advanced Granite Solutions owner Barak Caba said Mr Prince had worked there for four months as a machine operator.

Despite Tory MPs being expected to abstain on the eventual vote, impassioned opposition backbenchers fought to reveal their constituents' struggles. Labour's Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, tackled the Government over the expected impact on his local foodbank in Birkenhead. The Trussell Trust-run centre said it would need 15 tonnes of extra food donations when Universal Credit is implemented in Wirral just before Christmas. ""What message should I take home?"" Mr Field asked Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke. ""Should I go home and tell the good citizens of Birkenhead that the foodbank is scaremongering? That we should pay no attention to them? ""Or should they contribute that extra 15 tonnes to the foodbank to prevent people being hungry over Christmas as a result of the roll-out and his inability to deliver a scheme that works?"" Stephen Doughty, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, also said housing association tenants who were already on Universal Credit were up to £500 in rent arrears. He blamed long delays of up to three months for people waiting to receive their benefits. While the SNP firebrand Mhairi Black branded the Government a ""pious loan shark"". She said: ""Instead of coming through the front door, they're coming after your mental health, your physical wellbeing, your stability, your sense of security - that is what the experience is from all of our constituents… ""Halt it and halt it now."" Mr Gauke, who hours earlier announced call charges to the welfare helpline would be scrapped, defended the programme. He welcomed the debate and said only 10% of the households that will eventually move on to Universal Credit will be on it by January. He quoted one claimant, who got a job after being enrolled on the scheme, saying they did ""not think it would have been possible without Universal Credit"". Iain Duncan Smith, the man in charge of the DWP when Universal Credit was conceived in 2013, said its opponents were ""scaremongering"". ""It's not just about getting people back into work, it's about changing lives,"" he said. One Conservative MP, Sarah Wollaston, did break ranks to criticise the roll-out of Universal Credit: ""Many of the people I used to look after when I was in clinical practice and the people I represent now who come to my constituency surgeries have no cushion whatsoever. This is devastating for them. We can't ignore the compelling cases that we've heard. We can't allow that to continue."" MPs passed the opposition motion 299-0 but most Conservatives and the DUP abstained. The Speaker, John Bercow, appeared angry that the government had not respected Parliament and has called for a minister to appear before the ""House and show respect to the institution and say what it intends to do."""

When I told my surgeon of the pain I was suffering I was ignored. He told me I must have a slipped disc. I had walked into the operating theatre as one of the fittest mothers in her 40s you could wish to meet - a keen high board diver, mountain biker and boxer - and emerged a physical wreck. When I searched online I discovered women worldwide suffering similar problems. All were being ignored, not only by their surgeons but also by the media. It probably needed a journalist to be mesh injured to provide the final media push needed for the issue to get to Westminster. That journalist just happened to be me - a mum-of-two living in a small Fenland town more used to writing stories about animal rescues or council planning agendas than being suddenly caught up in what some medical professionals describe as the biggest health scandal of our time. :: Mesh implant problem 'bigger than Thalidomide' The mesh fight began in Britain in 2007 with TVT Mum, Meshies United, TVT Info, Welsh Mesh Survivors and Scottish Mesh Survivors - the latter achieving so much with a suspension of the plastic pelvic implants in Scottish Parliament in 2014 and a subsequent independent inquiry into its safety. Many other groups globally have fought for years too, all with one common goal - to stop others suffering as we have done. Over and again we have told our stories. That is what we were prepared to do, as it was the only way to make people sit up and take notice, to realise the scale of personal tragedy that mesh can cause when it goes wrong. Harry Evans, editor of the Sunday Times when the Thalidomide scandal broke in the 60s and 70s, said you must tell a story over and over until people get it. He ran Thalidomide articles every week for months until finally everybody realised what a huge scandal it was. And so it is with mesh. Globally, men and women injured by both pelvic and hernia mesh implants have told their stories. And finally people get it. Now the women and men in Sling the Mesh have helped trigger a debate in Parliament and we are calling for mesh procedures to be stopped immediately. When undergoing this surgery it is Russian roulette as to whether it will be successful or not. We hope that the British government will agree this is a risk not worth taking with a woman's health."

The violent and chaotic removal of a screaming Mr Dao from a United Airlines flight at Chicago Airport in April was filmed by several of his fellow passengers. The footage went viral on social media, causing a public relations disaster for the airline. As he was pulled from his seat, Dr Dao's head hit an armrest and as he was dragged down the aisle with his face streaming with blood from a broken nose, his glasses slipped off and his shirt rode up his chest. He was later filmed standing up, saying over and over ""just kill me"". After initially mishandling the aftermath of the affair, United Airlines apologised and settled with Mr Dao, who had threatened to sue them, for an undisclosed sum. He had been apparently randomly selected to be leave the Flight 3411 to Louisville because United needed the seat for a member of a different flight crew but Dr Dao refused, saying he had patient appointments to keep. A violent altercation followed as officers tried to remove him, leaving other fliers visibly and audibly shocked. Mr Dao's lawyer Thomas Demetrio said his client was ""neither vindictive nor happy,"" adding: ""There is a lesson to be learned here for police officers at all levels.

2017-10-18,"The launch site for several of North Korea's nuclear tests appears to be caving in - a condition known as ""Tired Mountain Syndrome"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-nuclear-test-site-may-be-suffering-from-tired-mountain-syndrome-11086429,"The geological condition occurs when underground nuclear blasts cause the surrounding rock to become weak and permeable. Five of Pyongyang's six nuclear tests have been carried out under Mount Mantap at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, in the country's north west. Since Pyongyang's most recent - and most powerful - nuclear test on 3 September, there have been three small earthquakes in the immediate area. The first happened shortly after the blast while two smaller tremors took place in late September and last week. :: N Korea missile test: What message is Kim Jong Un trying to send? The 38 North website, which reports on issues involving North Korea, said there could be concern about the phenomenon at Mount Mantap, as the area affected by the latest blast could potentially extend as far as 1.4km from the detonation point. But it says such results are ""not unusual"", and probably won't stop the area being used for further tests. ""There is no valid reason to assume that the Punggye-ri test site is unable to contain additional underground nuclear tests,"" the report said. Punggye-ri has two more unused tunnel complexes, it said. Kim Jong Un told party officials this month that the country's atomic weapons were a ""treasured sword"" to protect it from aggression. But nuclear missiles aren't the only thing North Korea is launching. Its deputy UN ambassador has said it plans to also launch more satellites. At a UN meeting called the International Co-operation in the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, Kim In Ryong said the country's five-year plan for 2016-20 includes the development of ""practical satellites that can contribute to the economic development and improvement of the people's living"". :: Sky Views: Sanctions won't stop Kim Jong Un He accused the US of trying to block its efforts on grounds it violates UN sanctions. ""The US is the country that launched the largest number of satellites and yet it claims that our launch of satellites is a threat to international peace and security,"" he said. Some, including in the US, fear North Korea's space programme is a cover for developing weapons."
2017-10-18,Is one of Britain's largest companies preparing to break itself in two?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/durex-splits-from-brasso-and-cillit-bang-in-group-shake-up-at-rb-11086813,"That is the conclusion from the news that consumer goods giant RB, formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, is reorganising itself into two divisions. One division, RB Health, takes in heathcare brands including Neurofen, Strepsils, Gaviscon, Clearasil and Dettol, as well as 'lifestyle' brands such as Durex, Scholl and Veet. The second, RB Hygiene Home, will own household products brands such as Air Wick, Finish, Calgon, Mr Sheen, Vanish, Brasso and Cillit Bang. This is a big shake-up for the UK's 13th-largest company, which was formed by the 1999 merger between British firm Reckitt & Colman with the Dutch company Benckiser. With a stock market value of just under £50bn, RB is a vast business that, during the last decade or so, has made a number of shrewd acquisitions of assets that it successfully identified as having good growth prospects - then managed them more aggressively than their existing owners. These included the old Boots Healthcare business in 2005, which brought in Strepsils and Neurofen; the 2008 acquisition of Adams Healthcare, which brought in Mucinex and the 2010 takeover of SSL, which added Scholl and Durex. The biggest roll of the dice came when, earlier this year, RB announced it was splashing out $16.7bn for the US baby milk maker Mead Johnson. Some businesses have been offloaded along the way, including the famous Colman's mustard brand, but most notably Indivior, a provider of opioids to people seeking to lose their heroin addiction, which was floated off in 2014. Following the Mead Johnson deal, RB also announced plans to sell its remaining food brands, including the French's mustard business. Announcing the move, RB said: ""The two business units will together form one RB - a single company devoted to delivering on our mission of creating healthier lives and happier homes."" Yet this separation of the two businesses will inevitably lead to speculation RB plans to float off its Hygiene Home arm which, accounting for 40% of sales, is the smaller of the two divisions. Adding fuel to this is that Rakesh Kapoor, RB's chief executive, will be personally heading RB Health. There is a logic to the reorganisation. Along with other consumer goods giants like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, RB is wrestling both with changing consumer habits and tastes, including disruption from internet start-ups that sell direct to the consumer and competition from supermarket own brands. All at a time when the rising price of commodities like palm oil, a key ingredient, are rising. A more formal break-up would undoubtedly be welcomed. Investors have started to fret that sales growth has stalled at RB - concerns accentuated today when RB admitted that, during the three months to the end of September, sales were down 1% on the same period on a like-for-like basis. Analysts had been expecting growth during the quarter. Adding to those worries have been a string of setbacks, including a cyberattack in June this year and an earlier scandal in South Korea involving the sale of a humidifier disinfectant linked to the deaths of more than 100 people. This has got some shareholders worrying that, given RB's well-known efficiency, whether it has been 'running too hot' or, at the very least, whether it can carry on growing profits further in a climate in which sales growth is flagging and in which it has few obvious cost cuts left to make. Adding to that unease was the sudden departure, last month, of four of the 10 members of RB's executive committee. Demerging Hygiene Home would also fit with what is thought to be Mr Kapoor's long-held ambition of turning RB into a pure consumer healthcare giant. Mead Johnson was an obvious step in bulking up in that area and there are other assets likely to be up for sale in the near future, most notably the consumer healthcare divisions of Pfizer, which includes the Advil, Centrum and Chapstick brands. Merck, another pharma giant, is also thought to be mulling the sale of its consumer healthcare arm, which makes Seven Seas vitamins and Sangobion, the iron supplement. Mr Kapoor insisted today it was too soon to say if RB will bid for either, but is known to be keen. He said integrating either would not be a concern. But RB will not have the field to itself. Nestle has also expressed an interest in bulking up in consumer healthcare, reasoning that, like RB, it is probably better-placed to distribute and sell such products than the big drug companies, which in most - but not all - cases are seeking to focus on their science and on their more profitable pharmaceutical products. It promises to be an interesting 18 months or so in the sector."
2017-10-18,The Football Association apologised to two England women's players over remarks by their ex-manager - just minutes before top bosses faced accusations of blackmail-like behaviour over a race row.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/fa-sorry-but-face-blackmail-claim-over-mark-sampson-race-row-11087154,"In a statement from FA chief executive Martin Glenn, it was revealed both Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence were subject to comments ""discriminatory on grounds of race"" by now-sacked manager Mark Sampson. The public apology came ahead of a bruising encounter for Mr Glenn and his fellow members of the FA hierarchy in front of a committee of MPs. The FA's contrition towards Ms Aluko and Ms Spence followed a months-long scandal to engulf the women's national side. Mr Sampson, who left his role last month, had been accused of telling Ms Aluko to make sure her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus to a friendly match against Germany at Wembley in November 2014. He denied that claim as well as another allegation that he asked Ms Spence, of mixed race, if she had been arrested before, then jokingly suggesting she had been arrested four times. In the FA statement, the organisation revealed new evidence submitted to independent barrister Katharine Newton led her to conclude ""on two separate occasions Mark Sampson made ill-judged attempts at humour, which as a matter of law were discriminatory on grounds of race within the meaning of the Equality Act 2010"". But Ms Newton also concluded Mr Sampson ""was not racist"" and there was ""no evidence"" to support claims Ms Aluko had been subjected to a course of bullying and discriminatory conduct by the former England manager. Moments after the public apology was issued, Ms Aluko - also appearing before the House of Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee - told MPs that Mr Glenn previously intimated to her she would only receive the second part of an agreed £80,000 settlement if she released a statement saying the FA was not institutionally racist. ""I felt that was bordering on blackmail. I categorically refused to write any statement,"" the Chelsea forward said. In his own appearance later, Mr Glenn described how it was the FA's view a Twitter post sent by Ms Aluko broke the terms of the agreement. He did not confirm if the FA would now pay Ms Aluko the money. Mr Glenn also used his committee appearance to retract comments reported by the Guardian newspaper, in which he suggested Ms Newton was employed to investigate the matter because of her sex and ethnicity. ""It was the end of a long day and it came out the wrong day,"" he said. FA chairman Greg Clarke agreed Ms Aluko, who has won 102 England caps but has not been selected since May 2016, was a victim and the organisation had failed in its duty of care to the player. But he was condemned by members of the committee for appearing to describe institutional racism as ""fluff"". ""It's really important in a governance role not to jump to conclusions,"" he told MPs. ""If I'd jumped to a conclusions halfway through this process - 'there's no problem here, nothing's been found, whatever', you have to look at the end what is established."" He added: ""You have to look at the end what is established, putting aside all the fluff about institutional racism, institutional bullying…"", before he was cut off by furious MPs challenging his remarks. Mr Clarke was told his language ""speaks volumes"", before he replied: ""What I was trying to say, maybe badly, is I could get distracted by the irrelevant. I shouldn't have said fluff. ""I could have come in and said, well Katharine Newton said there's no evidence of bullying, of systemic racism. ""But that's not the issue, that's why I mischaracterised it as fluff. ""What I wanted to talk about was the material issue and I apologise for phrasing it badly."" Mr Clarke described being FA chairman as ""career death"" and told MPs it's only because he loves football that he is risking his reputation by taking on the role. He also defended himself from Ms Aluko's criticism of his 14-word email reply to the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) about her complaint. She had told MPs: ""A male player with 102 caps, Wayne Rooney, if they were to send a complaint like that, would he respond like that?"" But Mr Clarke pointed out he was replying to the PFA and not Ms Aluko, adding: ""Sometimes you have to be abrupt."""

Three of the victims are girls aged 11, four are girls aged 13 and the other two are women. All attacks took place in the Greenwich and Lewisham boroughs of southeast London, prompting police to increase patrols and work with schools in the area. CCTV footage captured the man leaving the scene of one of his attacks. Officers say it is essential he is caught quickly and have put out an appeal for the public's help. Superintendent Lee Hill, of Greenwich Police, said: ""These incidents were very frightening for the victims. ""I am appealing to the public to help identify and locate this man as quickly as possible. ""Although none of the victims have suffered physical injury, the effects of becoming a victim of sexual assault can be lasting and traumatic. ""There is a possibility that these incidents are part of a linked series of attacks as a number of victims have provided very similar descriptions of the attacker - a white man aged between 40 and 50 years old, with short white or blond hair. ""This is one line of enquiry detectives are exploring. ""I am concerned that there may be more victims who have not yet come forward and are not receiving the support that they may need. ""I would urge any victims who have not yet come forward to contact police."" Three of the attacks took place within a few streets of each other and within the space of half an hour on Thursday 5 October. The attacks against the 11-year-old girls took place: in Edward Tyler Road, Grove Park, SE12, at 1.15pm on Tuesday 29 August; in Alanthus Close, Lee, SE12, at 8.15am on Thursday 28 September; and in Honor Oak Road, Forest Hill, SE23, at 4pm on Monday 16 October. The attacks against the 13-year-old girls took place: in Ravens Way, Lee, SE12, at 8.20am on Friday 30 June; in Vicars Hill, Ladywell, SE13, at 8.20am on Wednesday 27 September; in Frank Burton Close, Charlton, SE7 at 4.30pm on Thursday 28 September; and in Kidbrooke Park Road, Kidbrooke, SE3, at 9.20am on Thursday 5 October. The other attacks were one against a 27-year-old woman in Kidbrooke Park Road, SE3, at 9.30am and against a 25-year-old woman in Liskeard Gardens at 9.54am, both in Kidbrooke on Thursday 5 October."

The FTSE 100 company wants to remove all HR and payroll clerk roles from in-store completely - hitting around 1,400 people. It said 600 further roles were under threat from a restructuring that would consolidate HR and other support roles across its grocery chain, Argos and Sainsbury's Bank. A spokesman said: ""The UK grocery market is changing at a rapid pace and it's crucial that we transform the way we operate to meet future challenges and continue to provide customers with best in class service. :: UK inflation at five-year high of 3% ""Following a comprehensive review, we are proposing some updates to our HR structures and systems, as well as changes to a number of other support roles, subject to consultation. ""This has been a difficult decision and we appreciate that this will be a tough time for those colleagues affected by the changes. We will support them in any way we can."" The company, which currently employs just under 200,000 people across its businesses, confirmed the cost-cutting plan after the markets had closed for the day. The shake-up by Sainsbury's, which took over Argos last year, is part of a previously announced £500m efficiency drive aimed at allowing the company to invest more in its customer proposition. The so-called big four chains, which also include Tesco, Asda and Morrisons, have been battling a customer drift towards discounters since the end of the financial crisis. The most recent industry data, published by Kantar Worldpanel, showed Sainsbury's market share had fallen to 15.8% in the 12 weeks to 8 October from 16% a year ago. The value of sales for the sector was 3.1% up, with Sainsbury's showing growth of 1.9%. The report painted a fairly rosy picture for the industry as spending on essentials shows little sign of winding down. Wider retail sales have come under pressure from the Brexit-linked squeeze on household budgets as inflation outpaces wage growth."

He died on 16 October, though the circumstances have not been made public. A statement signed by the Butcher family, including Chris's widow Laura, described him as a ""beloved son, brother and husband"". ""Chris was a dedicated Captain in the British Army and we are all so proud of everything that he gave for his country.

He described his brother as ""my hero"", and ""someone I would throw myself in the way of a truck for"". The Butcher family said they had received an ""overwhelming number of messages"" which were ""a testament to how much love and respect surrounded Chris"". A funeral date had not yet been announced.

2017-10-18,The magic number is 301.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/how-would-boundary-changes-affect-political-parties-11084635,"That's the number of parliamentary seats required to secure an overall majority at the next general election if the recommendations of the independent Boundary Commissions are accepted. As part of their brief, the commissioners were instructed to reduce the House of Commons by 50 seats from the current 650. They were also told to remove inequalities in electorate size across constituencies. Three of those commissions, those for England, Scotland and Wales, have now published their revised proposals. The revised recommendations for Northern Ireland are still awaited. A further period of consultation is scheduled but radical changes are not expected. The results of the commissioners' deliberations are certain to create controversy and conflict in Westminster and beyond. This is because if the new boundaries had been in place last June, estimates show the Conservatives would have ""won"" a total of 308 seats - a Commons majority of 16 seats. If the nine seats that Sinn Fein are projected to win on the revised boundaries are also taken into account, then Theresa May would have had a working majority of 25. My colleague Colin Rallings and I were commissioned by a consortium comprising Sky News, BBC News, ITV News and the Press Association to estimate how votes would have been cast in the new constituencies at the last general election in June 2017. These estimates will now become the baseline to compare the parties' performance at the next election scheduled for 2022. Because the total number of seats is reduced, most parties lose out. But some lose out more than others. Overall the Conservatives are set to lose 10 seats but Labour's losses are projected to be three times that number, taking it to about 232 seats. Compared with the actual seats won in 2017 that's a three-point fall for the Tories but one of 11 points for Labour. The news is even worse for the Liberal Democrats. The estimates show the party with only seven seats instead of their current 12. Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru lose two seats but for the latter that halves their representation at Westminster. Labour will cry foul. It loses six seats in Wales, largely because the principality falls from 40 to just 29 seats. It loses another six seats in the North West England and there are losses too in the Midlands and London. Labour argues that the new method of electoral registration has led to it being disadvantaged by the boundary changes. The real number of eligible voters has been under-estimated, particularly in areas that typically support Labour. Other parties will join the protest. The Conservatives, of course, will be determined to see the proposals implemented but this requires parliamentary approval. The DUP's support is essential. But there's the rub: the initial recommendations from the Northern Ireland Commission indicate a net loss of three seats for the party. Under these circumstances it will be reluctant to support the Conservatives and the boundary changes will be rejected. Is this yet another heavy price the Conservatives will be forced to pay for Mrs May's failure to secure an outright win last June?"

The DWP announced that all benefit claim and helplines would change from 0345 and 0845 to freephone numbers. A spokeswoman told Sky News the move would happen ""by the end of next month"". Heidi Allen, who is thought to be leading a group of Tory MPs prepared to rebel over a vote on the latest roll-out of Universal Credit later on Wednesday, hailed the announcement as ""a great start to the day"". But she accused Mr Gauke of ""papering over"" other concerns. The South Cambridgeshire MP was invited to Downing Street on Tuesday afternoon for a meeting with Mr Gauke and Prime Minister Theresa May to express concerns and head off a damaging defeat for the Government. Mr Gauke's announcement came within minutes of the release of figures showing 610,000 people are now on Universal Credit - up 4% from August. Labour, who called for the call charge to be scrapped, responded: ""The increase in the number of people on Universal Credit is worrying given the Government's chaotic handling of its roll-out. ""The Conservatives have finally listened to Labour and scrapped the premium phone helpline for claimants. ""Now they need to listen to the calls of charities and councils and back Labour's motion today to immediately pause and fix the roll-out of Universal Credit, before more people are pushed into rent arrears, poverty and homelessness."" Labour is leading a debate on halting the roll-out later, but accused the Tories of ""dirty tricks"" after a statement on the ""regulation of property agents"" was added to the order of business - limiting its length. The Government's flagship welfare programme has been beset with problems since its roll-out began in the North West in 2013. Tory and Labour MPs have raised concerns over a seven-day wait for claims to be processed, and up to a six-week delay for payment. Some claimants have reportedly fallen into rent arrears or been forced to use food banks as a result. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid admitted the programme could be improved but told Sky News: ""Where Universal Credit has been rolled out, it has helped more and more people accept work. ""You'll be hard pushed to find anyone that says Universal Credit as a system is the wrong system."""

The latest delay comes amid Cabinet disarray over a no-deal Brexit and claims from EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier that stalling negotiations are the fault of the UK and not Brussels. Attacking the delay in the Bill's progress, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""This is further proof that the Government's Brexit strategy is in paralysis.

But Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading anti-Brexit campaigner, said: ""I am not at all surprised at this delay on the EU Withdrawal Bill - it is a badly-drafted Bill, and badly thought through. ""The number of amendments has given ministers a lot to think about, which shows Parliament is taking back control and is already doing its job of scrutiny well on this."" Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the Bill's delays ""make Southern Rail look punctual"".

It also said that a quarter remained permanently stuck on low pay while 48% fluctuated in and out of this category. On average, people stuck in this group have seen their hourly wages rise by just 40p in real terms - stripping out the effects of inflation - over the last ten years. That compares to a £4.83 rise for those who have ""escaped"", said the study, which was carried out by the Resolution Foundation think-tank. :: Four million consumers 'in difficulty' - study Women are more likely to be low paid than men and are far more likely to be stuck at this level, the report found - with the lack of flexible work to fit around childcare responsibilities seen as a key barrier to progress. The report comes a day after official figures showed for the six month in a row that wage rises are lagging behind the increase in the cost of living. Former Labour minister Alan Milburn, who chairs the Social Mobility Commission, said: ""Britain has an endemic low pay problem. ""While record numbers of people are in employment, too many jobs are low skill and low paid. ""Millions of workers - particularly women - are being trapped in low pay with little chance of escape. The consequences for social mobility are dire."" Conor D'Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Britain has one of the highest proportions of low paid work in the developed world. ""And while three-quarters of low-paid workers did manage to move into higher-paying roles at some point over the last decade, the vast majority couldn't sustain that progress."" The report acknowledged the impact of the National Living Wage, which saw the biggest fall in the number of people in low paid work in 40 years last year. But it said there would still be around four million low paid employees in 2020. The analysis defined low pay as hourly earnings below two-thirds of the median hourly wage - excluding tips, commissions or other payments. The low pay threshold was estimated at £8.25 for 2017.

In a statement, his family said: ""God knew this day was coming his response was to spend his precious time as he always had, making music, making memories and expressing deep gratitude to his family and friends for a life well lived. The band, which released its first album in 1987, has a huge following within Canada but has only had limited international success. During his final show, Downie called out to Mr Trudeau, who was at the concert, to help fix problems in Canada's indigenous communities. He is survived by his wife and four children."
2017-10-18,"The High Court has heard shareholders in Lloyds were ""mugged"" when the bank recommended buying Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) at the height of the financial crisis.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/lloyds-investors-mugged-on-hbos-purchase-trial-hears-11086719,"The allegation was made by the barrister representing a group of 5,803 former Lloyds TSB shareholders at the start of a trial aimed at recovering more than £550m from the bank. Richard Hill QC told Mr Justice Norris: ""My clients have suffered catastrophic losses from the acquisition, for which we hold the defendants responsible."" The group, which includes roughly 300 institutional investors such as pension funds, is suing Lloyds Banking Group, former chairman Sir Victor Blank, ex-chief executive Eric Daniels, former chief financial officer Tim Tookey and two other former directors. The class action suit accuses them of recommending the deal to shareholders when no reasonable director would have done so because they knew HBOS had suffered a funding failure and was on ""emergency life support"" from the Bank of England and Lloyds itself. Mr Hill said the circular sent to shareholders deciding how to vote on the acquisition was a ""highly misleading"" document which misrepresented the key information they needed to assess the deal. He told the court: ""The information that would have disclosed it was a bust failed bank was omitted deliberately. ""The opposite impression was given. ""So, although it had reached the same situation as Northern Rock, shareholders were not told that."" The £12bn acquisition left Lloyds saddled with toxic assets - announcing £11bn of losses from HBOS in February 2009 after its £20.3bn Government bailout. Lloyds, which returned to private hands earlier this year and rejected a last-minute settlement offer, is due to give its opening statement on Thursday - the second day of the trial that is expected to last 14 weeks. A spokesman for the bank said of the case: ""The group's position remains that we do not consider there to be any merit to these claims and we will robustly contest this legal action."" A series of claims brought by Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders - which would have seen Fred Goodwin, the bank's former boss, take the stand - were settled before the case came to trial earlier this year."
2017-10-18,"British workers have now been squeezed by six months of falling real-term wages, official figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/jobless-figure-drops-but-wage-growth-fails-to-improve-11086393,"Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.1% in the three months to August, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - well below the rise in the cost of living. It meant that real pay - which takes account of the effect of inflation on spending power - was 0.4% lower over the period, extending a decline in this measure to six months. On a brighter note, unemployment continued to fall over the latest three-month period, dropping by 52,000 to 1.44 million. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.3%, its lowest level since 1975. There were 32.1 million people in work, a rise of 94,000 over the period - and the ONS said employment growth was driven mainly by women. But the wage data highlighted the continued squeeze on household incomes, a day after the ONS reported that inflation last month rose to 3%, its highest level in more than five years. Living standards are still struggling to recover from the aftermath of the financial crisis, which saw real-term pay decline for an extended period from 2009 to 2014.. The latest pay figure - which was slightly higher than expected, though lower than in the three months to July - looks unlikely to derail expectations that the Bank of England will hike interest rates next month. But the pound, trading at just under $1.32 against the US dollar, slipped back a little, as some economists said there would need to be stronger signs of wage growth if the Bank wants to go for another increase in the new year. James Smith, economist at ING Bank, said: ""We don't expect wage growth to go much above 2.1%/2.2% this summer."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady - who is calling for the Chancellor to ditch the cap on many public sector workers' earnings - said: ""Pay packets are taking a hammering. ""This is the sixth month in a row that prices have risen faster than wages. Britain desperately needs a pay rise."" But employment minister Damian Hinds highlighted the improvement in numbers of people in work. He said: ""Our economy is helping to create full-time, permanent jobs which are giving people across the UK the chance of securing a reliable income."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank of England was ""caught between a rock and a hard place"" as it weighed its next interest rate move amid sluggish economic growth. He said: ""Poor wage growth against a background of rising inflation spells trouble for the UK consumer, and for businesses which rely on consumer spending. ""So far the damage appears to be fairly muted, however, as consumer spending has held up surprisingly well. An interest rate rise could change that. ""Paying off your mortgage comes higher in the pecking order than buying a new iPhone, no matter how good the camera is. ""The Bank of England will be wary of the fragile state of the UK consumer as it mulls its next move on interest rates."""

Lord Hain said it has been estimated that around £400m may have been laundered through financial institutions in South Africa.

She told the newspaper: ""President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband."" Mr Trump is reported to have told Sgt Johnson's widow that the soldier ""knew what he signed up for"" during that conversation, adding: ""But when it happens it hurts anyway."" But he has denied those claims, which were revealed by Democrat congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who was also present during the conversation. The US President phoned Sgt Johnson's pregnant widow Myeshia Johnson and spoke to her for about five minutes, according to ABC affiliate WPLG Local 10 in Miami. The conversation happened shortly before Mrs Johnson and the couple's two children - a two-year-old son and six-year-old daughter - arrived at the airport to meet her husband's coffin. Ms Wilson later tweeted: ""Sgt La David Johnson is a hero. ""(Donald Trump) does not possess the character, empathy or grace to be president of the United States."" But President Trump hit back, tweeting: ""Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!"" Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad! The White House later clarified there was no recording of the conversation but Trump staff had listened in on the call. A former Walmart employee, Sgt Johnson enlisted in January 2014 and defied the odds to become a decorated member of the prestigious 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. But the 25-year-old was killed on 4 October along with three other US soldiers after his group was ambushed by more than 50 Islamist militants. He was initially left behind during the evacuation and his body was retrieved nearly two days later. Mr Trump was playing golf as Sgt Johnson's body arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on 7 October. Mr Trump's phone conversation with Mrs Johnson comes just days after he was criticised for saying previous presidents had not called families of fallen services personnel. He told NBC: ""President Obama I think probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn't. ""I don't know, that's what I was told. ""All I can do, all I can do is ask my generals. ""Other presidents did not call. They'd write letters. And some presidents didn't do anything. ""But I like the combination of, I like, when I can, the combination of a call and also a letter."" The comments drew sharp rebukes, with some of Mr Obama's former White House aides expressing outrage at the claim. Some critics say Mr Trump made them to distract attention from what happened to the four soldiers in Niger, which has not yet been fully explained. The others killed in the Niger attack were Staff Sgt Bryan C Black, 35, of Washington; Staff Sgt Jeremiah W Johnson, 39, of Ohio, and Staff Sgt Dustin M Wright, 29, of Georgia. The White House said Mr Trump had called all four families involved and ""offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their families' extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten""."
2017-10-18,"The debate and votes over hundreds of amendments to the crucial EU Withdrawal Bill look to have been delayed until next month, perhaps as late as the middle of November.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/multiple-tory-rebellions-likely-over-eu-withdrawal-bill-11086995,"It comes as the whips struggle to contain multiple Conservative rebellions. The legislation, formerly known as the Great Repeal Bill, has been the subject of hundreds of amendments from MPs concerned about the constitutional and economic implications of the Government's current approach to Brexit. In what one organiser called ""cross-party working on an unprecedented scale"", a dozen amendments already have the names of 10 Tory MPs, while some have as many as 13 MPs. Labour backbenchers have coordinated their work with Tory backbenchers, the Lib Dems, nationalist parties and peers. They have also readied substitute amendments to allow for individual Conservative MPs being convinced to withdraw their concerns. There are six areas in which the MPs expect to defeat the Government or gain significant concessions - constitutional, an exit deal vote, transition, Euratom nuclear safeguards, the environment, and devolution issues. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has emerged as a key figure in this process, and concessions are expected from the Government on a raft of constitutional issues around Henry VIII powers - essentially a change in the law involving little scrutiny from MPs. Other amendments, which might include the demand for an Act of Parliament to approve the exit deal, and therefore votes in both houses, plus statutory requirement for a transition phase along the lines of the PM's Florence speech, and on the Euratom nuclear safety treaty, also have a decent chance of passing. The Government claims there is no delay to the Committee Stage of the EU Withdrawal Bill because it was never timetabled in the first place. The reality is that the consideration of amendments was expected this week, then next week, and now has been pushed back further as the Government tries to work out how to make the numbers work. November includes a week of recess, and a Budget, and subsequent Finance Bill. At least one of the Brexit Bills, Sky News understands, on international sanctions, will start its life in the House of Lords, to try to alleviate a legislative logjam in the Commons. The House of Lords' second reading of the EU Withdrawal Bill might not now take place until next year, possibly clearing in late April or May. The all-out procedural war on the floor of the Commons is organised as never before, and will occur against a backdrop of stalling talks, rising inflation and slowing growth. The Tory whips are not really thinking much beyond how to win the votes before them. For now that includes fending off rebellions on Universal Credit and demands for extra NHS funding."
2017-10-18,There has been a big rise in reports of girls self-harming - with experts suggesting digitial media may be to blame.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171019091114/http://news.sky.com/story/social-media-blamed-for-big-rise-in-girls-self-harming-11087346,"Between 2011 and 2014, reports of self-harm among girls in Britain aged 13 to 16 rose by 68%. The figures come from data collated by researchers from the University of Manchester. They looked at records from 674 general practices, focusing on the number of 10 to 19-year-olds who had self-harmed. Of all those who had self-harmed, almost three quarters (73%) were girls. For girls aged 13 to 16 the rate rose from 45.9 cases per 10,000 individuals in 2011 to 77.0 cases per 10,000 in 2014. The researchers said one of the reasons for such a high rate could be exposure to digital media. They said while such technology can be ""helpful and facilitate access to care...there is also a suggestion that extreme 'connectedness' could have detrimental effects"". Nav Kapur, professor of psychiatry and population health at the University of Manchester, said: ""These results do emphasise the opportunity for earlier intervention in primary care to reduce suicide risk. ""It's very important that young people, parents and carers aren't unduly alarmed by these findings. ""We know that for many young people things get better and they no longer hurt themselves as adults. ""But of course we must take self-harm seriously; it's important to understand its underlying causes."" In about 55% cases of self-harm, there was no referral to mental health services recorded. The report's authors said this suggested ""less severe cases or possible reflection of the challenges in accessing specialist services in a timely manner"". Tom Madders, campaigns director at the charity YoungMinds, said: ""The reasons behind self-harm can be complex, but we know that teenage girls face a wide range of pressures, including school stress, body image issues, bullying and the pressure created by social media. ""As a society, we also need to do more to prevent mental health problems from developing in the first place."" An NSPCC spokesman said: ""Last year we held more than 15,000 counselling sessions about self-harm, and many young people who talked about suicidal feelings also mentioned self-harm. ""Self-harm can often be an expression of a deeper problem which is why early intervention services to support these children are vital."" Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said: ""It's worrying to see the number of young people who self-harm and experience suicidal feelings is increasing, I want every young person to be able to seek and access help when they need it."" The study is published in the British Medical Journal."

During the undercover sting operation, he told the officer he was ready to put on a suicide vest and ""press the button on the same day"". He came into contact with the officer after he sent messages online to people he thought could help him get to Syria, the court heard. Jamil also bought a punch bag and a pull-up bar to boost his fitness in preparation, but told the undercover officer he was cautious of drawing attention so he bought a football to play with ""so it's less suspicious"". He was arrested by counter-terror police in April last year, days before he planned to fly to Turkey. The defendant denied the charges and insisted he was hearing voices and wanted to go to Syria to be exorcised of ""jinns"" - spirits - that were plaguing him. On Thursday he was convicted of being engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect to the intention to commit acts of terrorism. Jurors heard how the avid computer gamer, who suffered from periods of mental illness, became obsessed with ""martyrdom"" after searching the internet for IS propaganda. He had told the undercover officer: ""If you or some brother you know can put an explosive belt on me and tell me how to press, as soon as possible for security reasons, I can do something in the UK even tomorrow after I find a good target.""

2017-10-19,Theresa May is facing new pressure to order town halls to empty household bins weekly after Government figures revealed fly-tipping incidents topped a million last year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171020040346/http://news.sky.com/story/new-pressure-on-bin-collections-over-shock-fly-tipping-figures-11088458,"The shock figures, from Michael Gove's environment department, are up 7% on last year and the highest since 2008. It means councils have been left with a clean-up bill of £58m. Opposition MPs are blaming cuts in Government funding for town halls, which they claim has left councils cash-strapped and forced to empty bins fortnightly or even every three weeks. But Downing Street says while the Government supports ""frequent and comprehensive bin collection"" it is up to councils to decide how often they empty bins - and they have powers to tackle fly-tipping. The phasing out of weekly bin collections has been a contentious political issue since Tony Blair's Labour Government allowed councils to switch to fortnightly collections to encourage people to recycle. Ahead of the 2010 General Election, former Tory leader David Cameron said weekly bin collections were a ""basic right"" and Eric Pickles pledged to restore them when he was Communities Secretary in the Coalition Government. Mr Pickles - now Sir Eric - also gave councils new powers, which came into force in May last year, to issue on-the-spot fixed penalty notices of £150 to £400 for small-scale fly-tipping. The new figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) reveal that in 2016-17, 56,000 of these fixed penalty notices were handed out by councils to people caught illegally dumping. Two-thirds of fly-tipping was household waste, the figures also revealed. Typical examples included dumping bags of household waste, fridges and other white goods, along with building rubble, tyres, asbestos and even animal carcasses. The highest number of fly-tipping cases were in London boroughs and big cities such as Manchester and Liverpool. Asked if the Prime Minister would like to see more weekly bin collections, a Number 10 spokesman said: ""Fly-tipping is never acceptable, no matter what the circumstances. ""Councils have a full range of tools at their disposal to tackle this issue. ""We have been very clear that we support frequent and comprehensive bin collections, it's up to councils to decide on the litter collection strategy that works for their residents."" But Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse said: ""Britain's fly-tipping epidemic is spiralling out of control. Too many fly-tippers are being let off the hook. ""The Government needs to do more to ensure those responsible are brought to justice. ""Cash-strapped councils need more funding so they can increase bin collections and stop charging people to get rid of large household goods."" Martin Tett, of the Local Government Association, said: ""Clearing up fly-tipping is costing councils millions of pounds per year - money that could be spent on other services, like caring for the elderly, protecting children or tackling homelessness. ""It is unacceptable that they are having to spend vast amounts each year tackling this scourge."""

The opposition motion passed by 299 votes to zero, with Sarah Wollaston the only Tory MP to vote as she backed Labour's position. The non-binding vote was a symbolic victory for Jeremy Corbyn's party and comes after previous Labour motions on tuition fees and NHS pay were passed without Government resistance. On Thursday, Ms Leadsom was challenged over the Government's decision to abstain on recent opposition motions, prompted by Theresa May's lack of Commons majority and the threat of Tory rebellions. Commons Speaker John Bercow has reacted angrily to the Government's position on non-binding votes. Veteran Conservative Sir Edward Leigh urged the Cabinet minister to take a ""long-term point of view"" over the prospect of the Tories one day facing a Labour minority administration. Calling for a minister to come to Parliament to respond to the Universal Credit vote, he said: ""Frankly, the road to tyranny is paved with executives ignoring Parliament."" Fellow Tory Peter Bone also called for the Government to formally respond to the defeat by explaining what action will be taken on the implementation of benefits changes, which have been criticised by MPs from all parties. ""On rare occasions, I have been in trouble with the whips for not voting for Government policy,"" he said. ""Yesterday would have been the first time that had I voted for Government policy, I would have been in trouble. ""We cannot ignore the will of the House."" Also speaking during the session of business questions, the SNP's Pete Wishart described ""an anti-democratic shambles"" and an ""utter embarrassment"" for Parliament. Valerie Vaz, Labour's shadow leader of the House of Commons, attacked a ""disorganised Government who are disrespectful to the House"". In response to the criticism, Ms Leadsom insisted there is ""no precedent being set"" while she assured the House that ministers from the Department for Work and Pensions will update MPs on the progress of the Universal Credit roll-out. She added concerns about the benefits shake-up are ""absolutely being listened to"" and acted on. Labour will try and force a fresh defeat on the Government during next Wednesday's opposition day debate on social care funding."

The FA issued an apology to two England women's players on Wednesday over remarks by their ex-manager, minutes before the pair were grilled in Parliament by a commons committee. A report found that players Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence were subject to comments ""discriminatory on grounds of race"" by now-sacked manager Mark Sampson. When Sanderson, who was one of two players quizzed by the committee, along with Aluko, was asked whether she felt those at the top of the FA were sorry enough, she said: ""For me, personally, no, I don't think they were."" She added: ""I think they lacked empathy. They lacked compassion. It was difficult for them to answer straight the questions that were being (asked)."" Sampson, who left his role in September, had been accused of telling Aluko to make sure her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus to a friendly match against Germany at Wembley in November 2014. He denied that claim, as well as another allegation that he asked Spence, of mixed race, if she had been arrested before, then jokingly suggesting she had been arrested four times. In the FA statement, the organisation revealed new evidence submitted to independent barrister Katharine Newton led her to conclude that ""on two separate occasions Sampson made ill-judged attempts at humour, which as a matter of law were discriminatory on grounds of race within the meaning of the Equality Act 2010"". But Ms Newton also concluded Sampson ""was not racist"" and there was ""no evidence"" to support claims Aluko had been subjected to a course of bullying and discriminatory conduct by the former England manager. Sanderson said she was pleased with the report's conclusions because it showed procedures at the FA could be followed ""properly"". ""It's been a long journey. For myself, for Eniola. For me it was important to come... and support her... because I always knew she was telling the truth,"" she said. ""This hasn't been a nice process for us. Particularly for Eni, to be called a liar, for people to not know what's actually going on. But after yesterday, we feel very satisfied with what happened, but at the same time we want change and hopefully this might inflict change to come. Asked if if the management needed to go before changes could be made, she said: ""It's not my place to say. It's down to them to come to their own conclusions and self-reflect on how this process has turned out. ""It didn't need to be this way. It's not good for women's football. It's not good for the FA.

Ramsay, his cameraman Adam Cole and security adviser Mike Mawhinney are the first British broadcast team to enter the city since its liberation. Here Ramsay describes the scale of the destruction and the joy in the city at the victory against IS: This was a long, hard battle into the heart of Islamic State's evil-filled core. Even on the outskirts of Raqqa the fighting was intense, destructive and deadly. It is an eerie drive into a major town now utterly empty of civilians and any form of life other than soldiers. The fighting has only stopped in the last few days. Most of Raqqa is now a silent witness to the force needed to destroy an organisation that planned and brought murder and mayhem from here, across the world. As methodically as they can, the forces of the victorious multi-ethnic SDF use armoured bulldozers supported by armoured trucks to push into the rubble-filled streets. Occasionally you hear the boom of an explosion. They will be hitting mines and booby traps here for weeks. But they are savouring the victory nonetheless. Soldiers pose for pictures and greet us with smiles and victory signs. Many look utterly exhausted. Perwer (his nom de guerre) stood with me as we looked at one street that is a mass of destroyed buildings and rubble. ""I am from Kobane and it was terrible there but it is smaller, this is worse,"" he said as we were enveloped in dust from a passing truck. He smiled. ""They said we couldn't do this. We destroyed the Isis myth,"" and clapped me on the back. The destruction in the centre is quite incredible. The combination of airstrikes, artillery and street-to-street fighting an extraordinary demonstration in demolition. :: The enormous costs of Islamic State's demise in Raqqa Some 90% of the city is destroyed but what has been achieved here by this force is not to be underestimated. Around the roundabout where IS used to carry out public executions, leaving the bodies for days or weeks, a convoy of military trucks career around waving flags and beeping their horns. They are world famous now, but the women's brigades of the Kurdish YPJ really are quite something. They have been a constant and equal part of the victory here and in many other battles. This was their opportunity to lead their own celebrations and to remember their own many dead. Amongst those celebrating was Briton Kimmy Taylor. A fighter, she is pretty famous here and indeed worldwide. :: The rise and fall of Islamic State in Raqqa She believes what has been achieved in this war by the women has sent a message to the world about empowerment and respect. ""I'm a revolutionary and I will go on. One day I will be martyred, but I go on,"" she told me when I asked what was next. ""I want to go home for a bit and then do some work as an ambassador for what has been achieved. Then I want to return here and see this new society,"" she said. Islamic State is not finished as an entity for sure. Its ideology has leached across the planet through social media and hate-filled sermons. But they have been smashed here; in Kobane, in Mosul and now in Raqqa. The costs have been terrible. But Islamic State has lost. For me reporting that it really is quite something."
2017-10-19,Everton captain Ashley Williams and his club could be punished by UEFA after a melee erupted following the skipper's push on Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171020040346/http://news.sky.com/story/everton-may-be-punished-over-pitch-brawl-with-lyon-players-11089116,"The keeper fell to the ground and ended up by the advertising hoardings during their Europa League match at Goodison Park. What followed was a heated confrontation between several players from both sides, including Williams and Lopes. And during the second-half incident, a fan holding a young child appeared to shove the keeper's head. The supporter then looked like he tried to slap Lopes on the shoulder. The Lyon players noticed that and shouted in his direction. Williams appeared to raise a hand to Lucas Tousart's face during the melee. Things eventually calmed down and Williams was given a yellow card as was Lyon striker Bertrand Traore. Everton were behind 1-0 at that point. Williams would later go on to score, cancelling out Nabil Fekir's penalty. But Traore's 75th-minute winner earned Lyon a 2-1 success. Speaking about the incident after the match, Williams said: ""It's what happens, it's football. It is what it is."" He told BT Sport 2: ""It's high emotions. We want to win the game, they want to win the game and stuff happens. That was just one of those times."""
2017-10-19,Is one of Britain's largest companies preparing to break itself in two?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171020040346/http://news.sky.com/story/durex-splits-from-brasso-and-cillit-bang-in-group-shake-up-at-rb-11086813,"That is the conclusion from the news that consumer goods giant RB, formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, is reorganising itself into two divisions. One division, RB Health, takes in heathcare brands including Neurofen, Strepsils, Gaviscon, Clearasil and Dettol, as well as 'lifestyle' brands such as Durex, Scholl and Veet. The second, RB Hygiene Home, will own household products brands such as Air Wick, Finish, Calgon, Mr Sheen, Vanish, Brasso and Cillit Bang. This is a big shake-up for the UK's 13th-largest company, which was formed by the 1999 merger between British firm Reckitt & Colman with the Dutch company Benckiser. With a stock market value of just under £50bn, RB is a vast business that, during the last decade or so, has made a number of shrewd acquisitions of assets that it successfully identified as having good growth prospects - then managed them more aggressively than their existing owners. These included the old Boots Healthcare business in 2005, which brought in Strepsils and Neurofen; the 2008 acquisition of Adams Healthcare, which brought in Mucinex and the 2010 takeover of SSL, which added Scholl and Durex. The biggest roll of the dice came when, earlier this year, RB announced it was splashing out $16.7bn for the US baby milk maker Mead Johnson. Some businesses have been offloaded along the way, including the famous Colman's mustard brand, but most notably Indivior, a provider of opioids to people seeking to lose their heroin addiction, which was floated off in 2014. Following the Mead Johnson deal, RB also announced plans to sell its remaining food brands, including the French's mustard business. Announcing the move, RB said: ""The two business units will together form one RB - a single company devoted to delivering on our mission of creating healthier lives and happier homes."" Yet this separation of the two businesses will inevitably lead to speculation RB plans to float off its Hygiene Home arm which, accounting for 40% of sales, is the smaller of the two divisions. Adding fuel to this is that Rakesh Kapoor, RB's chief executive, will be personally heading RB Health. There is a logic to the reorganisation. Along with other consumer goods giants like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, RB is wrestling both with changing consumer habits and tastes, including disruption from internet start-ups that sell direct to the consumer and competition from supermarket own brands. All at a time when the rising price of commodities like palm oil, a key ingredient, are rising. A more formal break-up would undoubtedly be welcomed. Investors have started to fret that sales growth has stalled at RB - concerns accentuated today when RB admitted that, during the three months to the end of September, sales were down 1% on the same period on a like-for-like basis. Analysts had been expecting growth during the quarter. Adding to those worries have been a string of setbacks, including a cyberattack in June this year and an earlier scandal in South Korea involving the sale of a humidifier disinfectant linked to the deaths of more than 100 people. This has got some shareholders worrying that, given RB's well-known efficiency, whether it has been 'running too hot' or, at the very least, whether it can carry on growing profits further in a climate in which sales growth is flagging and in which it has few obvious cost cuts left to make. Adding to that unease was the sudden departure, last month, of four of the 10 members of RB's executive committee. Demerging Hygiene Home would also fit with what is thought to be Mr Kapoor's long-held ambition of turning RB into a pure consumer healthcare giant. Mead Johnson was an obvious step in bulking up in that area and there are other assets likely to be up for sale in the near future, most notably the consumer healthcare divisions of Pfizer, which includes the Advil, Centrum and Chapstick brands. Merck, another pharma giant, is also thought to be mulling the sale of its consumer healthcare arm, which makes Seven Seas vitamins and Sangobion, the iron supplement. Mr Kapoor insisted today it was too soon to say if RB will bid for either, but is known to be keen. He said integrating either would not be a concern. But RB will not have the field to itself. Nestle has also expressed an interest in bulking up in consumer healthcare, reasoning that, like RB, it is probably better-placed to distribute and sell such products than the big drug companies, which in most - but not all - cases are seeking to focus on their science and on their more profitable pharmaceutical products. It promises to be an interesting 18 months or so in the sector."

With moving poignancy, Berry, whose son William died in a car accident, said: ""If I could have one more minute with William, what would I say? I would thank him. I would thank him for being a brilliant son."" Ferdinand, whose wife Rebecca died in 2015, said: ""I'd definitely ask her about what she wanted with the children growing up, at different stages, poignant moments in their development. Tell her I love her... there's loads."" And television star Jason Watkins, whose two-year-old daughter Maude died in 2011, said: ""I think if I were to have another minute with her I think I'd say I'd remind her of all the wonderful things that she'd given us and all the wonderful things that we did. ""And talk about as much as I could in that minute. All the wonderful feelings she gave us and the joy, and that she won't be forgotten and that she's handed on all her beauty to her sister and to us, and that we'll never forget her."" Every day 111 children in the UK lose a parent. And over 10,000 children and young people die each year. The charity Child Bereavement UK made the One More Minute campaign to highlight the needs of children and families facing bereavement. The charity's CEO, Ann Chalmers, said: ""What we hope is that it will raise awareness of the experience of families. We hope that it's something people will relate to. We hope that if people feel touched by the films they'll be interested in looking at the One More Minute website and finding out more about the charity and its work. And we also hope that people will find a way to access the support that they might need after bereavement."" One of the charity's young ambassadors is Rebecca Gascoigne whose mum died from breast cancer when she was five. She is also filmed in the campaign video and says the charity helped her accept and manage her grief. ""They turned my life around. I started receiving individual counselling and then I progressed onto group projects. But through all that, the charity have showed me my life didn't have to end when my mother's did, and that I have so much to live for and so much to make her proud of. And that, I wouldn't have seen without their help."""
2017-10-19,"An 18-month-old girl was probably ""thrown against a hard floor"" and ""shaken violently"" before she died, a court has been told.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171020040346/http://news.sky.com/story/toddler-elsie-scully-hicks-probably-thrown-against-a-hard-floor-before-she-died-11088247,"Elsie Scully-Hicks was found to have suffered three separate areas of subdural bleeding, a skull fracture and fractures to three ribs and her leg. The toddler, who also had retinal haemorrhages in both eyes when she was admitted to University Hospital Wales on 25 May last year, died four days later. Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, denies murdering Elsie at their home in Cardiff. Scully-Hicks and his husband Craig Scully-Hicks, 36, adopted Elsie two weeks before the alleged incident. Matthew Scully-Hicks, a part-time fitness instructor from Delabole, Cornwall, had been looking after Elsie at the couple's home in Llandaff, Cardiff, at the time. The trial at Cardiff Crown Court was told by Dr Stephen Rose, a consultant paediatrician, that it was ""likely that Elsie Scully-Hicks had been shaken violently and that her head had been rocked backwards and forwards so that her head was flexed down on to her chest and flexed backwards"". He said: ""This mechanism would then cause the subdural bleeding, or the bleeds around the brain, and the retinal haemorrhages and also it would cause her to stop breathing."" On Elsie's skull fracture, Dr Rose added: ""There must have been a cause of the fracture; skull fractures don't occur spontaneously and so the only mechanism for a skull fracture is if there was a blow to the head, either during the shaking injury which culminated in Elsie being thrown against a hard floor, or possibly her head being knocked against a wall."" He said microfractures to the back of three of Elsie's ribs were ""caused by crushing injuries"". Defending, Robert O'Sullivan QC asked Dr Rose if the absence of serious neck injury in Elsie would cause him to further consider whether there could have been this ""violent rocking motion"". Dr Rose replied that it did not because a child's spine is flexible so there would be no reason for any damage to that part of the child's body. Mr O'Sullivan asked if Elise could have sustained her injuries while in a babyseat in a car, but the consultant said it was unlikely because he would ""expect the neck muscles still to be in play and therefore control her head movements"". Elsie had been well throughout the day of her admission to hospital, had gone to playgroup and eaten at home before Scully-Hicks called the emergency services at 6.20pm. The court earlier heard that he had changed Elsie's nappy on the rug in the living room and had then taken her clothes and dirty nappy out of the room. He said that when he came back to the living room two or three minutes later, the child was still on the floor but was not breathing or moving. The trial is expected to last for five weeks."
2017-10-19,Mobile phone firms are denying they hide charges of more than £1 per day for handsets after fixed-term contracts expire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171020040346/http://news.sky.com/story/loyalty-penalty-of-over-1-a-day-for-top-smartphones-report-11088684,"Citizens Advice has accused three major players of failing to reduce bills to reflect that a phone has been paid for - demanding providers make their billing more transparent. It alleged people with Vodafone were paying up to £38 monthly for top-end smartphones because they remained on the same tariff after the conclusion of a fixed-term contract - usually two years. The charity said EE and Three were still charging up to £34 for handsets. Citizens Advice concluded customers were being penalised for loyalty and demanded the industry regulator, Ofcom, step in unless operators raised their game. Its research found the over 65s were most likely to be caught out by the billing issue, with 23% of such customers on a handset-inclusive deal remaining on it for more than 12 months past the end of the fixed contract. Customers have a choice of remaining with the same operator on the same contract, taking out a new deal or switching to another provider at the end of their fixed-term. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""It is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for. ""Phone providers must now make sure that any customers staying in a contract past the end of a fixed deal have their monthly bill reduced to reflect the cost of the handset. ""Providers could make it much easier for consumers to compare prices by separating out the cost of handsets from the cost of services like data and minutes for all contracts, that way it would be much clearer what they're paying for."" The Government responded to the report by supporting the charity's recommendations while mobile operators insisted nothing was being hidden. EE said: ""Separating phone and tariff doesn't always represent the best deal for consumers. ""It can sometimes result in them paying more, and EE customers have the flexibility to choose the tariff and upfront phone cost that's right for them. ""We send our customers regular updates about their options before and after they reach the end of their contract, and the vast majority of our customers upgrade to a new phone or move to a SIM-only plan near the end of theircontract."" Three said the terms of its contracts were always clear and customers were urged to get in touch if they wanted to change their plan at the end of the fixed term. A Vodafone UK spokeswoman said: ""Wherever possible, we contact customers nearing the end of their contract to offer them a range of options."""

In a speech in New York, Mr Bush said: ""Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication."" Although he did not mention the president by name, Mr Bush was clearly criticising the current administration and its controversial policies. Mr Bush said: ""Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed."" :: Trump offered grieving military father $25k He said argument ""turns too easily into animosity,"" and ""disagreement escalates into dehumanisation"". Republican Mr Bush has remained tight-lipped on his thoughts about Mr Trump since he won the White House last November, unlike his Democratic successor Barack Obama. In his speech at the Bush Institute's Spirit of Liberty, Mr Bush, 71, went on: ""We've seen nationalism distorted into nativism and forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America. ""We've seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty. At times it can seem like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together."" Mr Bush said there was ""fading confidence"" in free markets and international trade and noted the ""return of isolationist sentiments"" in the country. He said that while it was important not to ignore the concerns of people whose jobs may have been lost to global economic forces, ""we cannot wish globalisation away"". Mr Bush also stressed the importance of welcoming refugees and dissidents to US shores and called for the country to pass its civic ideals on to the next generation. He added: ""Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them."" Mr Bush's attack comes days after a speech by another major Republican national figure Senator John McCain who appeared to rebuke Mr Trump's ideas and politics. Mr McCain attacked what he described as ""half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems""."

The previous year's total was 4.6m. The ONS said crime it called ""violent,"" including knife crime, sex offences and violence against the person, surged by 19%. There was a 10% increase in the violence with injury bracket, attributed to a jump in recorded assaults. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences and published on the same day as the official crime figures, suggests there were 10.8m offences overall. It did, though, record a nine percent decrease in like-for-like crimes compared to the previous year. The number of murders fell by two percent, with forces logging 664 offences, but attempted murders, boosted by recent terror attacks, saw a ""substantial increase"" of 59%. Knife crime rose again, as police recorded nearly 37,000 incidents in all, the highest number since comparable data records began seven years ago. The Metropolitan Police had the largest jump, accounting for nearly half of the rise, but 38 of 44 police forces saw an increase in crimes involving a knife or sharp instrument. Sex crimes also saw a sharp rise of 19% to just under 130,000, including a 22% increase in rape offences. The ONS report said: ""Most of this volume increase was thought to result from improved recording practices but it is likely that rises in the most serious categories reflect genuine rises in violent crime.

Greg Morgan, warden for the RSPB reserve, said there is so much fishing gear floating in the water around the island that the birds mistake it for the seaweed that they should be using. He said: ""We estimate there are 18 tonnes of plastic in the nests on the island. ""The chicks sit on the nest. As they turn, the plastic gets twisted around their leg and ensnares them. ""They should have flown away by now. Eventually the adults give up and they are left to starve."" We saw birds with plastic twine twisted so tight around their legs that it had cut through to the bone. Other birds were already dead, their feet tethered to the nest by rope. :: Sky Ocean rescue: How to get involved Surveys show 80% of the nests on Grassholm contain plastic. Some of it is swept from as far as North America by the Gulf Stream. The RSPB lands on the island every October, when most of the gannets have flown south for the winter, to save as many of the remaining birds as they can. Over the 12 years that conservationists have been landing on the island, they've cut free 637 birds. ""This is out of sight, out of mind,"" said Mr Morgan. ""People have no idea that this (plastic) is coursing through our seas. We need to raise awareness"" Lisa Morgan, also an RSPB warden (and Greg's wife), admitted that they are firefighting. There is too much plastic to remove - and even attempting a clear-up could put the whole colony at risk. ""Birds use the same nests every year,"" she said. ""If we were to take all of that away, remove all the nests, it would destroy the way the gannetry is built up over time. It's just not an option. ""Gannets love this stuff. Once it is here it will be here for many years to come."" Plastic fishing nets, ropes and pots are a growing problem. Worldwide 640,000 tonnes a year break free and drift through the oceans, harming wildlife. Sarah Parmor, a volunteer, said: ""It makes you feel angry. If people could see (the plastic) here it would make them think about what they are doing in their own lives.

It follows the #MeToo campaign, which saw thousands of people recount experiences of being verbally abused, molested, groped or raped. The latest hashtag however, takes the movement a step further with victims naming their alleged attackers. One woman spoke about an encounter with a photographer. She wrote: ""A photographer told me 'we could do the photos, or we could just have sex'."" :: Alyssa Milano's #MeToo tweet gets thousands of replies Another woman wrote: ""One bouncer rescued me from a guy in a nightclub, only to then say he deserved a kiss for his trouble."" Marlène Schiappa, France's minister of gender equality, hailed the campaign. ""Twitter cannot replace legal action but it is a first step for many women,"" she said. ""Anything that allows women to talk is a good method. ""I understand that being behind a screen can make it easier to put extremely difficult issues into words.""

He has ""unequivocally denied"" the claims against him and has not been charged with any offence. :: BFI withdraws Harvey Weinstein's fellowship Ms Schiappa announced plans for a new law against sexual harassment and violence that would fine men for behaviour such as wolf-whistling.

The ex-universities minister branded Oxbridge colleges ""fiefdoms of entrenched privilege"" and demanded greater action to increase diversity over the ""shocking"" figures. The data, secured by Mr Lammy through Freedom of Information requests, reveals: :: The University of Cambridge made more offers to applicants from four of the Home Counties (Hertfordshire, Surrey, Kent and Oxfordshire) than the whole of the North of England between 2010 to 2015. :: Both universities draw half their students from the South East and London, with around 11% from the Midlands and 15% from the North. :: In each year between 2010 to 2015, 13 of the University of Oxford's 38 colleges did not make a single offer to a black A Level applicant. :: Less than 1% of Cambridge offers went to Pakistani applicants and 1% to black applicants between 2010 to 2015. :: The proportion of offers that both universities made to applicants from the top two social classes rose from 79% in 2010, to 82% at Oxford and 81% at Cambridge in 2015. Tottenham MP Mr Lammy said: ""Overall, the picture painted by this data is of two institutions that overwhelmingly draw their students from a privileged minority in the South of England."" The former barrister is calling for Oxbridge to end their collegiate admissions system for a centralised process to address shortcomings. He also wants foundation years for those from under-represented sections of society; for the universities to directly contact talented students from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds to encourage them to apply; and to copy the US Ivy League's system of giving weight to an applicant's social class and local authority. Mr Lammy said: ""An Oxbridge degree is still the golden ticket in our society and a gateway to the top jobs so the Government has a responsibility to hold Oxbridge to account."" He claimed it was ""not good enough"" for the universities to blame the school system. In response, the University of Cambridge pointed to its highest ever level of undergraduate acceptances for black and minority ethnic background students (21.8%) in 2016. The university's 2017 figures also show the highest proportion of state-educated students in 35 years. A spokesperson said: ""We aim to widen participation further whilst maintaining high academic standards. ""Our admissions decisions are based on academic considerations alone. We are committed to admitting the best students who will thrive on our courses. ""The greatest barrier to participation at selective universities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds is low attainment at school. ""We assess the achievements of these students in their full context to ensure that students with great academic potential are identified."" The University of Oxford said students from black and minority ethnic backgrounds made up 15.9% of its 2016 undergraduate intake, double the figure in 2010. A spokesperson said solving the problem would be ""a long journey that requires huge, joined-up effort across society - including from leading universities like Oxford - to address serious inequalities""."

But with an expected decline in workers from Europe, the illegal immigrants we spoke to are hoping it could provide an opportunity for some kind of amnesty. Selvarasa Sabesan, 31, told me: ""We believe that we can come up and get an offer from the Government because the European people will go out when Brexit happens so when they go out, the British Government will need people to do the low paid jobs so we believe that they will offer us some opportunity to become legal."" We met Mr Selvarasa and his friend Balasingam Kumaresan, 33, who work illegally in a takeaway shop preparing food and doing odd jobs. The owner of the shop risks heavy fines and even jail for giving work to illegal immigrants. Mr Balasingam said: ""We get pocket money - sometimes £15 to £20 for a full day's work - for one day. ""We get two meals a day given by the shop - chicken. But life very difficult."" We gained a rare insight into the lives of illegal immigrants living in the shadows. Fearful of being arrested and deported, they told us they want to become hard working members of society. But they dare not risk interaction with their local community for fear of someone becoming suspicious and reporting them to the council or the police. We followed the men home from the takeaway at the end of their shift, and found they were living in a garage with a group of Tamils from Sri Lanka. Most of the group sleeping rough here came on fake visas, saying they were fleeing persecution. Some illegal immigrants are no doubt exploited as cheap labour, while others get work through pity. In the EU referendum, immigration was one of the key issues, with some voters wanting open borders with Europe to stop. But the irony is that these immigrants now think Brexit could benefit them. We also met Ashanthan Thiyagarajah, who sleeps in a stock room at the back of a corner shop. He, like many illegal immigrants, came on a student visa which has now expired.

He said at the time that he had to take responsibility for the local authority's ""perceived failings"". In a statement issued on Thursday, he said he will not run again as a councillor because his staying on might be a ""distraction"". ""The public inquiry into (the fire's) causes, and the devastating speed with which it spread, is now under way and I will help it in any way that I can,"" he said. ""I have greatly enjoyed my years on the council representing the residents of Brompton & Hans Town and most recently serving as leader of the council. ""However, my continuation as a councillor is likely to serve as a distraction as the council lobbies the Government to address these issues and I have therefore decided not to stand again as a candidate at next year's elections,"" he added. Mr Paget-Brown, who has been a councillor for 31 years, became the focus of fierce criticism of the local authority's handling of the disaster, which prompted the Government to send in a specialist taskforce to help the recovery effort. He lost further credibility when he when he shut out the public and journalists from the first full council meeting since the fire, in a move criticised by Downing Street. In his statement, he again denied accusations that the council had pursued a policy of so-called ""social cleansing"" in the borough, prompted by a programme of regenerating and rebuilding post-war estates. ""All tenants and resident leaseholders would have been offered new homes in these developments and there would have been additional homes for sale or rent,"" he said. ""So we would have built more homes of better quality for local people with sustained investment in the stock. Under this policy there would have been no 'social cleansing'."" The local elections take place in May."
2017-10-19,Harvey Weinstein has been banned by the Academy and the BFI and suspended from BAFTA - based only on accusations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171020040346/http://news.sky.com/story/does-weinstein-scandal-mask-institutional-problem-11087955,"It is an odd thing, the institutional mentality. At times it is random, imprecise, unfair; what applies to one person seldom applies to all, and there seems to be a blatant indifference to the rule of law. Harvey Weinstein has been accused by more than 40 women of either sexual harassment, sexual assault or even rape - but he has denied the allegations against him and has yet to be charged with any offence. However, the Academy, it seems, felt pressured to react to the dozens of stars who were ""shocked and disgusted"" by his alleged behaviour, and on Sunday announced it was banning the film mogul. The group, which has more than 8,000 members, said the film producer ""does not merit the respect of his colleagues"". :: Hollywood's PR machine and its secret scandal BAFTA was even swifter, making the announcement just five days after the New York Times published its first expose. ""While BAFTA has previously been a beneficiary of Mr Weinstein's support for its charitable work, it considers the reported alleged behaviour completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA's values,"" the organisation said. Without going into the details of legal procedures, where everyone is innocent until proven guilty - yawn, right? - how do the good folks at the British Academy Of Film and Television Arts feel about running a retrospective on Roman Polanski? :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's infamous casting couch In 1978, the French-Polish director admitted the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. Twenty-five years later, he won both best director and best film for The Pianist at the BAFTA awards. He also won best director at the Oscars. Whatever problems these institutions have with the Weinstein claims, they didn't have with Polanski. The British Film Institute was not as quick to condemn Weinstein, but has now withdrawn the fellowship awarded to him in 2002. ""Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" the BFI said in a statement. ""Everyone working in the film industry - in any industry - should be safe and respected in the workplace."" By acting like this, of both judge and jury of accused filmmakers, actors or producers, film institutions risk being dragged into the spotlight by the industry and the media. The most sensible thing to do would be to write up a code of conduct for members to protect actors from casting couch-type situations. The BFI has now promised to do so, incorporating it in its diversity standards. They should wait for court proceedings, if any, to be over to make any sort of decision regarding members - or risk fuelling a lynch mob-like mentality, with subjects trialled by their peers and social media before they are even charged with an offence. Granted, Weinstein could end up facing a jury one day, and I'm certainly not defending him - but we shouldn't be treating him as a criminal either. Not yet, anyway."

2017-10-19,There is further evidence of growing frustration over the direction of Brexit talks in a tweet by one of the most powerful bankers in the United States.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171020040346/http://news.sky.com/story/goldman-boss-signals-brexit-shift-to-frankfurt-in-tweet-11088162,"The chief executive of Goldman Sachs - America's fifth-largest bank by market value - took aim at London following a series of meetings in Frankfurt, tweeting: ""Great meetings, great weather, really enjoyed it. Good, because I'll be spending a lot more time there. #Brexit."" Lloyd Blankfein made his remarks two weeks after the bank signed a lease to substantially increase its office space in Germany's financial centre. Just left Frankfurt. Great meetings, great weather, really enjoyed it. Good, because I'll be spending a lot more time there. #Brexit It currently employs up to 200 people in Frankfurt but experts have suggested it could soon house up to 1,000 staff in the new complex. The investment bank has refused to discuss numbers in detail and - like many rivals in financial services - is yet to declare its hand on whether it will relocate staff from the City of London or hire additional staff to guarantee its current access to the single market. Nevertheless Frankfurt - home to the European Central Bank - is on course to become the largest recipient of Brexit-related new business within the EU ahead of the UK's looming divorce. Goldman currently has around 6,500 workers in the UK. While banks are making contingency plans to cover their so-called passporting rights, there is growing anger within the wider business community about a lack of clarity on the UK's future trading status. The EU has refused to consider such talks until there is greater progress on issues such as citizens' rights, Ireland's border and, crucially, the divorce bill. Sky News reported in the summer how the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, met the Goldman board for private talks to reassure bosses he was pushing for a lengthy transition deal to smooth the exit process. That possibility - and Mr Hammond's own position - has since become mired by Tory infighting. Corporate nerves have become further frayed as Prime Minister Theresa May comes under pressure from Brexit supporters to pull out of the talks altogether. Commenting on Mr Blankfein's remarks, a Downing Street spokesman responded: ""We're not going to comment on each individual statement but lets be clear, London is and will remain the world's leading financial centre."" The banker has not been afraid to criticise governments and national leaders in his short time on Twitter - despite only joining in June. Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement His first post took aim at Donald Trump after he pulled the US out of the Paris climate deal. He wrote: ""Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement."" He has also previously been complimentary about Britain. During a visit to the country following a terror attack in the capital he said: ""Beautiful day in London. Streets busy, everyone out, no concession to terror threats. Have to admire the Brits."""

At Corals bookmakers in Margate, he used a pipette as he pretended to test for fraudulent bank notes, walking away with £4,840. Kent Police said he later went back and took the shop's CCTV hard drive, claiming it would help his investigation. In another incident, he seized a second-hand iPhone from a mobile phone shop, telling staff it had been stolen in a burglary before selling it on for £340. Cowan, from Hawkinge in Kent, was arrested after a victim found his name suspicious and reported him to police. When they searched his home, officers found the fake ID badge, evidence bags and cash. He pleaded guilty to six charges of dishonestly making a false representation for gain, and was handed five consecutive 12-month prison terms and a six-month concurrent sentence at Canterbury Crown Court.

Speaking to the House of Lords' EU external affairs sub-committee, Sir John even cast doubt on whether Brexit will proceed. He told peers that ""Brexit - assuming it goes ahead - will have an impact"" on the UK's participation in co-ordinated foreign policy action against countries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea and terror groups such as Islamic State. Calling for more funding for security services once outside the EU, Sir John said: ""It will be vital that we sustain, in many ways enhance, our investments in diplomacy, defence, intelligence - very high investments are made already - if we want to have an influence in the world of the sort we have had over the last 30 or 40 years."" But Sir John, now chairman of consultancy firm Macro Advisory Partners, acknowledged the Government might be able to negotiate a Brexit deal to avoid economic harm. ""We would have to take specific actions through the negotiations and over the years following Brexit in order to recover that position and demonstrate a new dynamism,"" he said. Comparing the situation to the 1970s, Sir John added: ""We managed to turn that round through the '80s, '90s and 2000s - it is possible to do that but it will be a major challenge, a national challenge."" Responding to Sir John's comments, UKIP's security and terrorism spokesman Richard Bingley said: ""I agree with Sir John in that UK national security spending needs to significantly rise. But this is not because of Brexit.""It is because successive UK Governments have cut the police and armed forces to record low numbers, failed to control our borders, failed to jail thousands of extremists, failed to withdraw from European Court of Human Rights and failed to deter and degrade Islamic State and al Qaeda terrorism at our front door."""

""The other concern is that spring tides combined with large waves may lead to overtopping along southernmost coasts,"" she said. ""The low pressure system will then migrate northwards on Sunday taking the stronger winds with it."" This weekend's storm has been named Brian by Met Éireann. Storms in the UK and Ireland are named alphabetically and Brian will follow September's Storm Aileen.

The focus on app security comes as Google launches its new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones, which run on Android. Google has been criticised for what has been seen as the poor security moderation of its Play Store. Research by security company Check Point suggested that Google's automated system failed to detect 50 malware apps which were downloaded up to 4.2 million times before being removed. Malware does not only affect the Play Store, but due to how open the Android operating system is compared to Apple's iOS - which is tightly controlled by its makers in Cupertino, California - it has been detected more often by researchers. According to Symantec, Apple's tight vetting of apps on its store, as well as Android's much larger market share, may be to blame. Malware apps won't be uncovered by the Play Store bug bounty programme however, which will focus on keeping the most popular apps which opt into it secure. Based in Mountain View, California, Google has partnered with the popular bug bounty platform HackerOne to reward those who find, disclose, and help fix the most serious security flaws. Only eight developers have opted into the programme so far, including Tinder, Snapchat, and Dropbox. Google also runs reward programmes for hackers who find vulnerabilities in its Chrome web browser, which currently offers security researchers $100,000 (£75,900) as its top reward."
2017-10-20,Is one of Britain's largest companies preparing to break itself in two?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/durex-splits-from-brasso-and-cillit-bang-in-group-shake-up-at-rb-11086813,"That is the conclusion from the news that consumer goods giant RB, formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, is reorganising itself into two divisions. One division, RB Health, takes in heathcare brands including Neurofen, Strepsils, Gaviscon, Clearasil and Dettol, as well as 'lifestyle' brands such as Durex, Scholl and Veet. The second, RB Hygiene Home, will own household products brands such as Air Wick, Finish, Calgon, Mr Sheen, Vanish, Brasso and Cillit Bang. This is a big shake-up for the UK's 13th-largest company, which was formed by the 1999 merger between British firm Reckitt & Colman with the Dutch company Benckiser. With a stock market value of just under £50bn, RB is a vast business that, during the last decade or so, has made a number of shrewd acquisitions of assets that it successfully identified as having good growth prospects - then managed them more aggressively than their existing owners. These included the old Boots Healthcare business in 2005, which brought in Strepsils and Neurofen; the 2008 acquisition of Adams Healthcare, which brought in Mucinex and the 2010 takeover of SSL, which added Scholl and Durex. The biggest roll of the dice came when, earlier this year, RB announced it was splashing out $16.7bn for the US baby milk maker Mead Johnson. Some businesses have been offloaded along the way, including the famous Colman's mustard brand, but most notably Indivior, a provider of opioids to people seeking to lose their heroin addiction, which was floated off in 2014. Following the Mead Johnson deal, RB also announced plans to sell its remaining food brands, including the French's mustard business. Announcing the move, RB said: ""The two business units will together form one RB - a single company devoted to delivering on our mission of creating healthier lives and happier homes."" Yet this separation of the two businesses will inevitably lead to speculation RB plans to float off its Hygiene Home arm which, accounting for 40% of sales, is the smaller of the two divisions. Adding fuel to this is that Rakesh Kapoor, RB's chief executive, will be personally heading RB Health. There is a logic to the reorganisation. Along with other consumer goods giants like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, RB is wrestling both with changing consumer habits and tastes, including disruption from internet start-ups that sell direct to the consumer and competition from supermarket own brands. All at a time when the rising price of commodities like palm oil, a key ingredient, are rising. A more formal break-up would undoubtedly be welcomed. Investors have started to fret that sales growth has stalled at RB - concerns accentuated today when RB admitted that, during the three months to the end of September, sales were down 1% on the same period on a like-for-like basis. Analysts had been expecting growth during the quarter. Adding to those worries have been a string of setbacks, including a cyberattack in June this year and an earlier scandal in South Korea involving the sale of a humidifier disinfectant linked to the deaths of more than 100 people. This has got some shareholders worrying that, given RB's well-known efficiency, whether it has been 'running too hot' or, at the very least, whether it can carry on growing profits further in a climate in which sales growth is flagging and in which it has few obvious cost cuts left to make. Adding to that unease was the sudden departure, last month, of four of the 10 members of RB's executive committee. Demerging Hygiene Home would also fit with what is thought to be Mr Kapoor's long-held ambition of turning RB into a pure consumer healthcare giant. Mead Johnson was an obvious step in bulking up in that area and there are other assets likely to be up for sale in the near future, most notably the consumer healthcare divisions of Pfizer, which includes the Advil, Centrum and Chapstick brands. Merck, another pharma giant, is also thought to be mulling the sale of its consumer healthcare arm, which makes Seven Seas vitamins and Sangobion, the iron supplement. Mr Kapoor insisted today it was too soon to say if RB will bid for either, but is known to be keen. He said integrating either would not be a concern. But RB will not have the field to itself. Nestle has also expressed an interest in bulking up in consumer healthcare, reasoning that, like RB, it is probably better-placed to distribute and sell such products than the big drug companies, which in most - but not all - cases are seeking to focus on their science and on their more profitable pharmaceutical products. It promises to be an interesting 18 months or so in the sector."

""This will include a ban from attending future Everton fixtures and the Club registering a formal complaint with Merseyside Police."" The incident happened in the 63rd minute of Thursday's Europa League match after Everton's Ashley Williams barged into Lyon keeper Anthony Lopes. Players from both sides ran into the melee as the pushing and shoving ended up directly in front of the stands. A man in a tracksuit, holding a child with one arm, can be seen in TV pictures striding to the front before apparently throwing a punch at Lopes. The man continues to shout and gesture angrily as Lyon players confront him. Several other men from the crowd were also involved in the disturbance, with one grabbing the arm of Lyon's Lucas Tousart. Merseyside Police said: ""Detectives will be reviewing footage and speaking to witnesses to establish what, if any, offences have been committed."" Williams, Everton's captain for the night, was booked, as was Lyon's Bertrand Traore, but European football bosses could also review the skirmish and take action. ""Ashley Williams and Everton will surely face further sanction from UEFA once video evidence is studied,"" former Premier League referee Graham Poll told the Daily Mail. ""Williams totally lost the plot. ""There were numerous players from both teams involved... and even a fan from the Everton section at the Gwladys Street End became involved - first pushing then appearing to aim a punch at a Lyon player."" He added: ""The UEFA delegate and referee's observer will have met with the official after the game and discussed their findings before submitting individual reports. ""Unless the referee ill-advisedly says he saw everything, sanctions really must follow."" Speaking after Everton's 2-1 home defeat, Williams told BT Sport: ""It's what happens, it's football. It is what it is. ""It's high emotions. We want to win the game, they want to win the game and stuff happens. That was just one of those times."""
2017-10-20,Chancellor Philip Hammond has received a boost ahead of next month's Budget as public sector borrowing in September fell to its lowest in 10 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/boost-for-chancellor-as-september-borrowing-lowest-for-ten-years-11089314,"The borrowing figure of £5.9bn - which excludes the impact of bank bail-outs - was 11%, or £700m, lower than the same month last year - and beat the £6.5bn reading expected by economists. It was the lowest monthly deficit for September since 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) marked the third month in which public finances have performed better than expected - and also saw the deficit for August revised down by about £1bn to £4.7bn. It means that for the financial year to date, borrowing is running at £32.5bn, 7% lower than at the same stage a year ago. That suggests the Chancellor looks well placed to beat the performance forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which has pencilled in a 28% rise in borrowing for the financial year to the end of March. The September data showed an uptick in income tax receipts on the same month last year but a slight fall in corporation tax revenues. :: Productivity decline is headache for Hammond The UK's debt mountain stood at £1.785tn, a rise of £145bn on last year. Interest payments on the debt in September climbed by £400m compared to last year, to £3.7bn - thanks to the rise in inflation, because about a third of Government bonds are linked to the inflation rate. October's public finance figures will be published on 21 November, a day before the Budget. Mr Hammond is under pressure both from Labour and some in his own Conservative party to loosen the purse strings on spending, with public sector pay restraint in particular focus. However he was dealt a blow earlier this month when the OBR said it was likely to cut the outlook for productivity growth, which may suggest slower economic expansion, and tax revenues, in the future. Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that if borrowing maintained its trend for the rest of the fiscal year, it would be on course to come in about £16bn below the OBR's forecast. But he said it was ""too soon for the Chancellor to begin loosening the purse strings in response"" as negative factors affecting the public finances were expected to be loaded towards the latter half of the year. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the fall in borrowing continued to reflect the Government pushing through spending cuts, rather than surging tax receipts. He added that Mr Hammond looked unlikely to loosen spending restraints now. ""The Chancellor likely will retain scope to ease the fiscal consolidation in the event of a damaging hard Brexit, rather than ease policy now,"" Mr Tombs said. The Treasury said: ""Whilst we've made great progress getting the deficit down by over two thirds, government borrowing is still far too high at over £150m a day. ""We will continue to take a balanced approach that deals with our debts and allows us to invest in our public services."""

Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, who is accused of inflicting those injuries on the 18-month-old girl, had formally adopted her with his husband Craig Scully-Hicks, 36, just two weeks before she was taken to hospital on 25 May last year. Cardiff Crown Court heard Scully-Hicks, who denies murder, dialled 999 at around 6.20pm saying Elsie had gone all ""floppy and limp"" and was not breathing. Audio recordings and a transcript of the 999 call were released by the Crown Prosecution Service on Friday. A previous call to emergency services after Elsie allegedly fell down the stairs in March 2016 was also made public. In the recordings, heard by the jury last week, Scully-Hicks can be heard following instructions to administer CPR to his daughter, saying ""oh my God"". Elsie was taken from the couple's home in Llandaff, Cardiff, to University Hospital of Wales but died in the early hours of 29 May, 2016. Dr Richard Bonshek, a consultant opthalmic pathologist who examined Elsie's eyes after she died, told the court he found bleeding in both her retinas and in the tissue around her optic nerves. He said: ""Comparing these changes (in Elsie's eyes) with changes I have seen in other cases... I think that for accidental causes then one is talking of severe motor vehicle accidents, falls from heights (or) in cases when a child has been accidentally propelled down stairs or a child has been thrown down stairs."" Elsie's injuries were so severe that had she survived, she would ""most probably"" have had problems with her sight, he added. Neighbours claimed they heard Scully-Hicks, a part-time fitness instructor, shouting and swearing at Elsie when she cried. But they said they had no concerns for her welfare. The defendant is also accused of describing the little girl, who was removed from her natural mother in November 2014 and went to live with the couple in September 2015, as a ""psycho"" and ""Satan dressed up in a babygro"" in messages. She fractured her right leg in two places in November that year and suffered bruises to her head in December and January 2016. On 10 March, she was taken to hospital after falling down the stairs. Scully-Hicks denies one charge of murder. The trial continues."

The document was published by the Sydney Morning Herald and has been verified by Australia's foreign ministry. :: Nuclear test site may be suffering from 'Tired Mountain Syndrome' Australia's prime minister dismissed it as a ""rant"", while the country's foreign minister said it showed diplomatic pressure from the international community was working. It comes amid rising tensions between North Korea and the US, with Kim Jong Un's regime carrying out a number of ballistic missile and nuclear tests. Mr Trump has threatened to ""totally destroy"" the country if needs be, describing Kim as ""rocket man"" on a suicide mission. Titled ""Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries"", the letter was sent from Pyongyang's embassy in Indonesia to Australia's embassy in the country on 28 September. :: EU to toughen sanctions against North Korea It calls for ""countries loving independence, peace and justice"" to keep ""sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves"" of Mr Trump, who is ""trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster"". Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the letter was sent to ""a lot of other countries"". He told Melbourne radio station 3AW: ""It doesn't actually say anything about Australia so much. It's basically a rant about how bad Donald Trump is. ""I think that they are starting to feel the squeeze and that is because China, to its great credit, notwithstanding the long and very close history with North Korea, is part of the global sanctions including restricting oil exports into North Korea. ""So the tighter the economic sanctions are applied, the greater prospects we have of resolving that situation without a conflict."" :: Trump on North Korea: 'Only one thing will work' Foreign minister Julie Bishop described the missive as an ""unprecedented"" communication. She said: ""It is not the way they usually publish their global messages. ""The collective strategy of imposing maximum diplomatic and economic pressure through sanctions on North Korea is working. This is a response to the pressure."""

OK @theresa_may, this is a test. Will you publicly condemn this outright fearmongering? https://t.co/RVl8bSV7VN Another Labour MP, Yvette Cooper, said: ""It is appalling that we have reached the point where inflammatory and ignorant statements from the President of the United States are now seen as normal."" The US President wrote: ""Just out report: 'United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.' Not good, we must keep America safe!"" He was referring to a report issued by the Office for National Statistics, which said the overall number of offences registered by police forces rose to 5.2m in the 12 months to June - an increase of 13%. The previous year's total was 4.6m. Please tell me again why we're rolling the red carpet out for this imbecile, @theresa_may? https://t.co/EzAI6sC9IN Attempted murders increased by 59%, to 1,147. The London and Manchester terror attacks, during which officers recorded 294 attempted murders, contributed to that figure. But far from focusing on terror offences, the ONS's report is a general look at UK crime, from burglary to fraud. It covers England and Wales only - not the whole of the UK, as Mr Trump stated. Another report, published by the Home Office earlier this week, said police recorded 80,393 offences in which hate was deemed to be a motivating factor in 2016/17. That was up from 62,518 in 2015/16. Ms Cooper tweeted in response to the President's comments: ""Hate crime in UK up 29% - sadly encouraged by ignorant tweets like this. Not good POTUS."" Ms Cooper expanded on her comments in a statement, adding: ""Hate crime in the UK has gone up by almost 30% and rubbish like this tweet from Donald Trump is designed to provoke even more of it. ""If we are to properly tackle hate crime and every other crime, we have to challenge this kind of nonsense."" Hate crime in UK up 29% - sadly encouraged by ignorant tweets like this. Not good POTUS https://t.co/MATvVAz48q Mr Trump has caused controversy before by talking about extremism in Britain. While running for the White House he claimed the UK had a ""massive Muslim problem"". He also alleged that parts of London were ""so radicalised"" that police were ""afraid for their own lives"". David Cameron, who was prime minister at the time, slammed the comments as ""divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong""."

Police Scotland says it is a scoping exercise that has been under way for several months, rather than an investigation, but they are assessing the allegations for criminality. In a statement, the force said: ""Police Scotland can confirm that they have received reports regarding The Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports."" :: RBS to sell stake in Euroclear The bank said: ""RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against RBS. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland or the Crown Office."" RBS admitted last year that it ""could have done better"" for the 12,000 small business customers served by the now-defunct unit, but denies allegations that it tried to profit from their difficulties. Among the things it got wrong were transparency on fees and apparent conflicts of interest. Many of GRG's top managers have left and it has been folded into other parts of the bank and last year, the bank put aside almost £400m to compensate some of those small businesses. Bill Esterson MP, Labour's shadow business and international trade minister, said: ""It is crucial that the truth is discovered as part of a full and transparent process and that trust between businesses and some of the banks is restored.

2017-10-20,Brexit may mean instability for businesses and  EU citizens living here but an unlikely group of people are eagerly awaiting Britain's divorce from Europe. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/illegal-migrants-in-uk-hope-for-post-brexit-amnesty-11088290,"It is estimated that more than a million migrants are living in the UK illegally, according to a former head of Home Office immigration enforcement. But with an expected decline in workers from Europe, the illegal immigrants we spoke to are hoping it could provide an opportunity for some kind of amnesty. Selvarasa Sabesan, 31, told me: ""We believe that we can come up and get an offer from the Government because the European people will go out when Brexit happens so when they go out, the British Government will need people to do the low paid jobs so we believe that they will offer us some opportunity to become legal."" We met Mr Selvarasa and his friend Balasingam Kumaresan, 33, who work illegally in a takeaway shop preparing food and doing odd jobs. The owner of the shop risks heavy fines and even jail for giving work to illegal immigrants. Mr Balasingam said: ""We get pocket money - sometimes £15 to £20 for a full day's work - for one day. ""We get two meals a day given by the shop - chicken. But life very difficult."" We gained a rare insight into the lives of illegal immigrants living in the shadows. Fearful of being arrested and deported, they told us they want to become hard working members of society. But they dare not risk interaction with their local community for fear of someone becoming suspicious and reporting them to the council or the police. We followed the men home from the takeaway at the end of their shift, and found they were living in a garage with a group of Tamils from Sri Lanka. Most of the group sleeping rough here came on fake visas, saying they were fleeing persecution. Some illegal immigrants are no doubt exploited as cheap labour, while others get work through pity. In the EU referendum, immigration was one of the key issues, with some voters wanting open borders with Europe to stop. But the irony is that these immigrants now think Brexit could benefit them. We also met Ashanthan Thiyagarajah, who sleeps in a stock room at the back of a corner shop. He, like many illegal immigrants, came on a student visa which has now expired. He said: ""Asians and other non European people will have the job opportunities because of the Brexit and it's good that the referendum came."""
2017-10-20,"Britain's elite universities represent a ""social apartheid"" as new figures reveal a privileged background is ""still the key"" to earning a place at Oxford or Cambridge, a former Labour minister has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/new-data-reveals-social-apartheid-at-oxford-and-cambridge-universities-11089050,"Data published by David Lammy MP shows successful entrants to the UK's top two universities were dominated by students from the south of England, the top two social classes and of non-black ethnicity. The ex-universities minister branded Oxbridge colleges ""fiefdoms of entrenched privilege"" and demanded greater action to increase diversity over the ""shocking"" figures. The data, secured by Mr Lammy through Freedom of Information requests, reveals: :: The University of Cambridge made more offers to applicants from four of the Home Counties (Hertfordshire, Surrey, Kent and Oxfordshire) than the whole of the North of England between 2010 to 2015. :: Both universities draw half their students from the South East and London, with around 11% from the Midlands and 15% from the North. :: In each year between 2010 to 2015, 13 of the University of Oxford's 38 colleges did not make a single offer to a black A level applicant. :: Less than 1% of Cambridge offers went to Pakistani applicants and 1% to black applicants between 2010 to 2015. :: The proportion of offers that both universities made to applicants from the top two social classes rose from 79% in 2010, to 82% at Oxford and 81% at Cambridge in 2015. Tottenham MP Mr Lammy said: ""Overall, the picture painted by this data is of two institutions that overwhelmingly draw their students from a privileged minority in the South of England."" The former barrister is calling for Oxbridge to end their collegiate admissions system for a centralised process to address shortcomings. He also wants foundation years for those from under-represented sections of society; for the universities to directly contact talented students from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds to encourage them to apply; and to copy the US Ivy League's system of giving weight to an applicant's social class and local authority. Mr Lammy said: ""An Oxbridge degree is still the golden ticket in our society and a gateway to the top jobs so the Government has a responsibility to hold Oxbridge to account."" He claimed it was ""not good enough"" for the universities to blame the school system. In response, the University of Cambridge pointed to its highest ever level of undergraduate acceptances for black and minority ethnic background students (21.8%) in 2016. The university's 2017 figures also show the highest proportion of state-educated students in 35 years. A spokesperson said: ""We aim to widen participation further whilst maintaining high academic standards. ""Our admissions decisions are based on academic considerations alone. We are committed to admitting the best students who will thrive on our courses. ""The greatest barrier to participation at selective universities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds is low attainment at school. ""We assess the achievements of these students in their full context to ensure that students with great academic potential are identified."" The University of Oxford said students from black and minority ethnic backgrounds made up 15.9% of its 2016 undergraduate intake, double the figure in 2010. A spokesperson said solving the problem would be ""a long journey that requires huge, joined-up effort across society - including from leading universities like Oxford - to address serious inequalities""."
2017-10-20,Have you ever wanted to own shares in a debt collection agency? ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/why-the-city-is-showing-a-healthy-appetite-for-floats-11089670,"Well, soon you will have the opportunity to do so, as Cabot Credit Management, the UK's largest, has announced it plans to float on the stock market. The IPO, which is expected to take place some time during November, will value the company - currently owned by the private equity firm JC Flowers and the US debt collection firm Encore Capital - at £1bn. There had been a potential hold up to proceedings as Peter Crook, who had been lined up as chairman, had to step aside after having to resign as chief executive of Provident Financial, the doorstep lender, following a thumping profits warning from the company. Instead, Cabot's chairman will now be Andy Haste, the former chief executive of RSA, the insurer and also currently the chairman of Wonga, the short-term credit provider. Ken Stannard, chief executive of the Kent-based company, said: ""This is a very exciting episode in Cabot's continued growth and development. ""As one of the largest players in Europe, it now feels right to be listing on the London Stock Exchange. We are faced with significant untapped growth potential."" News that Cabot is coming to market - first reported by Sky News - confirms a very positive recent spell for the London stock market. It is one of a number of companies that has recently announced plans for a flotation with others including Footasylum, the Rochdale-based fashion retailer founded 12 years ago by David Makin and John Wardle, the co-founders of JD Sports. Sky News recently revealed that Amsterdam-based TMF - which provides tax, administration and legal services - is also planning to come to market. So, too, is Bakkavor, the largest supplier of ready meals to Britain's supermarkets, and TI Fluid Systems, a car parts supplier. So all of a sudden, these are good times for the bankers and advisers who make a living bringing companies to market. According to the business services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, some £7.36bn was raised in flotations across Europe during the July-September quarter, up from £3.4bn in the same period last year. That, of course, reflects a bounce back from the generally depressed conditions during the third quarter of 2016, when businesses and the City were still trying to work out what the consequences would be of the unexpected Brexit vote. But it is striking nonetheless that, during the third quarter, London accounted for 36% of all new listings in Europe, with 27 companies listing on the London Stock Exchange, raising £2.7bn. That was more than any other European bourse and was London's busiest third quarter since 2011. This confidence can be seen throughout the UK market. The Alternative Investment Market (AIM), where the riskiest new issues tend to be floated, has seen more than £1.7bn raised during the first nine months of the year - up from just £1.1bn for the whole of 2016. The question is why conditions are suddenly quite good for flotations. There appear to be a number of reasons. The first and most obvious is the recent lack of volatility in markets. Conditions have been relatively calm, with few of the large one-day gains or falls that have characterised the post-crisis years. Instead, the FTSE 100 has drifted gently higher - hitting new records on a number of occasions. Other markets elsewhere have also been regularly setting records - pointing to an environment in which investors are clearly happy to commit capital to IPOs. That is an investment climate on which, if you are the owner of a business that you hope some day to float on the stock market, you do not want to miss out on. A second factor is that a backlog of potential flotations had built up following the Brexit vote. Companies were reluctant to come to market in an uncertain environment - particularly when it was not clear when the UK would actually leave the EU - but, with Article 50 now triggered and the UK's exit date set in stone as just under 18 months away, there is a little more certainty around. The risk of Jeremy Corbyn, who is seen as anti-business, in 10 Downing Street might put off some investors but - in theory anyway - there is not due to be another General Election for almost five years. A third factor is the macroeconomic backdrop. Growth has returned to the eurozone and, for companies doing business there, that is supporting earnings growth. The UK economy is also growing at a modest but steady pace. With interest rates still at ultra-low levels around the world, albeit potentially set to start rising gently in the UK, that makes equities an attractive alternative to buying bonds or leaving cash on deposit. Money remains very cheap and there is enough of it sloshing about for investors to feel comfortable committing some of it to new issues. How long these benign conditions remain place is open to question. Some people are concerned that stock market valuations are already stretched and, as we get closer to Brexit, investors will begin to get jittery if the terms of Britain's departure from the EU remain clouded by uncertainty. Moreover, should the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England raise interest rates more rapidly than expected, that could also knock confidence. But, for now, those who are looking to float companies on the stock market and the people who advise them are making hay while the sun shines."
2017-10-20,"Despite domestic abuse being of ""personal importance"" to Theresa May, women fleeing violence are struggling to find a space in a refuge and can end up sleeping rough.

Sky News gained exclusive access to Reigate and Banstead women's refuge in Surrey. The refuge's manager Charlotte Kneer said: ""There are women calling every day needing a space and not being able to find one, and that is as a result of so many refuges closing."" The current levels of refuge provision in England fall nearly 2,000 beds short of the minimum standards stipulated by the Council of Europe. Some victims may have been suffering for a long time. Ms Kneer added: ""They've got the courage to pick the phone up and that could have taken them 10 years or 20 years. ""And the first call that they make, to get a space... and we have to say no, I'm sorry, we're full. ""What really scares me is when we put the phone down to them, are they ever going to pick it up again?"" If suitable accommodation cannot be found, the alternative may be much worse. Women's Aid CEO Katie Ghose told us what happens to women who are turned away. ""Some sleep rough - even pregnant women will sleep rough. Some will be able to stay with friends or family for a short while, but will then find themselves homeless again. ""In the very worst of circumstances, women will actually return to an abusive relationship."" A woman who needed emergency accommodation with her young children told Sky News they were put up in a hostel with male ex-prisoners. ""We didn't have a lock on the front door. The locks on the rooms were very flimsy,"" she said. ""We had shared bathrooms that didn't have locks on. There were male occupants in there who were wearing tags."" In a report it produced this year, Women's Aid spoke to 404 women who were all refused space in a refuge on at least one occasion. For 45% of the women, there had been three or more occasions when there had been no space. Only a quarter were eventually found suitable accommodation. New legislation announced by the Government in June, defining domestic abuse in law, establish a domestic violence commissioner as well as harsher punishment for perpetrators. But while this announcement was welcomed, campaigners say it does little to address historic cuts to services, and that funding for refuges should be ring-fenced to provide a long-term solution. The Department for Communities and Local Government told Sky News: ""We expect local authorities to provide specialist accommodation and services that are appropriate, and reflect the needs of victims and their families. ""We're investing £100m in programmes to tackle violence against women and girls. ""This includes £20m to create more refuge spaces and provide specialist support within safe accommodation for more than 19,000 victims to rebuild their lives."""

Tarantino told the New York Times: ""I knew enough to do more than I did. There was more to it than just normal rumours, the normal gossip. It wasn't second hand. I knew he did a couple of these things."" Although he said he once confronted Weinstein over an allegation, he added: ""I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard."" The Weinstein Company - from which Weinstein has since been fired - has produced all of Tarantino's films since the 1994 hit Pulp Fiction. Their films include Inglourious Basterds, The Hateful Eight and Django Unchained, which is The Weinstein Company's highest-grossing movie. Tarantino said he had tried to telephone Weinstein since the scandal broke but had received no reply. #LAPD Robbery Homicide Div has interviewed a potential sexual assault victim involving Harvey Weinstein in 2013.  Investigation ongoing Meanwhile, detectives from the LAPD robbery homicide division's rape investigation unit are reported to have spent two hours speaking with the alleged victim. More than 40 women have made allegations of harassment or inappropriate behaviour against Weinstein since investigations by the New York Times and New Yorker magazine were published. The mogul has been expelled by both Hollywood's Oscars Academy and the British Film Institute. He is currently at a rehab centre in Arizona. Through his lawyers, he has ""unequivocally"" denied allegations of non-consensual sex made against him. The actresses Rose McGowan and Lysette Anthony are among those who have made allegations of sexual assault. The Los Angeles Times has reported that the latest accuser is an Italian model and actress. She says Weinstein forced his way into her room at a Beverly Hills hotel before dragging her to the bathroom and raping her. She told the newspaper: ""I barely knew this man. It was the most demeaning thing ever done to me by far. It sickens me still. He made me feel like an object, like nothing with all his power.""

2017-10-20,"Parking charges for those picking up and dropping off passengers at some of the UK's busiest airports have been hiked up to ""eye-watering"" levels, a study has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/eye-watering-price-hike-for-collecting-passengers-at-airports-study-11090310,"Eight of the top 20 airports have increased tariffs this year, according to the research by motoring firm RAC, which advised drivers to ""keep goodbyes to a minimum"" as five airports raised fees for dropping off departing passengers. RAC spokesman Simon Williams warned the increased charges will be viewed by drivers as ""another way of making money out of them"". The comments come after fees rose by as much as 100% in the past year while some airports introduced completely new charges. The study found London Luton charged the most for collecting passengers at £7 for 40 minutes, London Stansted followed with £5 for half an hour, and Birmingham came third with £4.90 for one hour. Stansted is the most costly for dropping off passengers at £3.50 for 10 minutes, 50p more than Luton's charge for the same time. Liverpool John Lennon comes third £3 for 20 minutes, although a secondary drop-off point, which requires a five to 10 minutes' walk is free. Mr Williams said: ""The eye-watering drop-off and pick-up costs at some airports is likely to be viewed by drivers as another way of making money out of them, particularly in instances where public transport to and from the airport simply isn't a viable option. ""This year many airports have increased the already sky-high prices they charge for short-stay parking near their departure and arrival terminals making a good deed a costly experience. ""Drop-off charges are the biggest bone of contention as for many they appear severe when they are simply pulling up for less than five minutes and often don't even get out of the car themselves."" Seven airports offer free drop-off parking by terminals. They are: London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London City, Cardiff, Manchester, Belfast City and Jersey. But trade group, the Airport Operators Association, said income from parking supported investment in facilities and ""allows airports to keep charges to airlines low, benefiting travellers through lower air fares"". A spokesman said airports provide clear information about the cost of parking options, ensuring passengers have a ""high level of awareness"" of different ways to get to the airport. He also said drop-off charges helped manage congestion and limit the environmental impact of journeys. :: Cost of collecting passengers based on minimum stay charges (top five most expensive) 1. London Luton - £7 for 40 minutes 2. London Stansted - £5 for 30 minutes (an increase of 50p from 2016) 3. Birmingham - £4.90 for 60 minutes (an increase of 20p from 2016) 4.

He also admitted a charge of handling stolen goods after the painting, titled Cookham from Englefield, was found in his home. The work, by Sir Stanley Spencer, had been stolen from the Stanley Spencer Gallery in Cookham, Berkshire, in 2012. Detectives arrested Fisher on 15 June after they stopped a Mercedes in a residential road in Strood, Kent. Inside they found one kilogram of cocaine and £30,000 in cash. A passenger in the vehicle, 32-year-old Zak Lal, of Strood, Rochester, was arrested and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and acquiring criminal property. He also admitted a charge of possession of an offensive weapon after he was found with a knife when he was arrested. Lal was jailed for five years and eight months at the same hearing on Friday. The home addresses of both men were later searched by police and officers found three kilograms of cocaine and 15,000 ecstasy tablets in Fisher's flat in Kingston. A further quantity of class A drugs and £40,000 in cash was found in a separate search at Fisher's family address in Fulham. The total street value of the drugs was estimated to be £450,000. Detective Inspector Andy Whitewood said: ""These two men were caught in possession of a considerable amount of class A drugs as the result of a proactive investigation targeting high end, organised drug supply. ""A search of Fisher's address revealed a stolen £1m painting, this demonstrates the link between drugs trafficking and serious, acquisitive crime."" A spokesman for the Stanley Spencer Gallery said its volunteers were ""immensely grateful"" for the recovery of the painting."
2017-10-20,Harvey Weinstein has been banned by the Academy and the BFI and suspended from BAFTA - based only on accusations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/does-weinstein-scandal-mask-institutional-problem-11087955,"It is an odd thing, the institutional mentality. At times it is random, imprecise, unfair; what applies to one person seldom applies to all, and there seems to be a blatant indifference to the rule of law. Harvey Weinstein has been accused by more than 40 women of either sexual harassment, sexual assault or even rape - but he has denied the allegations against him and has yet to be charged with any offence. However, the Academy, it seems, felt pressured to react to the dozens of stars who were ""shocked and disgusted"" by his alleged behaviour, and on Sunday announced it was banning the film mogul. The group, which has more than 8,000 members, said the film producer ""does not merit the respect of his colleagues"". :: Hollywood's PR machine and its secret scandal BAFTA was even swifter, making the announcement just five days after the New York Times published its first expose. ""While BAFTA has previously been a beneficiary of Mr Weinstein's support for its charitable work, it considers the reported alleged behaviour completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA's values,"" the organisation said. Without going into the details of legal procedures, where everyone is innocent until proven guilty - yawn, right? - how do the good folks at the British Academy Of Film and Television Arts feel about running a retrospective on Roman Polanski? :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's infamous casting couch In 1978, the French-Polish director admitted the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. Twenty-five years later, he won both best director and best film for The Pianist at the BAFTA awards. He also won best director at the Oscars. Whatever problems these institutions have with the Weinstein claims, they didn't have with Polanski. The British Film Institute was not as quick to condemn Weinstein, but has now withdrawn the fellowship awarded to him in 2002. ""Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" the BFI said in a statement. ""Everyone working in the film industry - in any industry - should be safe and respected in the workplace."" By acting like this, of both judge and jury of accused filmmakers, actors or producers, film institutions risk being dragged into the spotlight by the industry and the media. The most sensible thing to do would be to write up a code of conduct for members to protect actors from casting couch-type situations. The BFI has now promised to do so, incorporating it in its diversity standards. They should wait for court proceedings, if any, to be over to make any sort of decision regarding members - or risk fuelling a lynch mob-like mentality, with subjects trialled by their peers and social media before they are even charged with an offence. Granted, Weinstein could end up facing a jury one day, and I'm certainly not defending him - but we shouldn't be treating him as a criminal either. Not yet, anyway."

With moving poignancy, Berry, whose son William died in a car accident, said: ""If I could have one more minute with William, what would I say? I would thank him. I would thank him for being a brilliant son."" Ferdinand, whose wife Rebecca died in 2015, said: ""I'd definitely ask her about what she wanted with the children growing up, at different stages, poignant moments in their development. Tell her I love her... there's loads."" And television star Jason Watkins, whose two-year-old daughter Maude died in 2011, said: ""I think if I were to have another minute with her I think I'd say I'd remind her of all the wonderful things that she'd given us and all the wonderful things that we did. ""And talk about as much as I could in that minute. All the wonderful feelings she gave us and the joy, and that she won't be forgotten and that she's handed on all her beauty to her sister and to us, and that we'll never forget her."" Every day 111 children in the UK lose a parent. And over 10,000 children and young people die each year. The charity Child Bereavement UK made the One More Minute campaign to highlight the needs of children and families facing bereavement. The charity's CEO, Ann Chalmers, said: ""What we hope is that it will raise awareness of the experience of families. We hope that it's something people will relate to. We hope that if people feel touched by the films they'll be interested in looking at the One More Minute website and finding out more about the charity and its work. And we also hope that people will find a way to access the support that they might need after bereavement."" One of the charity's young ambassadors is Rebecca Gascoigne whose mum died from breast cancer when she was five. She is also filmed in the campaign video and says the charity helped her accept and manage her grief. ""They turned my life around. I started receiving individual counselling and then I progressed onto group projects. But through all that, the charity have showed me my life didn't have to end when my mother's did, and that I have so much to live for and so much to make her proud of. And that, I wouldn't have seen without their help."""

Mr Kelly's comments follow the row between Mr Trump and Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson who says she overheard the president tell the widow of Sergeant La David Johnson who was killed in Niger that ""he knew what he signed up for"". Mr Trump, who denied he had been disrespectful, spoke of his commitment of contacting next of kin and brought Mr Kelly into the controversy by saying he wondered if President Obama had called the former Marine general after his son's death. Mr Kelly said he was ""broken-hearted"" that troops who died on the battlefield were being politicised. In an unannounced statement on a podium at the White House, Mr Kelly explained how Mr Trump had sought his advice on contacting the families of fallen heroes. Mr Kelly said: ""There's no perfect way to make that phone call. When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it my first recommendation was he not do it because it's not the phone call parents, family members are looking forward to. ""He asked about previous presidents. I said, I can tell you that President Obama, who was my commander-in-chief when I was on active duty, did not call my family. That was not a criticism that was just to say I don't believe President Obama called."" But when Mr Trump indicated he wanted to contact families, Mr Kelly revealed to him what General Joseph Dunford, now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told him when his son was killed. Mr Kelly recalled that Mr Dunford said his son ""was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed"". ""He knew what he was getting into. He knew what the possibilities were because we're at war."" Mr Kelly added that Mr Dunford told him that ""when he died, he was surrounded by the best men on this Earth, his friends"". ""That's what the president tried to say to four families the other day,"" he said. Rounding on Frederica Wilson, he went on: ""It stuns me that a member of Congress listened into that conversation, it stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred."" Robert Kelly, 29, was killed when he stepped on a land mine in Afghanistan's Helmand province. Mr Kelly said that his family got calls from Robert's friends in Afghanistan attesting to his character. Mr Trump has also been criticised after a father of a fallen soldier claimed the president had offered him $25,000 after the death of his son but the cheque never arrived."

It is a higher proportion than in many other European countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. Of the western European countries included in the study, only Belgium recorded a higher rate of 8.59%. However, Belgium has a higher population density than the UK. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: ""Air pollution is reaching crisis point worldwide, and the UK is faring worse than many countries in western Europe and the US. ""A contributing factor could be our dependence on diesel vehicles, notorious for pumping out a higher amount of poisonous particles and gases."" Scientists on the Lancet Commission on Pollution spent two years analysing 2015 data from the Global Burden of Disease, a huge inquiry into the leading causes of death and illness worldwide, to reach their findings. In the US, more than 155,000 people were killed by pollution, they said - 5.74% of the country's total deaths. The study attributed an estimated 9m premature deaths worldwide to pollution in 2015, with 6.5m people dying from air pollution, principally caused by road traffic and industrial emissions. Infectious diseases resulting from contaminated water supplies and sanitation caused 1.8m deaths. Heart disease, stroke and lung cancer are among the most common symptoms of death from pollution, most often caused by chemicals in the air. Professor Philip Landrigan, from the Icahn School of Medicine in New York, who co-led the investigation, called pollution a ""profound and pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health and wellbeing"". Regions experiencing rapid development and industrialisation suffered most, with around 2.5m people in India killed by pollution in 2015 and 1.8m in China, researchers say. Pakistan, Bangladesh, Madagascar and Kenya are among other badly affected countries. While historical pollutants such as lead and asbestos still pose a threat, the study warned of the dangers posed by newer synthetic chemicals that have entered world markets in the past two decades. These include developmental neurotoxicants, chemical herbicides and pharmaceutical wastes, the researchers said."
2017-10-20,"A former chief executive of Ofcom, the media regulator, is being drafted in by Uber to aid its appeal against a ban that could force it to pull out of London.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/uber-hails-ex-ofcom-chief-to-help-drive-london-licence-appeal-11089644,"Sky News has learnt that Flint Global, a consulting firm jointly founded by Ed Richards, who ran Ofcom until 2014, is in discussions with Uber about undertaking advisory work for the ride-hailing app. The emergence of Flint Global's involvement comes a week after Uber formally lodged its legal appeal against Transport for London's (TfL) ruling that the company was not a ""fit and proper"" holder of a private-hire licence in the capital. Mr Richards set up Flint Global last year with Sir Simon Fraser, the former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, and it promotes itself as helping ""firms on the issues they encounter at the interface with government and regulators"". Its work with Uber forms part of the transport company's efforts to reposition itself as a responsible operator, despite opposition from licensed taxi drivers' representatives and a number of other powerful lobbying groups. Uber's new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, travelled to London two weeks ago for talks with TfL, with both sides describing their discussion as ""constructive"". The first hearing in the appeal process, which is likely to stretch well into 2018, is scheduled to be held in December. Last month, Sky News revealed that Uber had hired headhunters to recruit a heavyweight British business figure to chair its UK operations. Plans for the appointment were drawn up prior to the confirmation that TfL would not renew Uber's licence to operate in the capital, although the search has now become more urgent. The ban on Uber has sparked a furious backlash from Londoners, with more than 700,000 people signing a petition to allow the company to keep operating despite its failure to report a string of criminal offences perpetrated by its drivers. Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor who chairs the TfL board, has sought to defend the decision - arguing that Uber has not demonstrated that it can ""play by the rules"". Uber now has about 40,000 drivers in London‎, and is used by about 3.5 million customers, but its rise has sparked the most significant backlash to date against a major champion of the ""gig economy"". Losing its ability to operate in London could threaten its ability to preserve its licences in other cities around the world, where it has also come under intense regulatory pressure. In turn, that would affect Uber's chances of attaining a premium valuation in a public flotation that Mr Khosrowshahi has indicated is likely within 18 months. Since TfL's decision to ban the company, a number of senior executives including Jo Bertram, Uber's northern Europe chief, and European head of policy Christopher Burghardt have resigned. Uber and Flint Global both declined to comment."

It came minutes before Theresa May said she was ""ambitious and positive"" about negotiations - but added that there is still ""some way to go"". The Prime Minister said there were only ""small issues"" on citizens' rights left to resolve and insisted the key ""sufficient progress"" demand made by the EU to trigger phase-two talks was ""within touching distance"". She added the EU did ""not need to be concerned"" about its budget plan, which the UK signed up to until 2020. ""We will be going line by line through those commitments,"" she said. :: Ex-MI6 chief suggests Brexit may not happen:: PM's offer to EU citizens ahead of crunch summit While Mr Tusk announced the start of internal talks among EU members, the EU27 have formally delayed a decision on progressing talks with the UK until another summit in December. ""Against this background, the European Council invites the Council (Art. 50) together with the Union negotiator to start internal preparatory discussions,"" a document released on Friday said. Brexit secretary David Davis said work on the transition and future relationship was in the EU members states' interest. He said: ""The reason they're doing this is their own interest. There's 300 billion of trade with us and that's what they want to preserve, as well, of course, as the interests of their citizens and the interests of the union. ""What we have said very plainly is that we will meet our commitments, the commitments we entered into in good faith, and nobody will lose either by paying more or receiving less in this budget round. That's how it will resolve itself."" Labour MP Heidi Alexander likened Mrs May to ""a teenager trying to get away with handing in their homework late"". ""It is nauseating to see ministers who told us that Brexit would be easy now trying to spin this failed summit as a success,"" she said. ""To have not made sufficient progress in negotiations 16 months after the referendum is an unambiguous failure."" After Mrs May left the summit, Mr Tusk used a press conference to talk up her positive performance. He said their discussions were about ""rebooting the atmosphere of trust and good will"", adding: ""I think we succeeded."" ""My impression is that the reports of the deadlock between the UK and the EU have been exaggerated."" The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week said: ""We are at a state of deadlock... which is very disturbing."""

The 40-year-old was among several inmates involved in an ongoing lawsuit arguing the state's use of midazolam during lethal injections is inhumane and not reliable. He was convicted of killing Anderson Gordon, an officer with Montgomery Police, in 1997. A witness had testified that McNabb walked up to Gordon's patrol car and shot him five times. The officer had just arrived at the scene of a traffic accident caused by McNabb as he tried to escape from a bail bondsman. Midazolam is administered to sedate the prisoner, before a second drug paralyses them and a final third drug stops their heart. During an execution in December, an Alabama inmate had coughed and heaved for 13 minutes before dying. McNabb appeared to be breathing for the first 20 minutes of the 35-minute execution. He later moved his head, raised his arms and grimaced after two consciousness checks in which a guard pinched his arm, said his name and pulled back his eyelid. One of his relatives said ""he's going to wake up"" before McNabb eventually became still. Alabama Commissioner Jeff Dunn said McNabb's movements after the second consciousness check were involuntary and that he was not awake. The state said the lawsuit is unlikely to be successful since the US Supreme Court allowed other executions, in Alabama and other states, to go ahead using midazolam. In April, Arkansas executed four inmates in eight days in a bid to use up its supply of midazolam before it expired. It had planned to execute eight prisoners over 11 days, but courts issued stays for the other four inmates."

A spokesperson for Celicourt Communications, which represents the company, told Sky News: ""Ocean Infinity are not yet able to confirm the final award of a contract to help in the search for MH370, but good progress has been made. ""We remain optimistic that we will be able to try and help provide some answers to those who have been affected by this tragedy."" A fruitless search co-ordinated by Australia, China and Malaysia, which cost AUS$200m (£119m), was halted in January. Relatives of those on board and some experts say it was stopped too soon. Families were given fresh hope that some of their questions may be answered when Malaysia said earlier this week that it had begun negotiations with Ocean Infinity about a new search. Australian transport minister Darren Chester said in a statement that the Malaysian government has entered into a ""no find-no fee"" arrangement - although this has not yet been confirmed by Malaysia. ""Malaysia's decision to proceed with the search shows the commitment to find MH370,"" Mr Chester said. ""While I am hopeful of a successful search, I'm conscious of not raising hopes for the loved ones of those on board. ""Ocean Infinity will focus on searching the seafloor in an area that has previously been identified by experts as the next most likely location to find MH370. ""Australia, at Malaysia's request, will provide technical assistance to the Malaysian government and Ocean Infinity. ""No new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft, however data collected during the previous search will be provided."" Malaysia's deputy transport minister Aziz Kaprawi said on Thursday: ""Yes, we are negotiating with Ocean Infinity, but the agreement has not been finalised."" No sign of the plane was found in the 46,000 square mile (120,000sq km) search zone west of Australia identified by satellite analysis as being the most likely location of the wreckage. In July 2015 part of the plane's wing was found on Reunion Island, a French territory in the Indian Ocean, and so far more than 20 objects either confirmed or believed to be from the jet have washed ashore on beaches in Mauritius, Mozambique, Madagascar and Tanzania. But while the debris confirms the plane went down in the Indian Ocean, the location of the main wreckage and what happened to MH370 remain a mystery. A number of theories have been put forward, including a fire on board, a hijacking or terror plot, rogue pilot action and mechanical or structural failure. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau concluded earlier this year that the flight was likely out of control when it hit the ocean, with its wing flaps not prepared for landing."

Officers from Suffolk Constabulary have confirmed they will continue searching for the 23-year-old at the Milton landfill site from Monday. The extended search, expected to take four to six weeks, will focus on an area of Cell 22 next to the site of the earlier search. Police say this is the next most likely area where they could find Mr McKeague, who was last seen on CCTV last year holding a fast food container as he walked through the centre of Bury St Edmunds after a night out, before falling asleep in a shop doorway. Detectives believed Mr McKeague could have been taken away in a rubbish truck after falling into a bin but police ended the initial five-month search of the landfill site in July after no evidence of his body was found. However, a police spokesman said: ""Careful re-checking of the data available to the Major Investigation Team has concluded the area of the original 20-week search is still the location where there was the highest likelihood of finding Corrie. ""However, the nature of waste disposal and its movement is not a precise science, hence the requirement to extend the search."" :: Police release CCTV images in bid to find missing RAF gunner  Mr McKeague, who was stationed at RAF Honington in Suffolk, was last seen on September 24, 2016. His mother Nicola Urquhart spoke to Sky News last month, following the one-year anniversary of her son's disappearance. She said: ""I never imagined we would be here one year later - I can't actually believe it's a year, it has just gone past in a blur. ""It's difficult but I feel like we are doing things that are constructive and proactive to try to assist the investigation. ""There is still so much more that can be done and is getting done by the police and we'll just keep trying to help them. That's how we're coping."""
2017-10-20,"Loyal mobile phone customers could be being charged for their handsets after they have paid them off, a consumer group has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171021045741/http://news.sky.com/story/mobile-customers-still-being-charged-for-handsets-they-have-already-paid-for-consumer-group-warns-11088684,"Citizens Advice says Vodafone, Three and EE, three of the biggest mobile companies in the UK, are failing to reduce bills once phones bought under fixed-term contracts - which usually last for 12, 18 or 24 months - have been paid for. It alleges people with Vodafone contracts are paying up to £38 a month for handsets, with EE and Three charging up to £34 a month, on top of charges for data, calls and texts. The consumer group says customers are being penalised for loyalty and has called on industry regulator Ofcom to step in unless operators raise their game and make billing more transparent Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""It is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for. ""Phone providers must now make sure that any customers staying in a contract past the end of a fixed deal have their monthly bill reduced to reflect the cost of the handset. ""Providers could make it much easier for consumers to compare prices by separating out the cost of handsets from the cost of services like data and minutes for all contracts, that way it would be much clearer what they're paying for."" Once a contract has ended, customers have a choice of remaining with the same operator on the same contract, taking out a new deal or switching to another provider at the end of their fixed-term. Citizens Advice's research found the over-65s were most likely to be caught out by the billing issue, with 23% of such customers on a handset-inclusive deal remaining on it for more than 12 months past the end of the fixed contract. Telecoms regulator Ofcom said: ""We share Citizens Advice's concern that some mobile customers who purchase a handset bundled with their service plan continue to pay the full monthly charge after their minimum contract term ends. ""We're already considering this issue as part of a wider project to help people shop around and secure the right deals."" The Government responded to the report by supporting the charity's recommendations, while mobile operators insisted nothing was being hidden. EE said: ""Separating phone and tariff doesn't always represent the best deal for consumers. ""It can sometimes result in them paying more, and EE customers have the flexibility to choose the tariff and upfront phone cost that's right for them. ""We send our customers regular updates about their options before and after they reach the end of their contract, and the vast majority of our customers upgrade to a new phone or move to a SIM-only plan near the end of theircontract."" Three said the terms of its contracts were always clear and customers were urged to get in touch if they wanted to change their plan at the end of the fixed term. A Vodafone UK spokeswoman said: ""Wherever possible, we contact customers nearing the end of their contract to offer them a range of options."" Liz Wynn, Sky's Director of Mobile, said: ""When we launched Sky Mobile we wanted to shake up the sector with a fair and flexible approach, and the concerns raised by Citizens Advice is one of the key issues we wanted to tackle. ""That's why, with our Swap proposition, we don't overcharge for handsets and offer customers an automatic discount on their monthly cost as soon as their handset is paid for if they choose to keep it. We believe this transparency should be the norm for the UK mobile industry."""

Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, has now written to Philip Hammond asking for evidence that enough is being done to encourage gender and ethnic diversity in recruitment. The committee said it was ""concerned about the composition of the policy committees, and in particular about diversity at the most senior levels in the Bank of England"". The MP said: ""The Treasury must make all efforts to encourage as diverse range of candidates for the Bank's policy committees as possible."" She added that the Treasury had been asked for specific confirmation that its recruitment processes follow the wider remit for public appointments to achieve greater diversity, including ethnic minorities. The letter requests that the department publishes recent historical data, including a gender breakdown of applicants vying for membership of the MPC or the Financial Policy Committee. The committee has approved the appointment of the Bank of England's new deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and new external MPC member Silvana Tenreyro - now the rate-setting committee's only female member after the recent departures of two other women from the body. But Ms Morgan said that, in future, MPs expect to be provided prior to appointment hearings ""with diversity data on the candidates applying to the associated position"". She added the select committee ""would be interested in taking evidence"" from the Chancellor or the ""most appropriate minister or senior official"" on the issue. Earlier this week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney admitted that the lack of women in senior positions was ""an issue"" for the Bank and that it had taken extensive action to correct this. The Treasury said: ""Our recruitment process is fair and open for senior appointments to the Bank of England, but we recognise there is still more to do to improve diversity."""

OK @theresa_may, this is a test. Will you publicly condemn this outright fearmongering? https://t.co/RVl8bSV7VN Another Labour MP, Yvette Cooper, said: ""It is appalling that we have reached the point where inflammatory and ignorant statements from the President of the United States are now seen as normal."" The US President wrote: ""Just out report: 'United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.' Not good, we must keep America safe!"" He was referring to a report issued by the Office for National Statistics, which said the overall number of offences registered by police forces rose to 5.2m in the 12 months to June - an increase of 13%.

The London and Manchester terror attacks, during which officers recorded 294 attempted murders, contributed to that figure.

Another report, published by the Home Office earlier this week, said police recorded 80,393 offences in which hate was deemed to be a motivating factor in 2016/17. That was up from 62,518 in 2015/16.

Police Scotland says it is a scoping exercise that has been under way for several months, rather than an investigation, but they are assessing the allegations for criminality. In a statement, the force said: ""Police Scotland can confirm that they have received reports regarding The Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports."" :: RBS to sell stake in Euroclear The bank said: ""RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against RBS. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland or the Crown Office."" RBS admitted last year that it ""could have done better"" for the 12,000 small business customers served by the now-defunct unit, but denies allegations that it tried to profit from their difficulties. Among the things it got wrong were transparency on fees and apparent conflicts of interest. Many of GRG's top managers have left and it has been folded into other parts of the bank and last year, the bank put aside almost £400m to compensate some of those small businesses. Bill Esterson MP, Labour's shadow business and international trade minister, said: ""It is crucial that the truth is discovered as part of a full and transparent process and that trust between businesses and some of the banks is restored.

He said removing powers from Catalonia was the ""worst attack against the institutions and the people of Catalonia since the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco"". He added: ""I ask the parliament to meet in a plenary session during which we, the representatives of the citizens' sovereignty, will be able to decide over this attempt to liquidate our government and our democracy and act in consequence."" Mr Rajoy said he wants the senate to give him permission to dissolve the regional government in Barcelona and call early elections. He announced the measures to take over the regional cabinet's functions after a crisis meeting of his own cabinet in the wake of the 1 October independence referendum deemed illegal by Madrid. Under his plans, the powers of Catalan officials would be transferred to the Spanish government - but he stressed he did not want to use them to rule Catalonia directly. About 90% of Catalans who voted in the referendum backed breaking away from Spain, but only 40% of eligible voters cast a ballot, with many pro-union supporters declining to vote. The PM's move, aimed at blocking the independence movement, has sparked anger among separatists. Carme Forcade, the speaker of the Catalan parliament, said the move by Madrid was a ""coup and an ""attack on democracy"". She went on: ""Prime Minister Rajoy wants the parliament of Catalonia to stop being a democratic parliament, and we will not allow this to happen. ""This is why we want to send to the citizens of this country a message of firmness and hope. We commit today, after the most serious attack against the Catalan institutions since they were restored, to the defence of the sovereignty of the parliament of Catalonia."" On the streets of Barcelona, people banged pots and pans and drivers beeped their horns. By Saturday evening tens of thousands of people had turned out on the streets to demonstrate. There have been no reports of violence. Catalonia's administration currently runs its own policing, education and healthcare. Mr Rajoy said he was concerned about the financial impact if Catalonia broke away, and claimed the latest figures on the economy were ""worrying"". A number of companies have already announced plans to move some or all of their operations out of the northeast region. Article 155 allows central authorities to intervene when one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions fails to comply with the law. Autonomy is a hugely sensitive issue in Catalonia, which saw its powers taken away under Spain's military dictatorship. Home to 7.5 million people, the region fiercely defends its own language and culture. Meanwhile, King Felipe has said Catalonia ""is and will remain an essential part of 21st century Spain"". In an unusually emotional speech at a prize-giving ceremony, he said the Spanish government would resolve the fight over Catalonia's bid for independence through ""legitimate democratic institutions""."
2017-10-21,"He was one of four jihadists that the UK placed on a UN sanctions list, now the only trace of Abu Sa'eed al Britani is his name on a prison wall in an Islamic State death camp. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171022112550/http://news.sky.com/story/notorious-british-jihadist-abu-saeed-al-britani-may-have-perished-in-is-death-camp-11090767,"It is evidence he fell foul of the violent group he once glorified. Born in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, Abu Sa'eed al Britani was originally called Omar Hussain. He worked as a supermarket security man for Asda and Morrisons. He left the UK for Syria in 2014. Once there, he used social media to encourage others to join IS for both combat and operational roles to create the ""next generation"" of fighters. :: Inside Islamic State's prison of death in fallen Raqqa In August 2014 he told British media outlets he would only return to the UK to ""plant a bomb"". However, the strict discipline of IS in Raqqa didn't seem to suit him. In blogs he complained about his fellow jihadists and said he missed his mother's cooking. Perhaps it was decided he wasn't portraying the right image of Islamic State. Sky News discovered a network of rooms and corridors underneath the Raqqa city sports stadium. It was a place of torture and execution for Islamic State. Abu Sa'eed al Britani's name is scratched on the wall in black pen. Digits marked beneath his name indicate he spent 49 days in the cell. Prisoners who wrote on the walls here were unlikely to leave alive. Of the other three on the UN sanctions list it was reported this month that Sally Jones, the so-called White Widow, was killed in a US drone attack on the Iraq-Syria border. The former punk rocker used her Twitter account to recruit women to IS, and provided practical advice on how to travel to Syria. Her husband was killed in a US drone strike on 24 August 2015. Junaid Hussain was the terror group's chief of digital jihad and planned terror plots against the West. It seems that Jones too may have become disillusioned with IS before she was killed. Sky News reported earlier this year how she was seen crying that she wanted to come back to the UK. The third on the list was Aqsa Mahmood. She travelled from Scotland through Turkey to Aleppo, and was believed to be working with the al Khanssaa brigade, which enforces Sharia law. She has also reportedly worked to encourage terrorist acts via Twitter under the name Umm Layth. Her parents felt ""destroyed"" to discover she had been persuaded to join the terror group through secret text messages from a fanatic. She has been banned from returning to UK and her whereabouts are unknown. Finally Nasser Muthana was a medical student from Cardiff who went to Syria in 2013. He appeared in IS recruitment videos online. His father Ahmed Muthana told Sky News he believed Nasser was radicalised in a mosque in the UK. His father later disowned him after he appeared in an ISIS beheading video in November 2014. In 2015 there were reports he'd been killed. These were later refuted by experts. His location is unknown. It is understood at least 850 fighters have travelled to Syria and Iraq in recent years. About half have returned, many have been killed and many others we just don't know. For Abu Sa'eed al Britani - he joined a pack of killers - it seems his reward may have been to be killed by them. It's possible he survived but more likely he is now just a name on a wall."
2017-10-21,Harvey Weinstein has been banned by the Academy and the BFI and suspended from BAFTA - based only on accusations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171022112550/http://news.sky.com/story/does-weinstein-scandal-mask-institutional-problem-11087955,"It is an odd thing, the institutional mentality. At times it is random, imprecise, unfair; what applies to one person seldom applies to all, and there seems to be a blatant indifference to the rule of law. Harvey Weinstein has been accused by more than 40 women of either sexual harassment, sexual assault or even rape - but he has denied the allegations against him and has yet to be charged with any offence. However, the Academy, it seems, felt pressured to react to the dozens of stars who were ""shocked and disgusted"" by his alleged behaviour, and on Sunday announced it was banning the film mogul. The group, which has more than 8,000 members, said the film producer ""does not merit the respect of his colleagues"". :: Hollywood's PR machine and its secret scandal BAFTA was even swifter, making the announcement just five days after the New York Times published its first expose. ""While BAFTA has previously been a beneficiary of Mr Weinstein's support for its charitable work, it considers the reported alleged behaviour completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA's values,"" the organisation said. Without going into the details of legal procedures, where everyone is innocent until proven guilty - yawn, right? - how do the good folks at the British Academy Of Film and Television Arts feel about running a retrospective on Roman Polanski? :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's infamous casting couch In 1978, the French-Polish director admitted the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. Twenty-five years later, he won both best director and best film for The Pianist at the BAFTA awards. He also won best director at the Oscars. Whatever problems these institutions have with the Weinstein claims, they didn't have with Polanski. The British Film Institute was not as quick to condemn Weinstein, but has now withdrawn the fellowship awarded to him in 2002. ""Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" the BFI said in a statement. ""Everyone working in the film industry - in any industry - should be safe and respected in the workplace."" By acting like this, of both judge and jury of accused filmmakers, actors or producers, film institutions risk being dragged into the spotlight by the industry and the media. The most sensible thing to do would be to write up a code of conduct for members to protect actors from casting couch-type situations. The BFI has now promised to do so, incorporating it in its diversity standards. They should wait for court proceedings, if any, to be over to make any sort of decision regarding members - or risk fuelling a lynch mob-like mentality, with subjects trialled by their peers and social media before they are even charged with an offence. Granted, Weinstein could end up facing a jury one day, and I'm certainly not defending him - but we shouldn't be treating him as a criminal either. Not yet, anyway."
2017-10-21,Is one of Britain's largest companies preparing to break itself in two?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171022112550/http://news.sky.com/story/durex-splits-from-brasso-and-cillit-bang-in-group-shake-up-at-rb-11086813,"That is the conclusion from the news that consumer goods giant RB, formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, is reorganising itself into two divisions. One division, RB Health, takes in heathcare brands including Neurofen, Strepsils, Gaviscon, Clearasil and Dettol, as well as 'lifestyle' brands such as Durex, Scholl and Veet. The second, RB Hygiene Home, will own household products brands such as Air Wick, Finish, Calgon, Mr Sheen, Vanish, Brasso and Cillit Bang. This is a big shake-up for the UK's 13th-largest company, which was formed by the 1999 merger between British firm Reckitt & Colman with the Dutch company Benckiser. With a stock market value of just under £50bn, RB is a vast business that, during the last decade or so, has made a number of shrewd acquisitions of assets that it successfully identified as having good growth prospects - then managed them more aggressively than their existing owners. These included the old Boots Healthcare business in 2005, which brought in Strepsils and Neurofen; the 2008 acquisition of Adams Healthcare, which brought in Mucinex and the 2010 takeover of SSL, which added Scholl and Durex. The biggest roll of the dice came when, earlier this year, RB announced it was splashing out $16.7bn for the US baby milk maker Mead Johnson. Some businesses have been offloaded along the way, including the famous Colman's mustard brand, but most notably Indivior, a provider of opioids to people seeking to lose their heroin addiction, which was floated off in 2014. Following the Mead Johnson deal, RB also announced plans to sell its remaining food brands, including the French's mustard business. Announcing the move, RB said: ""The two business units will together form one RB - a single company devoted to delivering on our mission of creating healthier lives and happier homes."" Yet this separation of the two businesses will inevitably lead to speculation RB plans to float off its Hygiene Home arm which, accounting for 40% of sales, is the smaller of the two divisions. Adding fuel to this is that Rakesh Kapoor, RB's chief executive, will be personally heading RB Health. There is a logic to the reorganisation. Along with other consumer goods giants like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, RB is wrestling both with changing consumer habits and tastes, including disruption from internet start-ups that sell direct to the consumer and competition from supermarket own brands. All at a time when the rising price of commodities like palm oil, a key ingredient, are rising. A more formal break-up would undoubtedly be welcomed. Investors have started to fret that sales growth has stalled at RB - concerns accentuated today when RB admitted that, during the three months to the end of September, sales were down 1% on the same period on a like-for-like basis. Analysts had been expecting growth during the quarter. Adding to those worries have been a string of setbacks, including a cyberattack in June this year and an earlier scandal in South Korea involving the sale of a humidifier disinfectant linked to the deaths of more than 100 people. This has got some shareholders worrying that, given RB's well-known efficiency, whether it has been 'running too hot' or, at the very least, whether it can carry on growing profits further in a climate in which sales growth is flagging and in which it has few obvious cost cuts left to make. Adding to that unease was the sudden departure, last month, of four of the 10 members of RB's executive committee. Demerging Hygiene Home would also fit with what is thought to be Mr Kapoor's long-held ambition of turning RB into a pure consumer healthcare giant. Mead Johnson was an obvious step in bulking up in that area and there are other assets likely to be up for sale in the near future, most notably the consumer healthcare divisions of Pfizer, which includes the Advil, Centrum and Chapstick brands. Merck, another pharma giant, is also thought to be mulling the sale of its consumer healthcare arm, which makes Seven Seas vitamins and Sangobion, the iron supplement. Mr Kapoor insisted today it was too soon to say if RB will bid for either, but is known to be keen. He said integrating either would not be a concern. But RB will not have the field to itself. Nestle has also expressed an interest in bulking up in consumer healthcare, reasoning that, like RB, it is probably better-placed to distribute and sell such products than the big drug companies, which in most - but not all - cases are seeking to focus on their science and on their more profitable pharmaceutical products. It promises to be an interesting 18 months or so in the sector."

Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, who is accused of inflicting those injuries on the 18-month-old girl, had formally adopted her with his husband Craig Scully-Hicks, 36, just two weeks before she was taken to hospital on 25 May last year. Cardiff Crown Court heard Scully-Hicks, who denies murder, dialled 999 at around 6.20pm saying Elsie had gone all ""floppy and limp"" and was not breathing. Audio recordings and a transcript of the 999 call were released by the Crown Prosecution Service on Friday. A previous call to emergency services after Elsie allegedly fell down the stairs in March 2016 was also made public. In the recordings, heard by the jury last week, Scully-Hicks can be heard following instructions to administer CPR to his daughter, saying ""oh my God"". Elsie was taken from the couple's home in Llandaff, Cardiff, to University Hospital of Wales but died in the early hours of 29 May, 2016. Dr Richard Bonshek, a consultant opthalmic pathologist who examined Elsie's eyes after she died, told the court he found bleeding in both her retinas and in the tissue around her optic nerves. He said: ""Comparing these changes (in Elsie's eyes) with changes I have seen in other cases... I think that for accidental causes then one is talking of severe motor vehicle accidents, falls from heights (or) in cases when a child has been accidentally propelled down stairs or a child has been thrown down stairs."" Elsie's injuries were so severe that had she survived, she would ""most probably"" have had problems with her sight, he added. Neighbours claimed they heard Scully-Hicks, a part-time fitness instructor, shouting and swearing at Elsie when she cried. But they said they had no concerns for her welfare. The defendant is also accused of describing the little girl, who was removed from her natural mother in November 2014 and went to live with the couple in September 2015, as a ""psycho"" and ""Satan dressed up in a babygro"" in messages. She fractured her right leg in two places in November that year and suffered bruises to her head in December and January 2016. On 10 March, she was taken to hospital after falling down the stairs. Scully-Hicks denies one charge of murder. The trial continues."

The cladding on the outside failed government safety tests introduced after the Grenfell Tower disaster. Further investigations by the fire service revealed other hazards inside. Speaking to Sky News, tenant Peter Bothwell says residents needed to be rehoused until safety works are completed. Otherwise, he fears lives are being put at risk. ""We saw what happened to Grenfell and how quickly that building went up. Now that building was a lot higher than this building, but all that means is that this building will go up even quicker.""

""We know there is a great deal of work that needs to be done to Nova House to bring it up to the correct safety standards and we do not believe the current freeholder has the capacity to do what is needed for the residents."" In a statement, Ground Rent Estates 5 Ltd said it supported the council's decision to acquire Nova House as it was better equipped to resolve the issues. It said it has been working with the authorities to ensure all fire safety issues are addressed and has brought in fire wardens to monitor the building 24 hours a day. While the cladding failed tests, the insulation beneath it is made of rockwool, which is accepted as having good fire resistant qualities. Councillors have denied that it is unsafe for residents to stay in the flats, saying they are working on the advice of fire experts."

They include a demand for Parliament to be given final approval of any exit agreement. Writing in the Sunday Times, Sir Keir said the Government had withheld the legislation for two weeks running because it fears defeat on at least 13 amendments. He urged ministers to end the ""paralysis"" by working with all sides to make his recommended changes. :: MPs get the ""final say on whether to approve the withdrawal agreement and how best to implement it"". :: The transition period requested by the Prime Minister is added into the legislation. :: A ""completely different approach"" to the use of so-called Henry VIII powers which the Government argues it needs to make technical changes to regulations repatriated from Brussels, but which Sir Keir described as ""silencing Parliament and handing sweeping powers"" to ministers. :: A guarantee that workers' and consumer rights, as well as environmental standards, are not watered down after Brexit. :: A concession to devolved administrations who want repatriated powers which would normally fall under their remit to go straight to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, rather than first being taken over by the Westminster government. :: Putting the EU charter of fundamental rights into UK law. The shadow Brexit secretary wrote: ""I believe there is a consensus in Parliament for these changes. And there is certainly no majority for weakening rights, silencing Parliament and sidelining the devolved administrations. ""There is a way through this paralysis. ""Labour will work with all sides to make that happen."" The Government has already agreed to give MPs a vote on its final Brexit deal, but Sir Keir's amendment would enshrine that in law and make the outcome binding on the government. It would also give Parliament the power to veto a 'no deal' divorce. Sir Keir's intervention comes after EU leaders agreed to begin scoping work on trade talks in a move which boosted Mrs May. But they also made clear Britain must make further concessions on its divorce bill to unlock talks on a future trading relationship. David Davis will travel to Paris for Brexit talks on Monday after France appeared to emerge as the most hardline EU member state on the exit bill."

There have been thousands of books, TV shows and films about the killing of the 35th president - with opinion polls showing a majority of Americans do not believe the official conclusion that Oswald acted alone. Long-secret files on the assassination are scheduled to be released by the US National Archives next week, but Mr Trump has the final say on whether they are made public. Ahead of the deadline, the President revealed he would be allowing the documents to see the light of day, ""subject to the receipt of further information"". Politico earlier reported that Mr Trump would almost certainly block the release of some of the files, which include documents from the FBI and CIA. White House spokesman Lindsay Walters told the US politics website that the administration was working ""to ensure that the maximum amount of data can be released to the public"". Mr Trump can block the disclosure on the grounds that it would harm intelligence, law enforcement, military operations or foreign relations - and there are reports the CIA is lobbying to block some of the documents. The documents include more than 3,000 that have never been made public, and more than 30,000 that have been previously released with redactions. Kennedy assassination experts quoted in the Washington Post say they do not think the final batch of papers contains any bombshell revelations. But they add that the documents may reveal more about Oswald's trip to Mexico City in September 1963, during which he met with Cuban and Soviet spies. Despite theories claiming organised crime, Cuba or elements of the US government itself was involved, conspiracy theorists have not produced conclusive proof Oswald had co-conspirators."
2017-10-21,"Parking charges for those picking up and dropping off passengers at some of the UK's busiest airports have been hiked up to ""eye-watering"" levels, a study has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171022112550/http://news.sky.com/story/eye-watering-price-hike-for-collecting-passengers-at-airports-study-11090310,"Eight of the top 20 airports have increased tariffs this year, according to the research by motoring firm RAC, which advised drivers to ""keep goodbyes to a minimum"" as five airports raised fees for dropping off departing passengers. RAC spokesman Simon Williams warned the increased charges will be viewed by drivers as ""another way of making money out of them"". The comments come after fees rose by as much as 100% in the past year while some airports introduced completely new charges. The study found London Luton charged the most for collecting passengers at £7 for 40 minutes, London Stansted followed with £5 for half an hour, and Birmingham came third with £4.90 for one hour. Stansted is the most costly for dropping off passengers at £3.50 for 10 minutes, 50p more than Luton's charge for the same time. Liverpool John Lennon comes third £3 for 20 minutes, although a secondary drop-off point, which requires a five to 10 minutes' walk is free. Mr Williams said: ""The eye-watering drop-off and pick-up costs at some airports is likely to be viewed by drivers as another way of making money out of them, particularly in instances where public transport to and from the airport simply isn't a viable option. ""This year many airports have increased the already sky-high prices they charge for short-stay parking near their departure and arrival terminals making a good deed a costly experience. ""Drop-off charges are the biggest bone of contention as for many they appear severe when they are simply pulling up for less than five minutes and often don't even get out of the car themselves."" Seven airports offer free drop-off parking by terminals. They are: London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London City, Cardiff, Manchester, Belfast City and Jersey. But trade group, the Airport Operators Association, said income from parking supported investment in facilities and ""allows airports to keep charges to airlines low, benefiting travellers through lower air fares"". A spokesman said airports provide clear information about the cost of parking options, ensuring passengers have a ""high level of awareness"" of different ways to get to the airport. He also said drop-off charges helped manage congestion and limit the environmental impact of journeys. :: Cost of collecting passengers based on minimum stay charges (top five most expensive) 1. London Luton - £7 for 40 minutes 2. London Stansted - £5 for 30 minutes (an increase of 50p from 2016) 3. Birmingham - £4.90 for 60 minutes (an increase of 20p from 2016) 4.

Appearing at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Saturday, Smith spoke only to confirm his name, age and address. The 18-year-old, from southwest London, was remanded in custody and ordered to appear at a plea and trial preparation hearing at the Old Bailey on 25 October. His co-accused, from Durham, has also been charged with murder and threatening another man with a knife.

He also admitted a charge of handling stolen goods after the painting, titled Cookham from Englefield, was found in his home. The work, by Sir Stanley Spencer, had been stolen from the Stanley Spencer Gallery in Cookham, Berkshire, in 2012. Detectives arrested Fisher on 15 June after they stopped a Mercedes in a residential road in Strood, Kent. Inside they found one kilogram of cocaine and £30,000 in cash. A passenger in the vehicle, 32-year-old Zak Lal, of Strood, Rochester, was arrested and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and acquiring criminal property. He also admitted a charge of possession of an offensive weapon after he was found with a knife when he was arrested. Lal was jailed for five years and eight months at the same hearing on Friday. The home addresses of both men were later searched by police and officers found three kilograms of cocaine and 15,000 ecstasy tablets in Fisher's flat in Kingston. A further quantity of class A drugs and £40,000 in cash was found in a separate search at Fisher's family address in Fulham. The total street value of the drugs was estimated to be £450,000. Detective Inspector Andy Whitewood said: ""These two men were caught in possession of a considerable amount of class A drugs as the result of a proactive investigation targeting high end, organised drug supply. ""A search of Fisher's address revealed a stolen £1m painting, this demonstrates the link between drugs trafficking and serious, acquisitive crime."" A spokesman for the Stanley Spencer Gallery said its volunteers were ""immensely grateful"" for the recovery of the painting."
2017-10-21,"Brexit could cause ""catastrophic"" damage to the UK's booming culture industry, according to a survey of over 1,000 creative companies.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171022112550/http://news.sky.com/story/creative-industries-facing-catastrophic-loss-of-talent-after-brexit-11092989,"The Creative Industries Federation report into the impact of international talent on Britain's thriving arts sector, suggests a severe skills shortage is only going to worsen when freedom of movement comes to an end after leaving the European Union. The Government's most recent assessment of the creative industry's value is that it pumps £9.5m every hour into the nation's economy. But the CIF says the sector - which includes film, music, TV, fashion and architecture - relies on a highly mobile and international talent pool, often hired at short notice. Analysis in the Global Talent Report suggests 75% of all the UK's creative companies employ people from across the EU. Jellyfish Pictures, which created some of the jaw-dropping effects in Star Wars: Rogue One, employs 200 people, a third of whom are non-UK, EU nationals. Manuel Reyes Halaby, a computer graphics supervisor, says the uncertainty over his immigration status has made him consider other options. ""It makes me feel uncertain about what is going to happen, so you start checking out other possibilities,"" he said. ""There are all the other places in the world you can work, and there's a lot of work going on, so you always tend to have more cards up your sleeve."" The CEO wants urgent consideration of a Creative Freelancer Visa scheme to avoid an industry ""cliff-edge"" and ensure fast-track access to the best talent drawn from all over the world. Phil Dobree told me: ""There needs to be a very quick system for getting people in. You may be asked to do another a number of shots in a movie at short notice and if we are not able to do them because we don't have the capacity, that obviously presents a threat."" The CIF wants the Government to ensure reciprocal rights for UK workers abroad, to scrap non-EU minimum salary requirements and increase training in UK schools for creative skills, which it claims have been squeezed off the curriculum. At a recent select committee hearing, Culture Secretary Karen Bradley denied that the concern about Brexit was widespread. ""I have met a number of people in the creative industries - I'm not going to say who they are as it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say - who have told me that they're not worried about the loss of freedom of movement because they believe the sector will thrive,"" she said. But CIF CEO John Kampfner says that isn't borne out by his research. He told Sky News: ""We have more than 1,000 companies, organisations, entire creative industries - we've spoken to so many of them and overwhelmingly people are incredibly nervous about any restrictions or any strong restrictions on freedom of movement."" In response to the report's findings, a Government spokesperson said: ""The UK's creative industries are world-leading and it is crucial we work with this sector to ensure we can capitalise on the opportunities presented by Brexit. ""After we leave the EU we will have an immigration system which works in the best interests of the UK. Crucial to the development of this will be the views from a range of businesses, including the creative industries. ""We will be setting out initial proposals later in the year but we have already been clear that we are seeking an implementation period after we leave the EU to avoid a cliff edge for businesses."""

Officers from Suffolk Constabulary confirmed they will continue searching for the 23-year-old at the Milton landfill site. The extended search, expected to take four to six weeks, will focus on an area of Cell 22 next to the site of the earlier search. Police say this is the next most likely area where they could find Mr McKeague, who was last seen on CCTV last year holding a fast food container as he walked through the centre of Bury St Edmunds after a night out, before falling asleep in a shop doorway. Detectives believed Mr McKeague could have been taken away in a rubbish truck after falling into a bin but police ended the initial five-month search of the landfill site in July after no evidence of his body was found. However, a police spokesman said: ""Careful re-checking of the data available to the Major Investigation Team has concluded the area of the original 20-week search is still the location where there was the highest likelihood of finding Corrie. ""However, the nature of waste disposal and its movement is not a precise science, hence the requirement to extend the search."" :: Police release CCTV images in bid to find missing RAF gunner  Mr McKeague, who was stationed at RAF Honington in Suffolk, was last seen on September 24, 2016. His mother Nicola Urquhart spoke to Sky News last month, following the one-year anniversary of her son's disappearance. She said: ""I never imagined we would be here one year later - I can't actually believe it's a year, it has just gone past in a blur. ""It's difficult but I feel like we are doing things that are constructive and proactive to try to assist the investigation. ""There is still so much more that can be done and is getting done by the police and we'll just keep trying to help them. That's how we're coping."""

Since September 2016, Highways England has trialled different speed limits and is now considering rolling out a 55mph or 60mph limit where it is safe to do so. The government-owned company's chief executive, Jim O'Sullivan, said the 60mph limit was ""something that we want to introduce to as many roadworks as possible"". But he told The Times that lower speeds are likely to be maintained in areas with narrow lanes, contraflows or where workers are close to the road. Mr O'Sullivan said the ""volume of roadworks that the network and our users can cope with is probably reaching its peak"". He added: ""If we're going to have this volume of roadworks, we need to have some serious thought about how we improve the customer experience."" In two separate trials, more than 70 motorists were provided with dashboard cameras, watches with heart rate monitors and GPS trackers to monitor their reactions. In a 60mph trial zone, 60% of participants recorded a decrease in their average heart rate. Meanwhile, 56% showed a decrease on the 55mph trial. Further trials are set to take place later this year and, depending on the results, higher limits could be introduced more widely in 2018."

The violence erupted when security forces targeted insurgents near the Bahariya oasis in the country's Western Desert, about 100 miles from the capital Cairo. Following a lead, they were deployed to a militant camp where eight suspected members of the extremist Hasm Movement were believed to be hiding, said security sources. Insurgents on higher ground then used rocket-propelled grenades and explosives to ambush a convoy of four 4x4s and an interior ministry vehicle, it was reported. Police had to call in air support as the clashes continued for several hours and there were warnings the number of dead could rise. It was one of the largest losses of life for security forces since the army removed Islamist president Mohammed Morsi from power in 2013. After he was deposed, extremist groups launched increasing numbers of attacks on the military and police. Egypt has struggled to contain an insurgency led by Islamic State-affiliated group, Ansar Bayt al Maqdis. The uprising has centred mostly in the northern region of the Sinai Peninsula, around 300 miles from the latest violence. No militant group has yet claimed involvement in the Giza firefight.

Abu Sa'eed left for Syria in 2014 and is on a UN sanctions list. He was prolific online and regularly posted videos and blogs from Syria denouncing the West and glorifying IS. But there were clearly tensions within his life with the militants. :: Inside Islamic State's prisons of death in fallen Raqqa He wrote on a blog he missed his mum's cooking and foods like Jaffa Cakes and fish fingers. Back in his home town, High Wycombe, community leader Mohammed Khaliel has been supporting his family. He told Sky News: ""He was a salesman for an extremist group - ISIS - and I think it's ironic that the very group that he was trying to attract others into have tortured him to death. ""I hope that speaks volumes to youngsters thinking of travelling to these dangerous parts of the world."" High Wycombe has been identified as an area where radicalisation is a problem. Local mosques insist they are working to educate vulnerable young Muslims. At the Wycombe Islamic Society mosque, where Abu Sa'eed worshipped before he left for Syria, they run a programme of youth classes. Staff there described Abu Sa'eed as a ""loner"" and say he never spoke of his radical views or intention to travel to Syria. Abu Sa'eed was dubbed the ""Supermarket Jihadi"" because he'd worked as a security guard in the local Morrison's. Despite his many social media posts, we know he fell out with IS leaders who'd issued him a warning after he advised potential recruits to go to Libya and not Syria. His last activity online was in July this year. The only clue as to what happened is a scratch mark bearing his name inside a notorious IS prison where inmates were routinely tortured and executed. Terror analyst Milo Comerford, from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, said it is not uncommon for British jihadists to struggle with life in Syria. He said: ""Western Jihadis come with a preconception of what they would be doing. ""They thought that they would be fighting, they thought that they would be on the frontline of ISIS's crusade across Iraq and Syria, and actually the reality turned out to be very different. ""People are often put in positions of support, of cooking, they were untrained, they didn't have the military skills, and many were frustrated by this."""

In a report it produced this year, Women's Aid spoke to 404 women who were all refused space in a refuge on at least one occasion. For 45% of the women, there had been three or more occasions when there had been no space. Only a quarter were eventually found suitable accommodation. New legislation announced by the Government in June, defining domestic abuse in law, establish a domestic violence commissioner as well as harsher punishment for perpetrators. But while this announcement was welcomed, campaigners say it does little to address historic cuts to services, and that funding for refuges should be ring-fenced to provide a long-term solution. The Department for Communities and Local Government told Sky News: ""We expect local authorities to provide specialist accommodation and services that are appropriate, and reflect the needs of victims and their families. ""We're investing £100m in programmes to tackle violence against women and girls. ""This includes £20m to create more refuge spaces and provide specialist support within safe accommodation for more than 19,000 victims to rebuild their lives."""

Although around one million homes are bought and sold in England every year, a quarter of sales fall through. Mr Javid said the Government was looking for views on: :: Gazumping - when a seller accepts a higher offer after already a agreeing to a sale :: Confidence - schemes like ""lock-in agreements"" could build trust in the housing chain :: Innovation - Putting more data online could speed up the house-buying process, which is ""too slow"" and expensive :: Information - encouraging buyers and sellers to pull together evidence so homes are sale ready. Mr Javid said: ""We want to help everyone have a good quality home they can afford, and improving the process of buying and selling is part of delivering that. ""Buying a home is one of life's largest investments, so if it goes wrong it can be costly. ""That's why we're determined to take action to make the process cheaper, faster and less stressful. ""This can help save people money and time so they can focus on what matters - finding their dream home. ""I want to hear from the industry on what more we can do to tackle this issue."" The Government also published a survey of 2,000 people which showed 69% of sellers and 62% of buyers report stress and worry as a result of delays. Nearly half (46%) of sellers had concerns about buyers changing their minds after making an offer and almost a quarter (24%) would use a different estate agent if they had to go through the process again. Almost a third (32%) of sellers and 28% of buyers were unhappy with the other party's solicitor, the Department for Communities and Local Government said. Shadow housing secretary John Healey described the proposals as ""feeble"" and said they showed ministers do not understand the scale of the problems facing buyers. He said: ""This smacks of a political diversion from the hard facts of the Tories' housing record..

Two million pounds will be spent on 5,600 body-worn cameras which will be made available to prison guards in England and Wales, following the successful roll-out of the cameras among 22,000 Metropolitan Police officers last October. Plans announced by the Prisons Minister Sam Gyimah also include £1m for new police-style handcuffs and restraints, which will reduce the need for staff to use physical holds to control aggressive prisoners. Four prisons - HMP Wealstun, HMP Risley, HMP Preston and HMP Hull - will also trial PAVA incapacitant spray, similar to pepper spray, to boost officer safety. Mr Gyimah said: ""Prison officers do an incredibly hard job. Assaults on prison officers are up 34% in the last year. Of course prison officers have got to be professional at all times but where these cameras could make a real difference is with prosecutions and also deterring assaults against prison officers. ""I am absolutely determined to tackle head-on the issues that undermine the safety and security of our prisons and to ensure our dedicated officers have the tools they need to do the job."" The Prison Officers Association welcomed the introduction of the new safety measures, but told Sky News the central issue remains the number of guards. In a statement, the union said: ""Whilst we welcome protective measures such as PAVA spray and body worn cameras nothing can replace correct and safe staffing levels. ""The 30% cut to staff since 2010 and the increase in violence and riots during that period still has to be addressed and equipment is no replacement for staff."" The Government says 1,290 extra prison officers have been recruited, but admits that number is below its own target of 2,500. Former convict John Hirst told Sky News there needs to be a more widespread reform of the prison system. He said: ""What they need to do is improve conditions. Some of the prisons are still Victorian and they still use Victorian prison rules. ""If you keep dehumanising prisoners when you put them into the system in the first place, how do you think they are going to behave?"" The Government says £10m has already been given to priority prisons to ramp up additional security measures including 24-hour patrol dogs, CCTV cameras, mobile phone detection technology and metal detectors."

It was written on embossed Titanic stationery by first-class passenger Alexander Oskar Holverson, who was intending to post it to his mother in New York. The salesman had boarded the Titanic in Southampton with his wife Mary, who survived the disaster. She never remarried - and according to Encyclopaedia Titanica, she was buried with her husband in New York after dying of kidney failure in 1918 at the age of 41. In the letter, he says the couple ""had good weather while we were in London"", adding that England was ""quite green and nice"". Describing the Titanic as ""a palatial hotel"", Mr Holverson writes: ""The food and music is excellent and so far we have had very good weather. ""If all goes well we will arrive in New York (on) Wednesday"". The Minnesota-born passenger also shared tales of rubbing shoulders with one of the ship's most famous passengers - a man who would also die on board the doomed liner. ""John Jacob Astor is on this ship,"" he said of the American financier and real-estate investor, who was one of the world's richest men at the time. ""He looks like any other human being even though he has millions of money. They sit out on deck with the rest of us."" The letter, written on three of its four pages, was discovered in Mr Holverson's pocket notebook when his body was recovered. The acid-rich paper remained legible despite being stained by salt water. After the disaster, the letter was received by Mr Holverson's mother and remained in the family. It had a reserve price of £60,000 to £80,000 during an auction of Titanic memorabilia at Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire on Saturday. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described the item as ""exceptional on several levels including content, historical context and rarity"". He added: ""I'm delighted with the new world record for the Titanic letter. ""It reflects its status as the most important Titanic letter that we have ever auctioned."" A set of rusty locker keys that belonged to a Titanic cabin steward also sold at the auction for £76,000. In April 2014, the last letter written on the ship fetched £119,000 after being auctioned by Henry Aldridge & Son. Survivors Esther Hart and her seven-year-old daughter Eva penned the note just eight hours before the ship hit the iceberg."

Diesel and petrol vehicles, including HGVs, busses and coaches, registered before 2006 which do not meet the Euro 4/IV European directive to regulate vehicle emissions. For motorised tricycles or quadricycles, they must meet the Euro 3 standard. For newer vehicles, the Euro emission standard may be listed on your vehicles V5C document in section D.2. Motorcycles, along with taxis and private hire vehicles licensed with Transport for London (TfL), are not subject to the T-charge. A small number of ""early adopter"" vehicles manufactured before the Euro 4/IV standard became mandatory will have a NOx and PM emissions that meet the Euro 4/IV or better. These vehicles will not be subject to the charge either. You can check if your vehicle is subject to the charge using TfL's T-charge checker. :: What area does the T-charge cover? It covers the same area in central London and operating times as the congestion charge zone, which is in operation between Monday and Friday, 7am to 6pm. :: How do I pay the T-charge? You can pay the £10 in addition to the £11.50 congestion charge online at tfl.gov.uk TfL also has an auto-pay service, which you can set up through its website. :: What if I don't pay? You will receive a penalty charge notice of £130, which is reduced to £65 if it is paid within 14 days. If it is not paid within 28 days, the fine rises to £195. :: Can I get a discount? If you are already registered for a congestion charge discount - other than the 9+ seater discount - it will also apply to the T-charge. :: Why is this happening? The move comes as part of TfL's attempts to improve air quality in London. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan insists ""tackling poor air quality is a public health emergency that requires bold action"". :: Drivers of the most polluting vehicles face toxicity charge to enter central London"

Alex Mulholland told Sky News that the gunman was white, with a ""greyish beard"" and ""weird looking"". ""He was saying 'game over, game over', everyone shouting, screaming, panicking, trying to get out and I didn't know what to make of it, really,"" he said. ""I ran, got my things as quickly as I could and get out of there."" After most people managed to leave the bowling alley, they remained outside the premises as they waited for police to arrive. But about 10 minutes later, the gunman also came out to the front with the shotgun to ""make sure everyone was scared and that everyone knew he was there"", according to witness Liam Roberts. A third witness has described how the gunman had a ""very aggressive demeanour"", was armed with a sawn-off shotgun and was shouting and swearing. Lawrence Hallett and his family were enjoying bowling at a children's party when a member of staff told him to leave as the gunman was inside. He said: ""One of the staff came up to us and quietly whispered in my ear to leave. ""I initially thought it was a fire alarm or something like that and I said 'What's the problem? We are halfway through a game' and he said 'There is a gunman'."" He told Sky News that the gunman was around 20-30ft away at the ""top end of the lanes"" with a shotgun slung over his shoulder. Mr Hallett said: ""I thought it was a joke and panicked a little bit."" He and his family then ran ""hell for leather"" out of the building before the gunman later also came out and started swearing. The witness said he was not speaking to anyone in particular but had a ""very aggressive demeanour"". Mr Hallett said: ""We hung around outside for a little while ... we didn't know what to do, what was going on. And he came out and swore and said 'what the heck are you guys' ... unslung his gun and went back in again. ""And at that point we backed off to our cars."" The witness said: ""There was no organised withdrawal. There was a guy with a gun."" Mr Hallett added: ""We headed for the cars in a bit of a panic"", and managed to get to safety at the Bermuda Park retail complex. He described the gunman as around 40 years old, ""rough around the edges"" and unshaven. The chief executive of MFA Bowl, Mehdi Afshar, confirmed two workers had been held hostage.

The Bermuda Park retail park was in lockdown for more than four hours while the suspect held the male workers inside the bowling alley. He was treated at the scene and taken to hospital, according to West Midlands Ambulance Service. Firearms officers and police negotiators, as well as other emergency services staff, rushed to the scene after the first reports of a gunman emerged at about 2.30pm on Sunday. Bangs and flashes were reported shortly before news of the arrest emerged at about 7pm, with about 15 armed officers seen running towards the bowling alley. An ambulance made its way through the cordon and two people got out approximately 10 minutes later. Chris Clegg, operations director of MFA Bowl, said the two employees were checked over for shock, while the suspect was handcuffed. Terrified families either fled the retail park - which includes restaurants, a cinema and a soft play area - or hid until police said it was safe for them to leave. Alex Mulholland, who was in the bowling alley along with 40 or 50 others, saw the gunman enter and brandish the weapon.

It said the current spending squeeze facing households from inflation outpacing wage growth could be eased by accelerating increases in the personal allowance and through not raising income tax rates. The BRC said a looming £270m business rates rise faced by retailers next April should be suspended, allowing firms to invest the money in keeping prices down instead. Its call for taxes to be frozen has been echoed by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Its director general Adam Marshall said: ""Action to slash the upfront costs faced by business, to incentiviseinvestment, and to improve mobile coverage and infrastructure would lead to a real boost to productivity, wages and trade. ""A Budget that prioritises goodies and giveaways rather than future-proofing the economy would be a dereliction of duty by the government as a whole,"" he said. The BCC had earlier joined other business lobby groups in signing a joint letter urging the Government to secure an ""urgent"" transitional agreement with the EU to give firms greater certainty on a smooth Brexit. The BRC argued the Chancellor had an opportunity to show that ministers understood the pressures. Its chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: ""At a time of uncertainty for both the economy and the country, it is important we set ourselves up for success. ""The cumulative burden of Government imposed costs has become acute. Indeed, September's inflation figures mean retailers are faced with a £270m leap in their business rate tax bills alone next spring. ""With retailers' margins being squeezed to their limit, this is money that could be better spent investing in keeping prices low for consumers, in local communities up and down the country and in developing a workforce which is fit for the future. ""Without the Chancellor's intervention, the consequences for town centres and jobs will be even more keenly felt in the most vulnerable communities."""

The victim, understood to be Jess Wilkes, 27, had spent the evening at a restaurant on the river island of Barthelasse with eight friends - four French and four British - aged between 20 and 30. Ms Wilkes, understood to be mother to a seven-year-old daughter, was from Lamberhurst, Kent. Her brother, Philip Wilkes, 25, told The Sun his sister was ""larger than life and loved by her family"". Her father, Bernard Wilkes, 72, said they ""want answers"" over the death of his ""beautiful young girl who lived life to the full"". The group of tourists were returning to the city of Avignon on a 7m (23ft) boat driven by a helmsman when the crash took place at about 10.45pm (9.45pm UK time) on Saturday night. Five other people, including one Briton, were taken to hospital after the collision, two of them with serious injuries. Police are now investigating the cause of the accident. Officers say victims and witnesses are yet to be questioned because they are in shock. A free boat shuttle service runs from just east of the Pont d'Avignon across to the island, taking about 10 minutes to cross. Set on the river, just a few minutes from the cities of Avignon and Villeneuve les Avignon, the island is popular with tourists due to its rural landscape and riverside walks."

TV and radio adverts and posters have been produced to discourage patients from asking their GPs for antibiotics as the NHS heads into the busy winter period. Professor Paul Cosford, medical director at PHE, said: ""Antibiotic resistance is not a distant threat, but is in fact one of the most dangerous global crises facing the modern world today. ""Taking antibiotics when you don't need them puts you and your family at risk of developing infections which in turn cannot be easily treated with antibiotics. ""Without urgent action from all of us, common infections, minor injuries and routine operations will become much riskier."" It's estimated that 5,000 people die every year in England because antibiotics no longer work for some infections. Genevieve Barnott Jones has a lung condition called bronchiectasis, which means she regularly gets infections. Some can't be treated with any type of antibiotic. She travelled to Georgia to access new types of treatment. She told Sky News: ""It's quite a big threat to not only people's health but people are dying from antibiotic resistance so it's a serious problem and I'm really glad that they're finally starting to address it. ""I was in hospital with people who have the same problem and they're not old people, or very vulnerable people, it's just ordinary people like you and me suddenly falling victim to what's almost like an unknown plague."" England's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has already warned of a ""post-antibiotic apocalypse"", where antibiotics no longer work for serious infections. She said: ""Without effective antibiotics, minor infections could become deadly and many medical advances could be at risk - surgery, chemotherapy and Caesareans could become simply too dangerous. ""But reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics can help us stay ahead of superbugs. ""The public has a critical role to play and can help by taking collective action."" Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria changes in such a way that the medication used to treat them - in this case antibiotics - becomes ineffective. The Government wants to see the number of prescriptions handed out by GP's drop by 50% by 2020/21 to help combat the threat from resistance. Meanwhile, British scientists have found a bacterial ""Archilles heel"", that may help overcome antibiotic resistance. The target is an enzyme relied on by many bugs to destroy beta-lactams, a common kind of antibiotic. The scientists found that a combination of two enzyme-inhibitors and the antibiotic aztreonam was able to kill some of the most resistant bacteria known. Dr Matthew Avison, from the University of Bristol's School of Cellular & Molecular Medicine, said: ""At the risk of sounding like King Canute, it is the first time for a decade that there is some genuine positivity about our ability to turn back the rising tide of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance."""

The £10 charge adds to the £11.50 congestion charge already in place and covers the same area and operating times as the existing congestion charge zone. Mr Khan said: ""We don't make a profit from the T-charge - it's costing us. So the T-charge will cost us money but I think that's a price worth paying to improve the quality of our air… the T-charge will cost us, roughly speaking, £7m a year."" :: What you need to know about toxicity charging The Mayor said the cost of poor quality air in London is £3.7bn each year, with poorer Londoners having to ""suffer the worst consequences of poor quality air"". He said he aimed to ""discourage"" people from driving high polluting vehicles instead of banning them completely. The new charge mainly applies to diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006 which do not meet the so-called ""Euro 4"" European directive to regulate vehicle emissions. Mr Khan has launched the T-charge to tackle London's air pollution and prepare the city for the introduction of the ultra-low emission zone, which he plans to introduce in April 2019. He said the ultra-low emissions zone would ""bring in revenues and that revenue will be ring-fenced to improve the quality of air"". Friends of the Earth campaigner Jenny Bates says Mr Khan is ""right to try to dissuade drivers bringing the oldest, dirtiest vehicles into central London"" but warns it is ""only one small step towards clean air"". She said: ""We urgently need a programme of meaningful financial assistance to help drivers of the dirtiest vehicles switch to something cleaner, and bold policies to cut traffic over all."" Some people believe the new scheme will have huge knock-on effects and will penalise the poor. Rod McKenzie, director of policy at the Road Haulage Association, told Sky News: ""It will effectively outlaw and certainly tax all older vehicles and make business more expensive - it could even put some hauliers out of business."" :: Are you affected by the new charge?

It said MLI failed to report 68.5 million exchange traded derivative transactions over two years until February last year. These are essentially bets - an arrangement or product - which derive value from real assets such as commodities or currencies that are guaranteed against default. Mark Steward, the FCA's executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: ""Effective market oversight depends on accurate and timely reporting of transactions."" He added: ""It is vital that reporting firms ensure their transaction reporting systems are tested as fit for purpose, adequately resourced and perform properly. ""There needs to be a line in the sand. We will continue to take appropriate action against any firm that fails to meet requirements."" The FCA said MLI would have been fined £49.3m had it not agreed to settle at an early stage in its investigation. The regulator said the company had been ""open and co-operative"" and quickly taken steps to remediate the breach. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it had informed the FCA of the breach. Its statement said: ""We are wholly committed to complying with all applicable regulatory requirements.

The Codebreakers and Groundbreakers exhibition in Cambridge will also feature other personal items and rarely seen coding devices from the Turing Archive held at King's College in the city. The report from Sherborne School in Dorset showed Turing, who later carried out groundbreaking work in cracking the Enigma encryption used by the Nazis, had room for improvement, according to his teachers. Criticising his presentation style, a teacher reminded him to provide a ""neat and tidy solution on paper"". A physics teacher noted that he had done ""some good work, but generally sets it down badly"". The teacher added: ""He must remember that Cambridge will want sound knowledge rather than vague ideas."" However they did note Turing, who went on to study at the University of Cambridge's King's College, had ""distinct promise"" in maths. Also on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum will be letters he sent from Britain's former codebreaking headquarters Bletchley Park, to his mother about his sponsorship of two Jewish refugees. The collection will include a mathematics book chosen by Turing as a prize to honour a close friend, as well as a teaspoon taken from the codebreaker's home after his death in 1954 from cyanide poisoning. Coding devices will also go on display after permission was granted by GCHQ. A spokesman said: ""We are pleased to be loaning two World War II coding devices rarely made available for public viewing."" The exhibition runs from Tuesday until 4 February next year. Other prominent figures who were doubted by their teachers include theoretical physicist Albert Einstein, whose schoolmaster said he would ""never amount to anything"", and former prime minister Sir Winston Churchill, whose teacher said he had ""no ambition""."

2017-10-22,Police are targeting two young sisters in the hunt for their fugitive father Mark Acklom who is on the run with them in Europe.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171023121454/http://news.sky.com/story/police-are-searching-for-the-daughters-of-fugitive-conman-mark-acklom-11094642,"Detectives are concerned for the girls' emotional welfare and are urging the public to try to identify them. Officers believe the key to tracing conman Acklom, 44, is to find the school where his children are registered. Acklom's two daughters, aged eight and six, are likely to be registered at an international school, probably in Spain, where they have grown up with their Spanish mother. Police also believe the girls' mother, Acklom's wife Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez, 47, is helping her husband avoid capture. He is wanted for allegedly fleecing a British woman of her life savings after promising to marry her. Detective Inspector Adam Bunting, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""We believe Acklom and his wife are in the company of their two daughters, girls aged eight and six. We believe they will be enrolled at an international, fee-paying school on the continent."" The girls were suddenly removed from their private school El Limonar in the village of El Palmar near Murcia a year ago, when Sky News revealed that their father was about to be added to the Most Wanted list. DI Bunting said: ""They've been uprooted away from their family, away from their friends, away from their school overnight. They didn't have a chance to say goodbye to their friends. ""As they are living on the run with their father, who is a wanted fugitive, we have significant concerns for their wellbeing."" Acklom, who uses the name Marc Ros Rodriguez and other aliases, is the subject of a European arrest warrant and is on the Crimestoppers and National Crime Agency's Most Wanted lists. He is wanted for fraud, an alleged romance scam on Carolyn Woods, who was running a boutique in Gloucestershire when Acklom met her in 2012. Ms Woods said he told her he was a wealthy Swiss banker and MI6 agent, and promised to marry her during a year-long romance, during which he duped her into lending him her life savings of £850,000. At the time Acklom pretended to be commuting daily from Zurich, but was apparently living nearby with his wife and daughters. Ms Woods, now aged 58, said Acklom left her destitute and emotionally wrecked and she considered suicide. Acklom has been spotted once in his year on the run - he was photographed at the terrace table of a cafe in Geneva, Switzerland, in May. He was sitting chatting to a Spanish fellow fugitive, Jose Manuel Costas Estevez. Police say Acklom is probably in Spain, where he has lived in the past, but is fluent in several languages and has connections to Italy and Ireland. He could have travelled outside Europe. His wife has been involved in various property companies, sometimes with her husband, and she may be working as a yoga teacher or attending yoga classes, officers say. DI Bunting said: ""We don't think she has committed any crime, but I have no doubt she is aware of his fugitive status and is willingly travelling with him and their children. ""We want ex-pats with children in international schools to let us know if they have noticed the recent arrival of a family with two young girls. The family will appear to be Spanish, but all speaking good English."" :: Anyone in the UK with information is urged to call, anonymously, the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111, or from Spain dial 900 555 111.

He told the Chatham House conference in London: ""These are the commitments that we hope will encourage Kim Jong Un to halt his nuclear development programme, to come to the negotiating table and thereby to take the only path that can guarantee the security of the region as a whole."" The Trump administration's top diplomat, Rex Tillerson, has been attempting to negotiate with Pyongyang to stop it carrying out tests of long-range missiles and nuclear devices. Mr Johnson said ""no one... in the UK or even around the world wants any kind of military solution"" to North Korea's nuclear threat. However, he said Mr Kim ""and the world"" should understand that in the face of a ""regime led by a man who not only threatens to reduce New York to ashes, but who stands of the verge of acquiring the power to make good on his threat"", the US President would ""have an absolute duty to keep safe not only the American people but all those who have sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella"". In a later question and answer session, Mr Johnson responded to a question from Sky News' Alistair Bunkall on whether he could foresee any circumstances in which the UK would support a pre-emptive strike by the US by saying: ""It must remain on the table. ""There is a spectrum of things that could be done. It is the duty of any President of the United States, given the threat that his or her country could face, to at least explore those military options."" Mr Johnson had used an earlier part of his speech to extol the success of the Iran treaty, called the joint comprehensive plan of action, which he said stood to avert a ""perilous and debilitating arms race"". He went on to add: ""In short, Pyongyang faces the same dilemma as Tehran. By continuing to develop nuclear weapons Kim risks provoking a reaction in the region that is at once defensive and competitive, that reduces not increases his security (and) the survival chances of his regime... ""Until he understands that, I feel we have no choice but to step up the pressure on Pyongyang."" Mr Johnson said, amid the ""urgent"" need for China to ""address"" the problem of North Korea, there is ""unprecedented discussion between China and the US on how to handle this crisis"", a closeness he said boded well for the future. ""Whatever we think of the regime and its behaviour, the ruling elite in North Korea is in the end composed of human beings. We must find ways of getting through to them but at the same time, not just toughening the sanctions regime, enforcing those in place. ""It won't be easy, but the costs of failure could be catastrophic."" In stating why, he underlined why he felt the UK's nuclear arsenal remained necessary, harking back to Britain's role in negotiating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the late 1960s. ""To wield a nuclear deterrent as this country does, is neither easy nor cheap... We are one of the handful specifically recognised by the NPT to possess such dreadful weapons... and by holding that stockpile, we play our part in deterring the ambitions of rogue states."""

He made a guest appearance as a villain in the Sarah Jane Adventures in 2008. Whittaker, who takes over from Peter Capaldi, will be the 13th Time Lord, and Walsh had been tipped to be the sidekick to the show's first female lead. Walsh, 57, who has starred in Coronation Street and Law & Order: UK as well as presenting The Chase, said: ""I remember watching William Hartnell as the first Doctor. ""Black and white made it very scary for a youngster like myself."" ""I was petrified, but even though I'd watch most of it from behind the sofa through my fingers, I became a fan,"" Walsh added. ""Am I thrilled to be part of this whole groundbreaking new dawn for the Doctor? Oh yes!"" But Walsh isn't the only actor revealed as a companion to the Doctor. Rising stars Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole will swap their roles in Hollyoaks for the inside of the Tardis. Cole joined the Hollyoaks cast in 2011 as Neil Cooper and also appeared in spin-off Hollyoaks Later, but is ""grateful and excited to be part of this journey with the team"". ""I'm looking forward to jumping in this Doctor Who universe,"" he said. Gill played Hollyoaks' Phoebe McQueen in her first ever TV role, and said she is ""over the moon to be joining the Doctor Who family"". ""Certain roles seem unattainable and this is one of those, so much so I didn't believe it to be true for the first few weeks,"" she added. ""This show is worlds away from the work I've done previously and that's the part that excites me the most."" The BBC confirmed the series will have a 10-week run in autumn 2018."

In a significant departure from party policy, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""What I want to do is make sure we're using everything I have available to deal with the housing crisis. ""Where that means, for example, we can sensibly borrow more to invest in the infrastructure that leads to more housing, take advantage of some of the record low interest rates that we have, I think we should absolutely be considering that... ""We have to continue to be bold in this area. We set out some measures during the conference but there is a lot more to do. ""This is one of the biggest barriers to social progress in this country."" He called for between 250,000 and 300,000 new houses to be built every year to fix the issue failed on by ""successive governments"". And in an act of either public lobbying or hint-dropping, Mr Javid was coy about Chancellor Philip Hammond's plans for the Autumn Budget. Asked if Mr Hammond supported it, the Bromsgrove MP said: ""Let's wait and see what happens in the Budget."" But Labour hit back, with shadow housing secretary John Healey saying: ""If hot air built homes, ministers would have fixed our housing crisis. ""Any promise of new investment is welcome, but the reality is spending on new affordable homes has been slashed since 2010 so new affordable housebuilding is at a 24 year low. ""Rather than set more targets they can't meet, ministers should back Labour's plan to build 100,000 genuinely affordable homes a year, including the biggest council housebuilding programme in more than 30 years."" The Government is likely to be planning policies to win back young voters, who largely voted for Labour in the snap 2017 General Election. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Theresa May announced £9.1bn for an affordable housing programme to be spent on new homes before 2021. She used her Tory conference speech to highlight how just 38% of those aged 25-34 own their own home, compared to 59% just over a decade ago."

Officers from Suffolk Constabulary confirmed they will continue searching for the 23-year-old at the Milton landfill site. The extended search, expected to take four to six weeks, will focus on an area of Cell 22 next to the site of the earlier search. Police say this is the next most likely area where they could find Mr McKeague, who was last seen on CCTV last year holding a fast food container as he walked through the centre of Bury St Edmunds after a night out, before falling asleep in a shop doorway. Detectives believed Mr McKeague could have been taken away in a rubbish truck after falling into a bin but police ended the initial five-month search of the landfill site in July after no evidence of his body was found. However, a police spokesman said: ""Careful re-checking of the data available to the Major Investigation Team has concluded the area of the original 20-week search is still the location where there was the highest likelihood of finding Corrie. ""However, the nature of waste disposal and its movement is not a precise science, hence the requirement to extend the search."" :: Police release CCTV images in bid to find missing RAF gunner  Mr McKeague, who was stationed at RAF Honington in Suffolk, was last seen on September 24, 2016. His mother Nicola Urquhart spoke to Sky News last month, following the one-year anniversary of her son's disappearance. She said: ""I never imagined we would be here one year later - I can't actually believe it's a year, it has just gone past in a blur. ""It's difficult but I feel like we are doing things that are constructive and proactive to try to assist the investigation.

It was written on embossed Titanic stationery by first-class passenger Alexander Oskar Holverson, who was intending to post it to his mother in New York. The salesman had boarded the Titanic in Southampton with his wife Mary, who survived the disaster. She never remarried - and according to Encyclopaedia Titanica, she was buried with her husband in New York after dying of kidney failure in 1918 at the age of 41. In the letter, he says the couple ""had good weather while we were in London"", adding that England was ""quite green and nice"". Describing the Titanic as ""a palatial hotel"", Mr Holverson writes: ""The food and music is excellent and so far we have had very good weather. ""If all goes well we will arrive in New York (on) Wednesday"". The Minnesota-born passenger also shared tales of rubbing shoulders with one of the ship's most famous passengers - a man who would also die on board the doomed liner. ""John Jacob Astor is on this ship,"" he said of the American financier and real-estate investor, who was one of the world's richest men at the time. ""He looks like any other human being even though he has millions of money. They sit out on deck with the rest of us."" The letter, written on three of its four pages, was discovered in Mr Holverson's pocket notebook when his body was recovered. The acid-rich paper remained legible despite being stained by salt water. After the disaster, the letter was received by Mr Holverson's mother and remained in the family. It had a reserve price of £60,000 to £80,000 during an auction of Titanic memorabilia at Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire on Saturday. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described the item as ""exceptional on several levels including content, historical context and rarity"". He added: ""I'm delighted with the new world record for the Titanic letter. ""It reflects its status as the most important Titanic letter that we have ever auctioned."" A set of rusty locker keys that belonged to a Titanic cabin steward also sold at the auction for £76,000. In April 2014, the last letter written on the ship fetched £119,000 after being auctioned by Henry Aldridge & Son. Survivors Esther Hart and her seven-year-old daughter Eva penned the note just eight hours before the ship hit the iceberg."

He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live that there were ""very difficult moral issues"". But the Foreign Office minister warned: ""They are absolutely dedicated, as members of the Islamic State, towards the creation of a caliphate. ""They believe in an extremely hateful doctrine which involves killing themselves, killing others and trying to use violence and brutality to create an eighth century, or seventh century, state. ""I'm afraid we have to be serious about the fact these people are a serious danger to us, and unfortunately the only way of dealing with them will be, in almost every case, to kill them."" A former diplomat, Mr Stewart went on to say: ""These are people who are executing people in the back of their heads, who have held women and children hostage, who are torturing and murdering trying by violence to impose their will. ""Our response has to be, when somebody does that, I'm afraid, to deal with that."" Mr Stewart also urged Britons who wanted to join the fight against IS to do so through official channels. ""If you wish to serve your country and you wish to fight terrorism, then please apply to join the military or join the police or join our intelligence services, we'll train you, we'll work with you to do it in a legal and controlled fashion,"" he said. MI5 believes at least 850 Britons have gone to fight for IS since 2014, with around half having returned home. The most notable conscripts include former punk rocker Sally Jones, who worked as an IS recruiter, and ""Jihadi John"" - real name Mohammed Emwazi - who appeared in multiple videos showing the execution of foreign hostages. Both died in drone strikes in Syria but hundreds more are expected to still be fighting for IS in the country."
2017-10-22,Is one of Britain's largest companies preparing to break itself in two?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171023121454/http://news.sky.com/story/durex-splits-from-brasso-and-cillit-bang-in-group-shake-up-at-rb-11086813,"That is the conclusion from the news that consumer goods giant RB, formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, is reorganising itself into two divisions. One division, RB Health, takes in heathcare brands including Neurofen, Strepsils, Gaviscon, Clearasil and Dettol, as well as 'lifestyle' brands such as Durex, Scholl and Veet. The second, RB Hygiene Home, will own household products brands such as Air Wick, Finish, Calgon, Mr Sheen, Vanish, Brasso and Cillit Bang. This is a big shake-up for the UK's 13th-largest company, which was formed by the 1999 merger between British firm Reckitt & Colman with the Dutch company Benckiser. With a stock market value of just under £50bn, RB is a vast business that, during the last decade or so, has made a number of shrewd acquisitions of assets that it successfully identified as having good growth prospects - then managed them more aggressively than their existing owners. These included the old Boots Healthcare business in 2005, which brought in Strepsils and Neurofen; the 2008 acquisition of Adams Healthcare, which brought in Mucinex and the 2010 takeover of SSL, which added Scholl and Durex. The biggest roll of the dice came when, earlier this year, RB announced it was splashing out $16.7bn for the US baby milk maker Mead Johnson. Some businesses have been offloaded along the way, including the famous Colman's mustard brand, but most notably Indivior, a provider of opioids to people seeking to lose their heroin addiction, which was floated off in 2014. Following the Mead Johnson deal, RB also announced plans to sell its remaining food brands, including the French's mustard business. Announcing the move, RB said: ""The two business units will together form one RB - a single company devoted to delivering on our mission of creating healthier lives and happier homes."" Yet this separation of the two businesses will inevitably lead to speculation RB plans to float off its Hygiene Home arm which, accounting for 40% of sales, is the smaller of the two divisions. Adding fuel to this is that Rakesh Kapoor, RB's chief executive, will be personally heading RB Health. There is a logic to the reorganisation. Along with other consumer goods giants like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, RB is wrestling both with changing consumer habits and tastes, including disruption from internet start-ups that sell direct to the consumer and competition from supermarket own brands. All at a time when the rising price of commodities like palm oil, a key ingredient, are rising. A more formal break-up would undoubtedly be welcomed. Investors have started to fret that sales growth has stalled at RB - concerns accentuated today when RB admitted that, during the three months to the end of September, sales were down 1% on the same period on a like-for-like basis. Analysts had been expecting growth during the quarter. Adding to those worries have been a string of setbacks, including a cyberattack in June this year and an earlier scandal in South Korea involving the sale of a humidifier disinfectant linked to the deaths of more than 100 people. This has got some shareholders worrying that, given RB's well-known efficiency, whether it has been 'running too hot' or, at the very least, whether it can carry on growing profits further in a climate in which sales growth is flagging and in which it has few obvious cost cuts left to make. Adding to that unease was the sudden departure, last month, of four of the 10 members of RB's executive committee. Demerging Hygiene Home would also fit with what is thought to be Mr Kapoor's long-held ambition of turning RB into a pure consumer healthcare giant. Mead Johnson was an obvious step in bulking up in that area and there are other assets likely to be up for sale in the near future, most notably the consumer healthcare divisions of Pfizer, which includes the Advil, Centrum and Chapstick brands. Merck, another pharma giant, is also thought to be mulling the sale of its consumer healthcare arm, which makes Seven Seas vitamins and Sangobion, the iron supplement. Mr Kapoor insisted today it was too soon to say if RB will bid for either, but is known to be keen. He said integrating either would not be a concern. But RB will not have the field to itself. Nestle has also expressed an interest in bulking up in consumer healthcare, reasoning that, like RB, it is probably better-placed to distribute and sell such products than the big drug companies, which in most - but not all - cases are seeking to focus on their science and on their more profitable pharmaceutical products. It promises to be an interesting 18 months or so in the sector."

The victory is likely to strengthen Mr Abe's resolve to tackle North Korea's nuclear threat after it fired two missiles over Japan in a month. Mr Abe, 63, whose country is a key US ally in the battle to rein in Pyongyang, said: ""As I promised in the election, my imminent task is to firmly deal with North Korea. For that, strong diplomacy is required."" According to the top-selling Yomiuri daily, Mr Abe was set for a ""landslide win"" as his gamble to hold a snap election appeared to pay off. However, it was not clear whether his coalition would retain its two-thirds ""supermajority,"" requiring 310 seats, as some media had it falling just short. A ""supermajority"" would allow Mr Abe to propose changes to pacifist Japan's US-imposed constitution that forces it to renounce war which limits its military to a self-defence role. Mr Abe said he would ""deepen"" debate on the divisive issue in parliament and said: ""I don't plan to propose changes via the ruling bloc alone. We'll make efforts to gain support from as many people as possible."" The vote came as torrential rain and severe winds from Typhoon Lan battered the country, forcing many to vote early. Two people were killed and one is missing, as parts of the country experienced mudslides and flooding Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) benefited from the weakness of the two opposition parties being formed just weeks before polling day. Support fizzled out for the Party of Hope founded by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and it was on track to win around 50 seats, the TBS projection suggested. Speaking from Paris where she was attending an event in her capacity as leader of the world's biggest city, Ms Koike told public broadcaster NHK she feared a ""very severe result"". She added: ""As the person who launched the party, I will take responsibility."" The new centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party performed slightly better than expected, but still trailed far behind Mr Abe with 58 seats. The economy and the global crisis over North Korea dominated the 12-day campaign. North Korea has threatened to ""sink"" Japan into the sea and became embroiled in a war of words with US President Donald Trump. Mr Abe took a hard-edged stance throughout the campaign and insisted that Japan ""would not waiver"" despite increasing belligerence from Pyongyang. The economy became a priority for many voters who feel Mr Abe's growth policy has left them behind. Pensioner Hideki Kawasaki, 67, said: ""Neither pensions nor wages are getting better ... I don't feel the economy is recovering at all."""

However, the Academy, it seems, felt pressured to react to the dozens of stars who were ""shocked and disgusted"" by his alleged behaviour, and on Sunday announced it was banning the film mogul. The group, which has more than 8,000 members, said the film producer ""does not merit the respect of his colleagues"". :: Hollywood's PR machine and its secret scandal BAFTA was even swifter, making the announcement just five days after the New York Times published its first expose. ""While BAFTA has previously been a beneficiary of Mr Weinstein's support for its charitable work, it considers the reported alleged behaviour completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA's values,"" the organisation said.

Twenty-five years later, he won both best director and best film for The Pianist at the BAFTA awards. He also won best director at the Oscars. Whatever problems these institutions have with the Weinstein claims, they didn't have with Polanski. The British Film Institute was not as quick to condemn Weinstein, but has now withdrawn the fellowship awarded to him in 2002. ""Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" the BFI said in a statement. ""Everyone working in the film industry - in any industry - should be safe and respected in the workplace."" By acting like this, of both judge and jury of accused filmmakers, actors or producers, film institutions risk being dragged into the spotlight by the industry and the media. The most sensible thing to do would be to write up a code of conduct for members to protect actors from casting couch-type situations. The BFI has now promised to do so, incorporating it in its diversity standards. They should wait for court proceedings, if any, to be over to make any sort of decision regarding members - or risk fuelling a lynch mob-like mentality, with subjects trialled by their peers and social media before they are even charged with an offence. Granted, Weinstein could end up facing a jury one day, and I'm certainly not defending him - but we shouldn't be treating him as a criminal either. Not yet, anyway."

2017-10-24,"It's 5am, midwinter, on a bitterly cold morning in the Midlands.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/modern-slave-family-rescued-in-dead-of-night-11095982,"I've arranged to meet investigators from the charity Hope for Justice at a secret location, their hub. For days the team has been planning the rescue of a whole family suspected to be the victims of modern-day slavery. Operations like this, conducted by the charity, are meticulous. There are carefully set up meetings with victims in advance and rescues are timed for when their exploiters are not around. Surveillance is also sometimes carried out to determine how risky the location is, and the individuals involved. When we arrive we are briefed by Peter and John, who ask for their identities to be protected because their work puts them at risk from traffickers. They explain to me that the victims they recover usually do not want to engage with the police. ""They have complete distrust in authority, in anyone really,"" Peter says. That is why the charity is, in effect, filling a gap that law enforcement simply cannot. Peter, who is a Polish outreach worker for the charity, says they plan to first ""secure the place and make sure everyone is safe - then we are going to take the family with us."" ""All their belongings are ready,"" he says. ""Everything is packed. We will then move them to a safe place where we can interview them."" Myself and cameraman Martin jump into a car driven by Peter, while his colleague John, a former police officer and now investigator for the charity, follows behind in a van. Under cover of darkness we pull up alongside a street lit dimly by overhead lamps illuminating a lone woman who stands next to a suitcase. Peter jumps out and introduces us very briefly. Her name is Agnieczka and she's from Poland. Her husband Rafal and their two young children are waiting in an upstairs flat nearby. The stairwell is run down and dirty, there is rubbish on the floor in the hallway and it's dark and dank. When we enter a flat on a higher floor, we are immediately faced with two crying children: Oliwia, aged two, and one-year-old Brian. John tries to put everyone at ease by saying ""good morning"" in Polish. ""Dzien dobry"", he says, before telling the children: ""No need to be frightened now, okay?"" There is urgency now because we need to leave the area quickly. The traffickers, as Peter describes them, visit every day and could arrive at any minute. Agnieczka, Rafal, Oliwia and Brian haul their whole lives, contained in just a few bags, down the stairs in silence. Outside on the street, as Peter and John pack the van, they tell me that the exploiter has been controlling the victims ""on a daily basis"". ""We know that he has a couple of friends who are quite dangerous members of the community and because of the kids we want to make it as smooth as possible,"" Peter says. ""We don't want to take any unnecessary risks so we want to be out of here as quick as possible."" Later, at a secret and safe location, Peter and John interview the family to establish what exactly has been happening to them. Throughout the rescue I've been struggling to understand how two adults were able to be brought under the complete control of another, to the extent where their life is not their own. They have reached the point where, as a family unit, they have been surviving on £10 a week each for months. They have become reliant on soup kitchens and foodbanks, which is where Peter originally came into contact with them. They say their exploiter has been stealing their meagre wages and child benefit every month. ""Our first priority was our kids,"" Rafal says. ""We were worried for their safety - were always looking through the window and looking at the phone. When I don't answer he would call us 15 times a day. ""I wouldn't call that a life. I was afraid to go out on the street."" The family came to the UK looking for work and a better life for their children but struggled with permanent employment and accumulated some debts. They were approached by a fellow Polish national at a library asking if they could use their address as a postal drop to help them get a GP appointment. Agnieczka agreed, and she tells us that is where things started to escalate. Within a few weeks, more and more letters were being posted to the family home. Agnieczka and Rafal were then introduced to one particular man who started making increasing demands. Agnieczka says she was forced to open fake bank accounts by the man who, she claims, also stole their identity cards and national insurance numbers. John, from the charity, tells me that the family have been ""controlled psychologically"" and are also the victims of ""forced criminality"". Rafal says: ""I was afraid of him and I didn't know what to say to the police and I didn't know what he would do if he found out."" It's an unusual case that John deems to be modern-day slavery. The family are then presented with a choice. They can be referred on to the Salvation Army for a phone call assessment to decide if they qualify for the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), or report their case to the police. The NRM is a government programme that helps set slavery victims up in safe houses. They opt to report to the police because, as Rafal says, ""he had no right to lock up my children and take away our documents"". After giving a statement to the police the family are then referred on to the NRM and housed hundreds of miles away in a safe house, where they have begun a new life. The Hope for Justice team in the Midlands, Zoe's Hub, is mostly made up of former police officers who have experience investigating exploitation. I spoke to Gary Booth, a retired detective who leads the team, who says while it is unusual to come across whole family units as victims, it's not unheard of. ""From a trafficker's perspective they look at a family as a commodity and each member of that family is a means of earning money, illegitimate money,"" he tells me. ""He has dehumanised the parents and clearly that has a knock on effect with the children. One of their parting comments to my colleagues today was that their life hasn't been worth living for the past six months."" Not all rescues carried out by Hope for Justice are so dramatic or take place in the early hours of the morning, but most, more than 80%, are for victims of forced labour. Shortly after this rescue, there is another, and then another. Over a number of months we accompany the team on further operations. Witnessing their work the reality hits me: this is 2017 Britain, and we are far from having a grip on this crisis. The ""human conveyor belt of slavery"" the charity describes to me is reflected in the continuous rescues they carry out. It's clear that the true scale of modern day slavery is far greater than anyone realises. Victims are hidden away and many cases are complex. Ultimately the line between exploitation and slavery is blurred. Perhaps that is why many of these victims appear to be slipping through the cracks."

Winchester Crown Court was read WhatsApp messages the lovers exchanged after as Victoria Cilliers, who was injured in a 4,000ft fall when her parachute failed, was undergoing surgery in hospital with a fractured spine, pelvis, and broken ribs. Responding to the suggestion, Ms Goller replied: ""Haha I like naked cooking ;)"". When Cilliers replied: ""Ooo cool. Apart from the splashback"", she said: ""I will wear an apron and an apron only"". ""I might get distracted and you'll end up being distracted by me and then burn the cooking,"" Cilliers warned. He also wrote to Ms Goller: ""One day we might have a family of our own."" The court was also read text messages in which Cilliers described to Ms Goller his wife's injuries, which he stands accused of causing by tampering with the parachute. He denies the charges against him. ""She will have difficulty and will probably walk with a limp for the rest of her life,"" he wrote. ""She was in tears last night saying all she could think of is she didn't say goodbye to the kids."" The prosecution allege that Cilliers, a fitness instructor, twisted the lines of his wife's main parachute and removed links, causing the parachute to spiral out of control and his wife to plummet to the ground in April 2015. The defendant was £22,000 in debt and believed he would get a £120,000 insurance payout when his wife died, the court heard. He is also accused of tampering with a gas valve in the couple's home as part of a second murder attempt. Mrs Cilliers is one of the top parachutists in the country, and her husband had taken a packing course before the alleged attempt, the court was told. She survived the fall, but suffered severe injuries. In other messages, Ms Goller and Cilliers plan a life and a holiday in Honduras together, and the fitness instructor promised to ""sacrifice and give up so much"" for his lover. Ms Goller also said she loved Mr Cilliers in uniform. He responded: ""You going onto salute me?"" to which she said: ""I guess sometimes I will have to obey you."" Mr Cilliers was also in a sexual relationship with his ex-wife, Carly Cilliers, the prosecution said. The trial was adjourned until Tuesday."

But the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said 384,000 customer lending agreements were found that ""may not have been affordable"" and payments ""which should have been refunded"" between 2010 and 2016. The regulator hit out at the firm's lending application affordability assessment and collections processes, saying they ""did not always deliver good outcomes for customers, particularly those who were at a higher risk of falling into financial difficulty"". As a result of the failures, the FCA said 81,000 customers, covering 114,000 transactions, who were not properly assessed and had since handed back the goods would be repaid the interest and fees they were charged. It said those people would also get 8% in compensatory interest. Those people who retained the products they initially rented would have their balances written off, the watchdog said. It added that BrightHouse had agreed refunds and compensatory interest of 8% to 181,000 customers who had made the first payment due under an agreement with the firm which was cancelled prior to delivery of the goods.

2017-10-24,Is one of Britain's largest companies preparing to break itself in two?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/durex-splits-from-brasso-and-cillit-bang-in-group-shake-up-at-rb-11086813,"That is the conclusion from the news that consumer goods giant RB, formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, is reorganising itself into two divisions. One division, RB Health, takes in heathcare brands including Neurofen, Strepsils, Gaviscon, Clearasil and Dettol, as well as 'lifestyle' brands such as Durex, Scholl and Veet. The second, RB Hygiene Home, will own household products brands such as Air Wick, Finish, Calgon, Mr Sheen, Vanish, Brasso and Cillit Bang. This is a big shake-up for the UK's 13th-largest company, which was formed by the 1999 merger between British firm Reckitt & Colman with the Dutch company Benckiser. With a stock market value of just under £50bn, RB is a vast business that, during the last decade or so, has made a number of shrewd acquisitions of assets that it successfully identified as having good growth prospects - then managed them more aggressively than their existing owners. These included the old Boots Healthcare business in 2005, which brought in Strepsils and Neurofen; the 2008 acquisition of Adams Healthcare, which brought in Mucinex and the 2010 takeover of SSL, which added Scholl and Durex. The biggest roll of the dice came when, earlier this year, RB announced it was splashing out $16.7bn for the US baby milk maker Mead Johnson. Some businesses have been offloaded along the way, including the famous Colman's mustard brand, but most notably Indivior, a provider of opioids to people seeking to lose their heroin addiction, which was floated off in 2014. Following the Mead Johnson deal, RB also announced plans to sell its remaining food brands, including the French's mustard business. Announcing the move, RB said: ""The two business units will together form one RB - a single company devoted to delivering on our mission of creating healthier lives and happier homes."" Yet this separation of the two businesses will inevitably lead to speculation RB plans to float off its Hygiene Home arm which, accounting for 40% of sales, is the smaller of the two divisions. Adding fuel to this is that Rakesh Kapoor, RB's chief executive, will be personally heading RB Health. There is a logic to the reorganisation. Along with other consumer goods giants like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, RB is wrestling both with changing consumer habits and tastes, including disruption from internet start-ups that sell direct to the consumer and competition from supermarket own brands. All at a time when the rising price of commodities like palm oil, a key ingredient, are rising. A more formal break-up would undoubtedly be welcomed. Investors have started to fret that sales growth has stalled at RB - concerns accentuated today when RB admitted that, during the three months to the end of September, sales were down 1% on the same period on a like-for-like basis. Analysts had been expecting growth during the quarter. Adding to those worries have been a string of setbacks, including a cyberattack in June this year and an earlier scandal in South Korea involving the sale of a humidifier disinfectant linked to the deaths of more than 100 people. This has got some shareholders worrying that, given RB's well-known efficiency, whether it has been 'running too hot' or, at the very least, whether it can carry on growing profits further in a climate in which sales growth is flagging and in which it has few obvious cost cuts left to make. Adding to that unease was the sudden departure, last month, of four of the 10 members of RB's executive committee. Demerging Hygiene Home would also fit with what is thought to be Mr Kapoor's long-held ambition of turning RB into a pure consumer healthcare giant. Mead Johnson was an obvious step in bulking up in that area and there are other assets likely to be up for sale in the near future, most notably the consumer healthcare divisions of Pfizer, which includes the Advil, Centrum and Chapstick brands. Merck, another pharma giant, is also thought to be mulling the sale of its consumer healthcare arm, which makes Seven Seas vitamins and Sangobion, the iron supplement. Mr Kapoor insisted today it was too soon to say if RB will bid for either, but is known to be keen. He said integrating either would not be a concern. But RB will not have the field to itself. Nestle has also expressed an interest in bulking up in consumer healthcare, reasoning that, like RB, it is probably better-placed to distribute and sell such products than the big drug companies, which in most - but not all - cases are seeking to focus on their science and on their more profitable pharmaceutical products. It promises to be an interesting 18 months or so in the sector."
2017-10-24,An ex-HSBC banker has been found guilty by a US jury of defrauding an energy company in a $3.5bn currency trade in 2011.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/ex-hsbc-banker-found-guilty-by-us-jury-in-fraud-case-11095760,"Prosecutors said British citizen Mark Johnson, former head of the bank's global foreign exchange cash trading desk, plotted to ramp up the price of sterling before executing a trade for Cairn Energy - making millions for the lender at the company's expense. The 51-year-old was the first banker to be tried in the US as a result of worldwide investigations into the wider multi-trillion dollar per day currency market. Investigations into this market have led to about $10bn in fines against several banks and the firing of dozens of traders. John Wing, a lawyer for Johnson, 51, said following the verdict in a New York federal court: ""They've convicted an innocent man"" According to court filings, Cairn hired HSBC in 2011 to convert $3.5bn into pounds in connection with the sale of an Indian subsidiary. Prosecutors said Johnson and another former HSBC executive, Stuart Scott, who is also facing charges, devised a scheme to drive up sterling by executing a series of trades before carrying out the trade for Cairn. The practice of such trading in advance of executing a client's order is known as ""front-running"". During the trial, jurors heard tape-recorded phone calls between Johnson and Scott discussing the trade. A lawyer for Scott, who is in Britain and fighting extradition, declined to comment. A spokesman for HSBC in London declined to comment."
2017-10-24,The AA is demanding that its ousted former chairman repays more than £1.2m in bonuses over an allegation that he was involved in a public altercation that was not previously disclosed to its board.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/aa-demands-ousted-chairman-mckenzie-repays-12m-in-bonuses-11096277,"Sky News has learnt that lawyers for the UK's biggest breakdown recovery service have written to Bob Mackenzie requesting that he hands back his annual bonuses for 2016 and 2017. People close to the situation said that the AA's letter to Mr Mackenzie, who was dismissed by the AA for ""gross misconduct"" in July, referred to an earlier bust-up in a public place which it argued provided grounds for clawing back the payments. The individual said to have been involved in the earlier altercation is not thought to have been an AA employee. Mr Mackenzie's lawyers are expected to dispute the AA's efforts to force him to repay the bonuses. The company's annual report for this year discloses that Mr Mackenzie was paid an annual bonus in 2016 of about £700,000 and approximately £500,000 the following year. His contract had entitled him to bonus payments in each year up to a maximum of £900,000. Mr Mackenzie left the company during the summer after a row in the bar of a country hotel with Michael Lloyd, the head of its insurance arm, turned into a physical conflict. It subsequently emerged that Mr Lloyd and other members of the AA's board were keen to explore a merger of its insurance business with Hastings, a listed group - a move opposed by Mr Mackenzie. The former AA chairman was hospitalised after the encounter with Mr Lloyd, and has been publicly described by his son as receiving treatment for mental health issues. Mr Mackenzie was responsible for bringing the AA to the London stock market in 2014, but has since been wrestling with a heavily indebted balance sheet and no obvious means to grow profits sufficiently quickly to materially reduce its borrowings. The dispute over his past bonuses is not the only contentious legal issue relating to Mr Mackenzie's departure from the company. He also participated in a potentially lucrative reward scheme which is due to pay out depending upon returns to shareholders during the five years after its flotation. However, the weak performance of the AA's shares have cast doubt over whether that scheme will pay out material sums. On Tuesday, shares in the AA were trading at 160p, meaning they have fallen by more than a third over the last 12 months. The company now has a market value of less than £1bn, a figure dwarfed by its debt pile. Spokesmen for the AA and Mr Mackenzie declined to comment."

""With a good deal, no deal or no Brexit,"" Mr Tusk added, in a report to the European Parliament on last week's gathering of EU leaders in Brussels. At the summit, the other 27 EU member states refused to sanction the second phase of Brexit negotiations - on a possible post-Brexit trade deal and transitional arrangements - but agreed to begin their own internal preparatory talks on the subject. In his statement to MEPs, Mr Tusk hailed the EU27's unity over Brexit and urged countries to remain together during the next segment of talks in order to ""protect our common interest"". ""We have managed to build and maintain unity among the 27,"" he said. ""But ahead of us is still the toughest stress test. If we fail it, the negotiations will end in our defeat. ""We must keep our unity regardless of the direction of the talks. ""The EU will be able to rise to every scenario as long as we are not divided."" :: UK will get Canada-style deal with EU - Barnier Senior UK politicians such as Nick Clegg and Tony Blair have called for a second EU referendum once the detail of Britain's future relationship becomes clear. It is legally unknown whether Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the legal mechanism for EU departure triggered by the Prime Minister in April - is reversible, but it has been suggested political will in both the UK and Brussels could see the decision revoked. The UK Government has consistently ruled out holding a fresh vote on EU membership and insisted Britain will leave the bloc in March 2019. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable welcomed Mr Tusk's comments. ""No matter what Theresa May says there are still three options on the table. No deal, a deal, or no Brexit,"" he said. ""The EU have confirmed what we have been saying all along, if Brexit looks like a disaster we can call the whole thing off."""

""All of a sudden, a big bang from the bottom and a shark had taken me. Not that I knew it was a shark,"" she told the Nine Network. ""Next thing I knew I was in the water with the shark and I was watching it attack my kayak. ""When I was in the air - because it threw me up in the air - it felt like I was watching the typical Jaws movie. ""I saw it when I was in the water with it. I saw what it was and I saw its fin."" Her father Chris and brother Mitchell Clarke-Williams looked on in horror as they saw the shark thrashing about and lunging at the kayak as the teenager screamed. Mr Williams said: ""All of a sudden this awful sound of something hitting the plastic of the kayak. I had my back to her. ""I've turn around and I see Sarah hit the water, because it has launched her out of the water, he's come up and hit from underneath."" Fighting back tears, he continued: ""This scream. You can't describe. You cannot describe what this scream was like. ""So I just turned around, pulled the motor - thank God it started the first pull - and I just hit it as hard as I can straight back to her. ""The shark's come back and had another go at her, thrashing around, and she's screaming and trying to get back onto the kayak."" Her family got to her as soon as they could and her brother pulled her out of the water, dragging her across the shark's back, between its nose and dorsal fin, into their boat. Mr Williams said if the rescue had taken 10 seconds longer she would have been dead. ""It's something I don't ever want to experience again. To hear the spine-chilling screams from your daughter is indescribable,"" he added. The teenager suffered shock and escaped the ordeal with minor cuts and bruises. She said there were ""tears"" and ""cuddles"" for everyone afterwards, adding she was ""thankful that I'm here""."
2017-10-24,Northern Ireland's strict abortion law will be scrutinised by the UK's highest court today.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/supreme-court-considers-northern-irelands-abortion-law-11095992,"The Supreme Court will hear the claim that barring victims of sexual crimes and women carrying foetuses with fatal abnormalities from terminations breaches human rights. Abortion is illegal in Northern Ireland unless there is a direct threat to the mother's life. It means women have to travel abroad for the procedure to avoid breaking the law. Amnesty International is one of the groups supporting the challenge. Spokesperson Grainne Teggart told Sky News: ""I've been working with women who in very difficult circumstance have had to board a plane, away from their families and friends to access healthcare they should be entitled to here at home. ""Travelling only adds to the trauma that women experience and politicians have for too long been shirking their responsibilities to women which is why we've had to take our fight to the courts."" In 2015, Belfast's high court ruled the law breached the rights of women in cases of fatal abnormalities, or women who were pregnant following rape or incest. That ruling was overturned in June 2017, so the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is taking its case to the Supreme Court. Liam Gibson, from Northern Ireland's Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, believes the current law should remain. ""Abortion is not healthcare,"" he said. ""It's an act of lethal violence directed at an unborn child. ""That child is innocent regardless of the circumstances of his or her conception, regardless of his disabilities or imperfections and we're hoping the Supreme Court will uphold the decision made by the court of appeal in Belfast."" 724 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for abortion care in 2016. Sarah Ewart had to make the same journey several years ago after being told her baby had a fatal defect and wouldn't survive birth. She believes women's lives are being put at risk. ""It's not about being pro-life or pro-choice, it's about a medical procedure and it's about giving a woman the help when she decides she can't carry on with her pregnancy,"" she said. The hearing is expected to last three days."

Angie Blannin said she last spoke to him at the weekend, discussing how he would hopefully be home for Christmas. Fighting in every major battle, he had been surrounded by IS fighters at times, Mrs Blannin said of her only child. Nevertheless, his battle injuries had been limited to a gunshot wound to his arm and three cracked ribs. Last week, the Syrian Democratic Forces, made up of Kurdish and Arab fighters, said military operations had ended in Islamic State's former de facto capital in Syria. Mr Holmes, a former painter and decorator with no previous military experience, was killed on Monday. Kurdish officials said he had been clearing mines to help civilians. Despite details being sketchy, Mrs Blannin said she was ""guessing he stepped on a landmine or one went off close to him, or it was a suicide vest"". ""But I don't know,"" she added. ""It was an IED - that probably covers every base."" :: Raqqa broken in every sense after Islamic State occupation Mrs Blannin said she was ""extremely proud"" of her son, who thought the West should have been doing more to fight Islamic State. ""He felt that it was not just a Syrian problem, or Middle Eastern problem, it was a world problem,"" she explained. ""He wanted to go and do something about that and not just be a keyboard warrior."" Mrs Blannin was ""completely shocked"" when her son announced he was going to fight IS. ""This was the boy who liked a nice bed, and a nice pillow,"" she said. ""When he first went there I thought he would probably last about six weeks ... and he will want to come home. ""But he stuck it, and he loved it. ""I think it made him. He learnt the language - he spoke fluent Kurdish - he integrated very well and had so much respect from the commanders and his peers."" Mrs Blannin added: ""He was a boy when he went, but my God, he definitely died a man and I am extremely proud of him. ""All my family are incredibly proud."""
2017-10-24,Residents of a usually quiet Florida neighbourhood have been warned not to walk alone at night as police investigate three shootings they believe are linked.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/florida-residents-fear-serial-killer-after-shootings-in-tampa-11096000,"The three people - two men and a woman - were shot and killed seemingly at random in the past two weeks. Detectives say the shootings are linked by proximity and time frame but they do not have a suspect or a motive. All three victims took the bus and were alone when they were shot within a one mile radius on the streets of the Seminole Heights area of Tampa. They were not robbed and they did not know each other, police said. The two men were black and the woman was white. Benjamin Edward Mitchell, 22, was shot and killed on 9 October at around 9pm. He had been waiting at a bus stop outside his home. Monica Caridad Hoffa, 32, was shot and killed and her body found early on 13 October in an empty car park about half a mile away from where Mr Mitchell was killed. Police think she was killed at some point during the previous few days. Anthony Naiboa, 20, became the third victim on Thursday night. Mr Naiboa, who had autism, had got on the wrong bus after work and ended up in the same area as the other two victims. The Tampa Bay Times reported that police have been escorting children to school bus stops in the morning to keep them safe. Tonight men and women from across the @CityofTampa joined in prayer for the victims who lost their lives due to these awful shootings. 🙏🏼 pic.twitter.com/L6Y1jfwQY2 A meeting was held for residents on Monday night so they could hear from police and Tampa City's mayor Bob Buckhorn. On Twitter after the meeting, Mr Buckhorn wrote: ""For the men and women in the (Tampa Police Department) this is personal and were not going to stop until we catch this guy ""We're not leaving until we catch this guy but we need you to turn those lights on, we need you to tell us what you see. ""We have added over 1,000 streetlights in Seminole Heights. You've seen our men out there. We're not stopping until we catch this guy. ""We can't replace the lives that were taken or replace the holes in some of these families but we can ensure that whoever did this pays."" Interim Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said he did not want residents to feel like they had to stay in their homes. Speaking to 970-WFLA radio, he said: ""We want people outside; this is not a bad neighbourhood. ""We need people outside telling us what's going on."" Asked if the perpetrator could be described as a serial killer, Mr Dugan said: ""We can call it what we want... if that brings attention to it, that's fine."" But he later said the killer ""could be multiple people""."

Mr O'Mara was applauded by Jeremy Corbyn as he told of having been on a journey and changed his views. Among the posts sent between 2002 and 2004, the now Sheffield Hallam MP called gay people ""f****-packers"" and ""p*******"", saying he found it ""funny"" that they ""think they have the monopoly on being subject to abuse"". He also blasted the ""prevailing western tendency to deify fatties"", suggesting Pop Idol contestant Michelle McManus only won the talent show in 2003 ""because she was fat"". And Mr O'Mara called for singer Jamie Cullum to be raped with his own piano. A senior Labour source told Sky News his apology on Monday evening was ""a very brave thing to do, to come to the meeting and stand in front of his fellow Labour MPs and speak in the way he did"". ""He volunteered to come,"" the source said. ""Quite a few MPs praised his courage after he spoke."" ""Everyone who spoke welcomed what he said. It was emotional and powerful. That affected the way people responded. ""He talked about his own experience as a young man, his own journey and his history as a disabled person. The room was silent while he was speaking. You could hear a pin drop."" Other sources said the party leadership did not consider suspending Mr O'Mara because the incidents happened a very long time ago, before he was an MP. They claimed his case was different from those of Simon Danczuk and Naz Shah, who were suspended from the party over recent indiscretions. Another Labour MP described the speech as a ""mea culpa"". After Mr O'Mara spoke he was praised for his honesty and candour by Mr Corbyn, according to party sources. Among those who congratulated him for apologising were Wes Streeting, who previously worked for LGBT campaign group Stonewall, and was endorsed at the 2017 general election by Sir Ian McKellen. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston responded on Twitter after news of Mr O'Mara's resignation: ""Hard to see how anyone with his views was selected and retains the Labour whip. Sheffield Hallam deserves a by-election."" Earlier on Monday, Mr O'Mara said he was ""deeply ashamed"", and made the ""offensive"" comments ""as a young man, at a particularly bad time in my life"". But he had pledged to ""be a better man"" and stay sitting on the equalities committee. Mr O'Mara will remain an MP for Sheffield Hallam, the constituency he unseated former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg from at the 2017 general election."

The clinic confirmed it had been hacked and said it was working to establish exactly what data had been stolen. ""We took measures to block the attack immediately in order to protect patient information and we informed the Metropolitan Police who launched an investigation,"" the clinic told Sky News. London Bridge Plastic Surgery clinic counts former glamour model Katie Price among its clients, as well as many people who are not famous, whose privacy has been threatened by the hackers. The clinic said: ""The group behind the attack are highly sophisticated and well known to international law enforcement agencies having targeted large US medical providers and corporations over the past year. We are horrified that they have now targeted our patients."" A representative of the hacking group who contacted online magazine The Daily Beast claimed to have terabytes of data on victims. ""There are some royal families in here,"" the hackers claimed. They also threatened to publish the stolen images, a common tactic for criminals who are seeking a ransom - although there has been no acknowledgement the group has demanded money from the clinic. ""We're going to pitch it all up for everyone to nab. The entire patient list with corresponding photos. The world has never seen a medical dump of a plastic surgeon to such a degree,"" the group told The Daily Beast.

2017-10-24,"The conviction rate for modern-day slavery offences in England and Wales over the last 2 years stands at just 1.9%, a Sky News investigation has learned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/modern-slavery-conviction-rate-is-less-than-2-11095938,"Of the 17 police forces which held data on convictions, only 25 successful prosecutions were made between April 2015 and March 2017, according to a freedom of information (FOI) request. That was despite a total of 1265 slavery offences reported in those force areas. Across all 38 police forces who responded to the FOI request, crimes recorded under the Modern Slavery Act rose by nearly 200% in two years. Between March 2015 and April 2016 there were 788 offences - the following year 2,347 were recorded. The independent anti-slavery commissioner Kevin Hyland has announced that the scale of modern slavery in the UK is far greater than previously thought. While it was believed there were around 13,000 potential slavery victims in the UK the figure is now thought to be in the ""tens of thousands"", he said. Gary Booth, UK programmes director for the charity Hope for Justice, described the current situation in the UK as ""a human conveyor belt of slavery"". He says that recovering victims from traffickers only ""hits them short term in the pocket"" and unfortunately there are others overseas, in Europe, or the UK ""who will be recruited"" and quickly ""fill that void"". ""Law enforcement agencies are making inroads into disrupting these organised crime groups who just inflict human misery,"" he added. Sky News has also learned that less than half of police forces in England and Wales have a dedicated anti-slavery unit. Most of the forces who do have a unit introduced it within the last two years, since the Modern Slavery Act was introduced in 2015. Hope for Justice has rescued nearly 600 victims of modern slavery to date, often working well with local police forces. The numbers entering the government National Referral Mechanism (NRM), that sets slavery victims up in safe houses to protect them from their exploiters, is also increasing significantly year on year. The National Crime Agency said that last year 4,273 people were referred through the mechanism, with more than 12,000 in total to date. Nigel Osman, a trainer for Hope for Justice, who works with frontline services to spot the signs of slavery, says that ""modern slavery and human trafficking is embedded here in the United Kingdom"". ""It's amongst our communities,"" he said, ""and it could well be in the streets that you live in and you won't even know about it."" There is one common factor amongst victims of slavery: vulnerability. ""If we got parked in the middle of a country where we couldn't speak the language,"" he says, ""and we got spun around 10 times and all of our ID's taken off us. ""If someone then said 'go and survive' - whilst I don't consider myself vulnerable - I would become vulnerable very quickly. ""And if some of these victims have had an existing vulnerability then that just heightens things."" Filip, a victim of forced labour, told Sky News how he felt ""like a bird that has escaped from a cage"" following his rescue. He said he had never heard of the term ""modern slave"" previously but described his time under the control of traffickers ""as like a bit of hell"". ""I can't take it to my head clearly,"" he said, ""I was born a free man""."

Regulators and economists have sounded warnings that the annual rate of growth in that total - at just under 10% - is unsustainable for both consumers and lenders alike - with banks signalling they will cut back. More people have turned to credit in the wake of the Brexit vote amid record low interest rates and pressure on household budgets from rising inflation and weak wage growth. The Treasury said a series of meetings would be held with key industry representatives from charities, debt advice organisations, lenders and creditors to formulate the policy. :: Young people worried about finances The Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay, said: ""For many people in the UK problem debt seems impossible to escape. ""Its effects can be far-reaching, impacting all aspects of a person's life and leaving them feeling helpless. ""That is why we are working to give people who are overwhelmed by debt more time to seek advice, find a workable solution, and help get their lives back on track. ""Although many people can and do use credit successfully to manage their personal finances, for the minority who get into difficulties this government wants to offer more support. ""The new scheme could include legal protections that would shield individuals from further creditor action once a plan to repay their debts is in place."" The Money Advice Trust, the charity behind the National Debtline service, said it welcomed the idea in principle. Its director of external affairs, Jane Tully, said: ""Many banks and credit card companies already offer 'breathing space' by freezing interest and charges as a matter of good practice, but a statutory scheme will extend this significantly."" The Trust said it was ""crucial"" public sector creditors, such as local authorities and HMRC, were included in the scheme alongside private sector lenders."

Theresa May had ruled out a Canada-style deal in her Florence speech last month. Mr Barnier also claimed it would be ""several years"" before a Brexit trade deal was agreed - another blow to Mrs May, who told the House of Commons on Monday that the UK would ""need to know"" the terms of its future relationship before any transition period was fully agreed. Speaking to French newspaper Les Echoes, Mr Barnier said a transitional period would ""leave us more time to prepare for the future relationship"", as he raised the prospect of Brexit talks lasting well beyond the UK's formal departure. ""The two phases are difficult. The second will be very different and will last several years,"" he said. ""It is truly unique because instead of promoting regulatory convergence, it will aim to frame a difference. ""It will involve risks, including about its political ratification, making all the more necessary transparency around these topics."" On whether a transition deal was now a certainty, Mr Barnier said: ""If we reach an agreement on the orderly withdrawal of the UK, such a period, both short and framed, is possible. ""To my mind, it makes sense that it covers the financial period, so until 2020."" :: Theresa May 'ducks' timetable for Brexit transition deal Brexit talks are currently deadlocked as the EU looks to extract a ""firm and concrete commitment"" from the UK on a financial settlement, with Mr Barnier refusing to start talks on trade until a divorce bill is agreed. However, EU leaders have started preparatory internal discussions on a future relationship with the UK."

It is understood that no official visits or public engagements are currently planned to mark the milestone. The news came as the Queen made a solo visit to the warship HMS Sutherland which was docked in London, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the vessel's commissioning. She met with the crew of a Wildcat Helicopter who were part of the Royal Navy's relief effort in the aftermath of Caribbean Hurricane Irma. She couldn't resist pressing the old fashioned fire horn worn by one of the firefighters on board HMS Sutherland. Chief Petty Officer Peter Manning, 38, who is in charge of the fire crew, laughed with the royal visitor as she prodded the horn. He said later: ""The Queen asked what it was for and I told her they sound it in distress. If they get into a distress situation during firefighting - it could be dark with smoke - it lets others know they need help."" For their 60th wedding anniversary in 2007 official photographs were released and a service of thanksgiving was held at Westminster Abbey. To mark 50 years of marriage in 1997 the Queen and Prince Philip attended a lunch at Banqueting House in London. :: 'Conflict' likely among staff as Royal Family enters a new era In a speech the Queen spoke of ""a remarkable 50 years"", and paid tribute to her husband. She said at the time: ""He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know."" The Palace wouldn't comment on why they have decided to spend the anniversary privately this year, but it comes as Prince Philip, who is 96, has now retired from royal duties, and only occasionally appears publicly alongside his wife. The Queen, who is 91, is still carrying out a full programme of audiences and engagements, but she is increasingly being supported by younger members of the family. It was announced that she has asked Prince Charles to lay her wreath at the cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday this year. Her Majesty will watch the service from the Foreign and Commonwealth office balcony with the Duke of Edinburgh."
2017-10-24,The Foreign Secretary has called on North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un to negotiate over his nuclear ambitions but warned the rogue state a pre-emptive strike remains a possibility.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/johnson-calls-on-kim-jong-un-to-negotiate-over-nuclear-ambitions-11094851,"Boris Johnson said he backed a series of ""commitments"" made by South Korea and the US secretary of state's efforts to talk, making it clear the UK did not seek to bring about regime change. He told the Chatham House conference in London: ""These are the commitments that we hope will encourage Kim Jong Un to halt his nuclear development programme, to come to the negotiating table and thereby to take the only path that can guarantee the security of the region as a whole."" The Trump administration's top diplomat, Rex Tillerson, has been attempting to negotiate with Pyongyang to stop it carrying out tests of long-range missiles and nuclear devices. Mr Johnson said ""no one... in the UK or even around the world wants any kind of military solution"" to North Korea's nuclear threat. However, he said Mr Kim ""and the world"" should understand that in the face of a ""regime led by a man who not only threatens to reduce New York to ashes, but who stands of the verge of acquiring the power to make good on his threat"", the US President would ""have an absolute duty to keep safe not only the American people but all those who have sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella"". In a later question and answer session, Mr Johnson responded to a question from Sky News' Alistair Bunkall on whether he could foresee any circumstances in which the UK would support a pre-emptive strike by the US by saying: ""It must remain on the table. ""There is a spectrum of things that could be done. It is the duty of any President of the United States, given the threat that his or her country could face, to at least explore those military options."" Mr Johnson had used an earlier part of his speech to extol the success of the Iran treaty, called the joint comprehensive plan of action, which he said stood to avert a ""perilous and debilitating arms race"". He went on to add: ""In short, Pyongyang faces the same dilemma as Tehran. By continuing to develop nuclear weapons Kim risks provoking a reaction in the region that is at once defensive and competitive, that reduces not increases his security (and) the survival chances of his regime... ""Until he understands that, I feel we have no choice but to step up the pressure on Pyongyang."" Mr Johnson said, amid the ""urgent"" need for China to ""address"" the problem of North Korea, there is ""unprecedented discussion between China and the US on how to handle this crisis"", a closeness he said boded well for the future. ""Whatever we think of the regime and its behaviour, the ruling elite in North Korea is in the end composed of human beings. We must find ways of getting through to them but at the same time, not just toughening the sanctions regime, enforcing those in place. ""It won't be easy, but the costs of failure could be catastrophic."" In stating why, he underlined why he felt the UK's nuclear arsenal remained necessary, harking back to Britain's role in negotiating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the late 1960s. ""To wield a nuclear deterrent as this country does, is neither easy nor cheap... We are one of the handful specifically recognised by the NPT to possess such dreadful weapons... and by holding that stockpile, we play our part in deterring the ambitions of rogue states."""
2017-10-24,"Tenants who were part of a trial of the incoming Universal Credit scheme ""universally... experienced financial hardship"", according to a report.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171024123826/http://news.sky.com/story/universal-credit-claimants-in-trial-roll-out-suffering-hardship-11095442,"The report by The Smith Institute found 36% of the total rent owed by those studied was not paid after the scheme was introduced in Southwark and Croydon. The study found arrears built up most quickly in the first few weeks after Universal Credit (UC) was introduced. The Smith Institute studied the rent accounts of 775 tenants with the Peabody and Family Mosaic housing associations to give a ""quantitative understanding of how rent behaviours were changing"". A further 36 in-depth telephone interviews and four focus groups were conducted with tenants by the research company BritainThinks to understand what happened to them once they were on UC. The Government has been under pressure to cut the period time it takes before it pays the benefits owed to people in receipt of UC after criticism they are being left in difficulty. It is currently making claimants wait six weeks before they get any benefits, leaving Labour and SNP MPs to tell Parliament in a debate last week food banks would need tons more food to cope with the demand. The roll-out of the scheme is under way but it is being trialled first before being fully implemented sometime after the start of 2018. The qualitative research found: ""Associations with UC are generally negative, and are primarily driven by claimants' direct experiences of the transition process - specifically delayed payments. ""Claimants describe both positive and negative experiences of the UC application process. However, there are clear issues in terms of how quickly claimants receive payment. ""Delayed UC payments have put many into debt and rent arrears, causing considerable stress to individuals. ""Claimants use a range of strategies to cope financially, with many relying on friends and family (though this is not an option for everyone). ""Many are struggling to manage their finances on UC - for some it's adapting to a single monthly payment, but for others it's simply 'not having enough money to get by'."" The conclusion of the research was that the principle of UC's introduction was less of an issue than the process - a finding that has ""significant implications for council(s and) the wellbeing of the individuals themselves, many of whom have desperate personal stories to tell"", the Safe As Houses report said. Iain Duncan Smith, the man in charge of the Department of Work and Pensions when universal credit was conceived in 2013, said during a debate in Parliament the scheme's opponents were ""scaremongering"". The minister responsible for its implementation, David Gauke, who last week said call charges to the welfare helpline would be scrapped, defended the programme. The report came as Crossbench peer Baroness Meacher told the Lords the roll-out of universal credit was leading to ""unprecedented"" levels of debt and that some people were ""resorting to burglary in order to pay their debts""."
2017-10-25,One of these days we might stop caring about Gross Domestic Product (GDP).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/interest-rate-rise-looms-next-month-after-lift-in-economic-growth-11097838,"After all, it is difficult to know where to begin with the statistic's flaws. While it is the broadest measure of economic performance (at least, the broadest measure available within a few months) it is still disappointingly narrow. It is blind to social performance, it notches up natural disasters as economic boosts and takes little account of innovation, new products, inequality, the sharing economy and other social yardsticks. :: Economic growth accelerates in third quarter And who knows: perhaps in future we will be focusing on a totally different measure of growth, such as the ones proposed by Diane Coyle, Benjamin Mitra-Kahn and Jonathan Haskel for the Indigo Prize on finding a replacement for GDP. In the meantime, though, GDP is what matters. It is GDP which hogs the headlines. It is GDP which many people view as the ultimate yardstick of whether Britain is in recession (two successive quarters of shrinking GDP equals a recession - at least according to the conventional wisdom). It is GDP which most politicians fixate on when they're looking for a measure of how well the economy is doing. So what's the answer: how well is it doing? The answer is: well, it depends. On the one hand, the figures are stronger than had been expected by economists, who had been anticipating growth of just 0.3%. Moreover, save for the construction sector, which had a dismal quarter (but is quite volatile at the best of times), this was pretty broad based growth. The manufacturing and services sectors are both growing - though the latter, which contributes about 80% of total GDP, is still growing at well below its historical rate - 0.4%, compared with 0.8% in the years before the financial crisis. And that brings us to the broader concern. While these figures are stronger than the City had expected, they are nonetheless, considerably weaker than the UK's normal, trend rate of expansion. Normally you'd hope for the economy to grow by about 0.7% a quarter. It hasn't achieved anything like that since late 2015. Indeed, these figures mean Britain has had the worst three quarters since 2013, and the worst first three quarters of a calendar year since 2009. One question economists will be asking themselves is whether this is the new normal: is Britain transitioning to a lower normal rate of growth? If so, that would have enormous consequences for all of us. Weak growth means less income shared among us, which means less prosperity and (a worry for the Chancellor) less tax revenue. And less tax revenue in turn means the potential for more austerity. A final consequence of the stronger-than-expected numbers is the implications for monetary policy. At present the majority of economists and investors expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 0.5% at their meeting next week - the first increase since the financial crisis. The fact that GDP is going up faster than anticipated will only increase the likelihood - after all, a stronger economy implies more inflation which puts pressure on the Monetary Policy Committee - to lift interest rates."
2017-10-25,Two Snapchat posts by reality television star Marnie Simpson have fallen foul of advertising standards for failing to clearly indicate they were sponsored.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/reality-tv-star-marnie-simpson-in-snapchat-controversy-as-posts-breached-ad-code-11097678,"The posts in June showed Simpson holding a Diamond Whites tooth polish product close to her face with the text ""50% off everything from Diamond Whites"" and an image of her wearing grey contact lenses. Following complaints about both snaps, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) investigated and has ruled they potentially misled her fans about the nature of her relationship with the products. The watchdog found Ms Simpson had uploaded snaps of products from firms she had commercial relationships with without telling her followers. Strict regulations prohibit stars like Ms Simpson, who has featured in Geordie Shore and Celebrity Big Brother, engaging in ""hidden"" advertising on social media. Simpson, 25, has been a brand ambassador for Diamond Whites - a tooth polish cosmetics company - for two years. Her management agency also sells coloured contact lenses under the name ""I Spy Eyes by Marnie Simpson"". The ASA said knowledge of Ms Simpson's relationships with these brands wasn't a given, and said that the snaps weren't obviously identifiable as adverts. Given the length of the relationship, Diamond Whites said it did not feel the posts required hashtags but would ""look to put those in place in the future"". Unleashed PR, trading as I Spy Eyes, said Simpson did not explicitly refer to lenses or mention I Spy Eyes or the website, and therefore did not believe the snap was misleading to the consumer as the product was not available to buy. The ASA said it was the responsibility of I Spy Eyes and Diamond Whites to make sure promotional activity carried out on their behalf was compliant with the rules. It found neither snap was clearly identifiable as a marketing communication, and both breached its code, but welcomed their ""willingness to ensure they would use '#ad' in future"". The ASA ordered the posts to be deleted, rather than issuing a fine. However, as Snapchat Story posts are automatically deleted 24-hours after being posted, the former Geordie Shore star was not ordered to take any action."
2017-10-25,Jac Holmes was angry when we first met him. He hadn't been in Syria for very long but he already felt the experience had changed him. It wasn't hard to understand why.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/jac-holmes-hell-bent-on-helping-battling-the-cruelty-of-is-11096992,"He'd left his job as an IT worker and his home in Bournemouth at just 22 and been involved in some of the fiercest fighting against IS in Syria. He'd seen sex slaves and the markets that IS had set up to sell the women; he'd seen fellow fighters killed and discovered the phones left behind by the militants filled with amputations and torture. He'd come up against a resilient, violent enemy determined to die. :: British sniper who fought IS killed by landmine in Raqqa He was fired up with fury about what he saw as the Western apathy to what was happening in Syria - and the former painter and decorator was hell-bent on doing whatever he could to help those who were fighting the cruelty of IS. He was also reticent towards the media, suspicious and mindful that the foreign fighters like himself often attracted attention from journalists whilst their colleagues in the ranks of the Kurdish fighters, did not. Nevertheless, this quietly spoken young man spoke with fervour and a conviction that he was doing the right thing. He spoke angrily at what he perceived to be the British Government's inaction towards the events in Syria. This, like so many of the foreign fighters we spoke to, appeared to be what had driven them to flee their homes and lives and take up arms against the Islamic militants. ""Daesh [another name for IS] is not a problem just for Syria - or Iraq"", Jac told us, ""but for the world"". It is a sentiment echoed by many of those who've been fighting with the mainly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces. When we were there (cameraman Martin Smith, producer Nick Ludlam, medic Martin Vowles) just a few weeks ago, we were on the front line with the SDF as they took on the final IS stronghold in the National Hospital. The fighting was fierce and the demolition of Raqqa, total. Yet there were very few places as the troops moved forward trying to ensnare the final IS fighters, that had been cleared of booby-traps, mines or trigger bombs. They were everywhere. It was an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) which is believed to be what killed Mr Holmes, a hidden mine which he inadvertently triggered. The city is littered with them, now many hidden beneath piles of rubble and shattered homes and offices. The fighting may well be over in Raqqa for the time being, but the very dangerous work of making it possible for people to return is only just beginning and it won't be completed very quickly. For a start, there are just not the numbers needed to do this kind of precise and dangerous work. There isn't the machinery or equipment in the city to enable any wide scale clearance - and the troops are exhausted after months of fighting an intense and dangerous urban battle. Many of the foreign fighters we spoke to warned of the challenges which lie ahead for Raqqa and this part of Syria. ""The issue will not be driving out IS,"" Macer Gifford told us, (a former banker from Cambridge who'd joined the SDF), ""it will be what follows."" Mr Holmes' death highlights in all its horrible finality just how much there is yet to be done. He was one of the longest-serving volunteer foreign fighters in the SDF. He metamorphosed from a man ""who fixed computers"" (his own words) to a trusted member of a four-man sniper unit, who spoke fluent Kurdish and often acted as translator for many of the other foreign volunteers. He'd witnessed some of the fiercest fighting by the SDF against the extremists and had an incredible respect for the camaraderie and loyalty of the Kurdish troops who fed him, looked after him and welcomed him into their ranks. When he walked into the stadium in Raqqa along with the men and women he'd fought alongside to free the city from IS, he must have thought he'd done his job and his home was within sight. He spoke to his mother just on Sunday about his plans to be home for Christmas. His death will have shocked the very many people he knew in Syria and those who came to know him through his Facebook postings and television and newspaper interviews, coming as it did days after the fighting in Raqqa was declared over. As Jac himself said many times: ""It's the ideology of IS which needs to be tackled. You can't kill that."""
2017-10-25,A professional poker star has lost a Supreme Court challenge to get back £7.7m in winnings from a London casino.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/cheating-poker-star-phil-ivey-loses-court-battle-to-reclaim-7m-winnings-11097786,"Phil Ivey was accused of cheating by using a strategy known as edge sorting while playing a version of baccarat in Crockfords Club in 2012. The 40-year-old American - often referred to as the ""Tiger Woods of poker"" - admits using the technique but maintains it is a legitimate way of playing. However, five Supreme Court justices on Wednesday unanimously upheld the Court Of Appeal's decision and said that dishonesty was not a necessary part of ""cheating"". The court said the poker superstar had ""staged a carefully planned and executed sting"" on the Mayfair casino over two days. Edge sorting involves a player taking advantage in irregularities in the pattern on the back of a card. Patterns often vary very slightly when they reach the edge of the card; so at one edge there could be a full diamond pattern and just three-quarters of a diamond at the other edge. The gambler will manage to trick the croupier into rotating the cards so that some - for example low value cards - end up with one way and higher value cards the other way. Eagle-eyed players can tell which edge is which by sight. The player can then get a good idea of whether a low or high value card will be dealt next. During his visits to Crockfords on 21 and 22 August 2012, Mr Ivey - with another gambler Cheung Yin Sun - persuaded the croupier to rotate the most valuable cards by pretending to be superstitious. The Supreme Court court said the croupier had no idea of the significance of what she was being asked to do. ""Mr Ivey staged a carefully planned and executed sting,"" said a summary of the judgment. ""If he had secretly gained access to the shoe of cards and personally rearranged them that would be considered cheating. ""He accomplished the same results by directing the actions of the croupier and tricking her into thinking that what she did was irrelevant. Mr Ivey's actions were positive steps to fix the deck and therefore constituted cheating."" Mr Ivey is a big name in the professional poker world and has won 10 World Series of Poker bracelets and this year was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame. In a statement released after the judgment, he said it was ""contrary to the facts and any possible logic involved in our industry"". He added: ""At the time I played at Crockfords, I believed that edge-sorting was a legitimate Advantage Play technique and I believe that more passionately than ever today... ""It is very frustrating that the UK judges have no experience or understanding of casinos and Advantage Play, or the ongoing battle between casinos and professional gamblers attempting to level the playing field."""

However, the fact growth was driven by a pick-up in retail spending and car sales will intensify worries at the Bank of England that people are living beyond their means as unsecured consumer debt levels hover around pre-crisis highs at £200bn. The headline growth figure fuelled expectations the Bank will move to make borrowing less attractive and tackle rising inflation next month by raising interest rates from their post-Brexit vote low of 0.25%. Sterling - which took a pounding after the EU referendum result - sparked the inflation surge as imports became more expensive. The pound clawed back a cent against the dollar, trading above $1.32, when the ONS figures were announced as the prospect of a rate rise seemed more assured. The stats also provided some hope that manufacturers are taking advantage of the weaker pound, which makes UK goods more competitive abroad. Industrial production was up 1% in the third quarter - its best performance for over a year - though construction continued to lag with output down 0.7%. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said of the performance: ""We have a successful and resilient economy which is supporting a record number of people in employment. ""My focus now, and going into the Budget, is on boosting productivity so that we can deliver higher-wage jobs and a better standard of living for people across the country."" Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, responded: ""The UK is not growing as fast as many of our trading partners in the EU or the USA, and it is becoming increasingly clear that this government has to use next month's Budget for a change of direction."" John Hawksworth, chief economist at business services group PwC, said: ""These numbers do not change the big picture for the UK, which is of an economy that has slowed due to higher inflation linked to the weak pound and Brexit-related uncertainty dragging on business investment. ""But we should not overdo the gloom as there is nothing in this or other recent data to suggest that the slowdown is in danger of turning into a recession. ""There is also nothing in these figures that would cause the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to hold off on the quarter point interest rate rise that markets expect from their meeting next week."""

This all adds up to a problem, which is beginning to filter down to the consumer. Signs have begun to appear in supermarkets where tubs of butter once stacked up, bringing the bad news to the increasingly insatiable marketplace. One notice reads: ""Butter shortage, indefinite duration - due to a decrease in production, an increase in global demand and a disagreement on price with big distributors."" Bakers have been trying to cope with the soaring price of butter as it hits record highs of around €6 (£5.38) a kilo. Baker Samir Kichou said: ""Because the year-end holidays are approaching, with Christmas preparations and particularly the 'Galette des Rois' cake which needs a lot of butter, if there is not a significant decline, we will be forced to pass on the price rise."" Higher up the chain, Dominique Charge, president of France's federation of dairy cooperatives, explained that dairy farmers feel they receive no benefit from the price hikes. He said: ""The problem is that on the French market the right signal was not given to dairy farmers, since prices were not adjusted in relation to the drop in dairy supply."" The government has been trying to minimise the idea of a ""dairy drought"", with agriculture minister Stephane Travert urging retailers and suppliers to agree on price adjustments. The traditional croissant, both a national and international favourite, contains around 25% butter."

Those aged between 35 and 54 were most likely to admit using their phones while driving (43%), with those over 55 more likely to say they never had (54%). Using a mobile phone while driving can result in a £200 fine and six penalty points for first time offenders, a punishment that can be increased for those who continue to break the law. More than 15,000 fines have been issued since these tougher penalties came in at the beginning of March. Among those surveyed by Sky Data, almost half (43%) said the penalties were not harsh enough. Some 14% said they were too harsh and 38% said they were ""about right"". The figures come as the Department for Transport launches an ad campaign urging drivers to put their phones away while they are driving. The short film is directed by the same group behind the music video for Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy. It features a soundtrack from Aphex Twin. There are also a number of pink kittens, intended to show how much a driver can miss when they are looking at their mobile phone, and how dangerous that makes them. If a driver travelling at 30mph glances at their phone for just 2.3 seconds, they miss 100ft of road - the length of a Boeing 737, the DfT said. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said their own research had shown that the problem was ""still at epidemic proportions with a hardcore of drivers persisting in texting, talking, tweeting and even taking photos at the wheel"". He added: ""Motorists risk a collision with potentially fatal consequences which could change their life, and the lives of others, forever.

Mr Davis also told MPs he expects the outline of a transitional period, which could last around two years, to be agreed within the first three months of next year, making it ""pretty plain what we're trying to deliver"". Appearing before the House of Commons' Exiting the EU committee, Mr Davis claimed countries such as Belgium, France, Holland and Denmark would lead calls for the EU to agree the terms of Britain's future relationship in the next 18 months. EU leaders have agreed to begin internal preparatory discussions on the next phase of Brexit negotiations, on future trade and a transitional period, and could authorise the start of those talks at a European Council summit in December. Mr Davis suggested some EU member states had ""really serious investment"" in the UK, with the absence of a Brexit trade deal set to impact their economies by 3-4%. Mr Davis expressed his hope EU leaders would use their December gathering to decide their guidelines for the second phase of Brexit talks, but admitted it is ""unlikely"" they will agree the framework for a transitional period then. His words offered a clarification of the Prime Minister's apparent suggestion earlier this week that a transition deal could only be agreed once the terms of Britain's future relationship are known. On a Brexit trade deal with the EU, Mr Davis added: ""That won't be agreed in detail until 2019."" He suggested it could also be subject to mild alterations after 2019, as EU member states ratify the agreement. The Secretary of State also raised the prospect of Parliament only having a vote on the final Brexit deal after Britain formally leaves the bloc. Mr Davis claimed a Brexit trade deal and the UK's withdrawal agreement might only be agreed concurrently as late as March 2019. Mr Davis also rejected Mr Barnier's claim the UK is set for a Brexit trade deal similar to Canada's agreement with the bloc, after Theresa May chose to leave the EU's single market and customs union. He said: ""The Prime Minister has made plain we are looking for a bespoke agreement."""

Publisher Eight Mile Style sued, saying the track ripped off the rapper's acclaimed 2002 hit Lose Yourself. High Court judge Helen Cull said the campaign song sounded like a copy and was a copy. She said it was no coincidence the composer of Eminem Esque had the music to Lose Yourself in front of him when he wrote his song. She added: ""And prophetically so rapped Eminem: You better lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go."" The judge based the amount of the award on a hypothetical licence fee that the party might have paid to use the song - although Eight Mile Style rarely grants permission to use Lose Yourself in advertising. She stopped short of awarding additional damages, saying the party had only used the song after receiving professional advice that it could do so, and had not acted recklessly. The National Party said it was disappointed with the ruling. The party's president Peter Goodfellow said: ""We purchased the piece of production music from a reputable Australian-based music production library, who had purchased it from a US supplier."" He said the party was considering its next steps and already had lodged a claim against the suppliers and licence holders of the Eminem Esque track."

Eight tonnes of plastic was collected from Rio de Janeiro's bay as part of the clean-up before the 2016 Olympics and this material has been used for Ecover's washing-up liquid bottle. The company describes it as the first of its kind, also announcing it will only use 100% recycled plastic for its main washing-up liquid range next year and for all products by 2020. The bottle will be sold for £2 in Tesco stores across the country. Plastic pollution is a major problem for the world's oceans, something highlighted by Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign. More than eight million tonnes of plastic is thrown away each year and washed out to sea. It takes centuries to break down - a drink bottle can take 450 years to disintegrate, while a plastic fishing line could last for 600 years. Until then, it is eaten by marine creatures and can make its way into our food chain. More plastic was made in the first decade of the 21st century than the whole of the 20th and, by 2050, the plastic in the world's oceans will weigh more than all the fish, according to The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The UK's rivers carry plastic from across the country out into the seas around us and, from 2014 to 2015, there was a 43% increase in the number of plastic bottles washing up on UK beaches. Ecover spokesman Tom Domen said: ""We launched our first ocean bottle in 2014 to raise awareness of the impact of ocean plastic on marine life. ""It's great that the issue has shot up the agenda now but the debate for us needs to move on. ""We need to totally re-think plastic. How we make it, use it, re-use it and recycle it.

Party bosses have announced they are probing the Sheffield Hallam MP's actions after a string of his historical online comments emerged, toghether with new claims he used transphobic slurs and called a woman he dated an ""ugly b****"". Mr O'Mara, who was elected to Parliament in June's snap General Election, has already resigned from the House of Commons' Women and Equalities Committee amid the row. The 35-year-old has described himself as ""deeply ashamed"" of his online comments and claims he has been on a ""journey of education"" since making them. He strenously denies other claims he verbally abused a woman he met on a dating app earlier this year, branding the allegations ""categorically untrue"". Ms Nandy called for Labour to follow the party's ""clear rules"" for dealing with claims of discrimination. Speaking at an event on Tuesday night, the Wigan MP said: ""Suspension is not a presumption of guilt or trying to stop any ability for individuals to express remorse or move forwards. ""But we have a very clear process in the Labour Party that in my view ought to be upheld. ""In this case, just as in previous cases, it's absolutely clear: we suspend and we investigate and we make a decision."" Manchester Central MP Ms Powell also called for Mr O'Mara to be suspended as she questioned how he could have passed Labour's internal vetting procedures for parliamentary candidates. From Jared regarding today. pic.twitter.com/LSnwzr9MeX She told ITV: ""One of the key questions you're asked when you become a candidate for the Labour party - and you have to sign a contract to say this - is there anything in your past that would bring the party into disrepute? ""And I don't understand, in all honesty, how Jared could have signed that paper."" On Tuesday, Sophie Evans claimed Mr O'Mara made offensive comments to her in March - just months before he was elected. Describing how she met the politician before going on a date with him, but then decided it wasn't to be, Ms Evans told Sky News: ""We were outside a club in Sheffield. ""He looked me up and down and said a lot of stuff that isn't repeatable but then called me an ugly b****. ""I was really annoyed when people were trying to defend him. ""Colleagues in the Labour Party saying it was a long time ago that he made the misogynistic and sexist comments. ""Well, the insults against me were this year - just months before he stood as an MP. I don't have any political affiliation but I don't think he is fit to be an MP."" She has also claimed Mr O'Mara had used ""transphobic slurs"". On Monday, Mr O'Mara was applauded by Mr Corbyn and other MPs for offering a ""mea culpa"" for comments made on an online forum between 2002 and 2004. Among them were posts calling gay people ""f****-packers"" and suggesting singer Jamie Cullum should be raped to death with his own piano. A senior Labour source told Sky News of Mr O'Mara's apology at a meeting of MPs: ""He talked about his own experience as a young man, his own journey and his history as a disabled person. ""The room was silent while he was speaking. You could hear a pin drop."" Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner told Sky News the apology was ""heartfelt""."

Her defection will be seen as a bitter blow to Mr Rowe, who took over as M&S's chief executive last year. He recruited Jill McDonald, who ran the bicycles retailer Halfords‎, as managing director for clothing, home and beauty in May, but her lack of fashion retailing experience has been questioned by City analysts. Ms Jenkins was seen as a crucial part of M&S's clothing executive team, but is said to have been disappointed to have been passed over for the role that was handed to Ms McDonald. A source close to M&S said that Ms Jenkins' departure was expected to be announced shortly and was likely to be brought forward as a result of the leak to Sky News. Mr Rowe faces a crucial test of his credentials during the next three months, with Archie Norman, the retail veteran who has just taken over as M&S's chairman, understood to be closely scrutinising every area of the company's operations. While M&S's food operations have continued to perform well - despite a slowdown disclosed in July - ‎Mr Rowe needs to demonstrate that he can inject sustained growth back into its clothing operations. Last year, he announced a plan to shut some underperforming stores and reallocate space in others. An M&S spokesperson said: ""We're delighted for Jo - she's been a real talent here at M&S, which is reflected in the progress she has made both professionally and for the business. ""Becoming CEO at a company like White Stuff is a natural next step for her. We wish her all the very best with her new role."""
2017-10-25,Police hunting fugitive conman Mark Acklom have been told of two potential sightings of him.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/sightings-reported-of-fugitive-british-conman-mark-acklom-11096757,"They said they had received ""potentially significant information"" after appealing for the public's help in a Sky News interview. Detectives had believed Acklom was hiding in Spain with his Spanish wife and children, but could be anywhere in Europe. They would not confirm where the sightings were reported. Their appeal had focused on Acklom's wife and the couple's two young daughters, aged eight and six, who they believe are likely enrolled in a private, international school. They have urged parents at such schools to try to identify the family who may appear to be Spanish. Avon and Somerset Police, who want Acklom for allegedly fleecing a woman of her £850,000 life savings, said in a statement: ""Information has been provided relating to two potential sightings in Europe which we are now actively following up with the help of our partner law enforcement agencies. ""The appeal is still active and we're still extremely keen for sightings or information about Acklom's whereabouts to be reported."" Detectives are worried about the welfare of the two girls, who were suddenly taken out of their school near Murcia a year ago when we revealed that Acklom, 44, was about to be added to the Crimestoppers and National Crime Agency Most Wanted lists. Detective Inspector Adam Bunting said: ""They've been uprooted away from their family, away from their friends, away from their school overnight. They didn't have a chance to say goodbye to their friends. ""As they are living on the run with their father who is a wanted fugitive, we have some concerns for their wellbeing."" Acklom's wife is Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez, 47, who may be running a property business. She could also be working as a yoga teacher, or attending yoga classes. Police believe she is helping her husband stay free, but has not committed any offence. Acklom is the subject of a European Arrest Warrant, but his wife is not. Acklom is known to use the name Marc Ros Rodriguez and other aliases and has connections in Spain in Murcia, Cartagena, Alicante and Madrid. He also has links to Italy and Ireland. In May, he was photographed at a cafe in Geneva, Switzerland, having coffee with a fellow fugitive, wanted Spanish fraudster Jose Manuel Costas Estevez. Acklom is wanted in the UK for an alleged fraud against Carolyn Woods, 58, who was running a boutique in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, when they met. She said he claimed to be a wealthy Swiss banker and MI6 agent, before duping her into lending him her £850,000 life savings and then vanishing. Anyone in the UK with information is urged to call, anonymously, the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111, or from Spain dial 900 555 111.

2017-10-25,Harvey Weinstein has been banned by the Academy and the BFI and suspended from BAFTA - based only on accusations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/does-weinstein-scandal-mask-institutional-problem-11087955,"It is an odd thing, the institutional mentality. At times it is random, imprecise, unfair; what applies to one person seldom applies to all, and there seems to be a blatant indifference to the rule of law. Harvey Weinstein has been accused by more than 40 women of either sexual harassment, sexual assault or even rape - but he has denied the allegations against him and has yet to be charged with any offence. However, the Academy, it seems, felt pressured to react to the dozens of stars who were ""shocked and disgusted"" by his alleged behaviour, and on Sunday announced it was banning the film mogul. The group, which has more than 8,000 members, said the film producer ""does not merit the respect of his colleagues"". :: Hollywood's PR machine and its secret scandal BAFTA was even swifter, making the announcement just five days after the New York Times published its first expose. ""While BAFTA has previously been a beneficiary of Mr Weinstein's support for its charitable work, it considers the reported alleged behaviour completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA's values,"" the organisation said. Without going into the details of legal procedures, where everyone is innocent until proven guilty - yawn, right? - how do the good folks at the British Academy Of Film and Television Arts feel about running a retrospective on Roman Polanski? :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's infamous casting couch In 1978, the French-Polish director admitted the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. Twenty-five years later, he won both best director and best film for The Pianist at the BAFTA awards. He also won best director at the Oscars. Whatever problems these institutions have with the Weinstein claims, they didn't have with Polanski. The British Film Institute was not as quick to condemn Weinstein, but has now withdrawn the fellowship awarded to him in 2002. ""Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" the BFI said in a statement. ""Everyone working in the film industry - in any industry - should be safe and respected in the workplace."" By acting like this, of both judge and jury of accused filmmakers, actors or producers, film institutions risk being dragged into the spotlight by the industry and the media. The most sensible thing to do would be to write up a code of conduct for members to protect actors from casting couch-type situations. The BFI has now promised to do so, incorporating it in its diversity standards. They should wait for court proceedings, if any, to be over to make any sort of decision regarding members - or risk fuelling a lynch mob-like mentality, with subjects trialled by their peers and social media before they are even charged with an offence. Granted, Weinstein could end up facing a jury one day, and I'm certainly not defending him - but we shouldn't be treating him as a criminal either. Not yet, anyway."

The electrician had been accused of putting his hand on a man's hip to avoid spilling a drink in a crowded bar. After arriving at Glasgow Airport late on Tuesday, he said he felt ""very good"" and that he was ""very happy to be home"". Mr Harron, from Stirling, was asked what he would do first when he got home. He replied: ""Get in a good bed, it's been a total shambles. ""It's just total shock I feel. ""I get to sleep in my own bed because I've been sleeping on my mate's couch for three and half months. ""I can't believe it's been four months in total."" He would not rule out returning to the United Arab Emirates, despite his experience, saying: ""I'm not going back in a hurry, but I would go back later on. ""I think I've been caught up in a bad situation. ""I didn't see light at the end of the tunnel to be honest."" Mr Harron, who had been working in Afghanistan, had been on a two-day visit to the popular tourist destination when the incident took place at Dubai's Rock Bottom Bar in the summer. Following his arrest, he lost his job and was told he could spend years in prison. Mr Harron was also sentenced, in his absence, to 30 days in prison for failing to appear in court, for allegedly making a rude gesture and for drinking alcohol during the same incident. He was jailed for five days before being released on bail with his passport taken away. But he was freed after the emirate's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum made a special order for cases against him to be dismissed. The intervention was described by Radha Stirling, chief executive of campaign group Detained in Dubai, as ""a courageous and honourable decision"". She had added: ""While it highlights the urgent need for judicial reform in the country, it is also a hopeful sign that the United Arab Emirates' leadership possesses the will and vision to pursue such reforms in the future."" Police had called Mr Harron on Monday telling him that the charges against him had been dropped and he could collect his passport."

It credited a ""strong financial performance"" with net interest income - the amount of money it makes through interest charges - rising 12%. The bank also cited a lack of any new provisions to cover the cost of past mistakes. Lloyds did not add to its industry-leading bill to account for the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal, having taken a £1bn hit in its third quarter last year. It has cost the bank more than £18bn to date and said it was still receiving more claims than had been anticipated - around 11,000 per week - which it partly attributed to an advertising campaign on a deadline for claims by the City regulator featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Lloyds chief executive, Antonio Horta-Osorio, said: ""In the first nine months of the year we have delivered strong financial performance with increased underlying and statutory profit, a significant improvement in returns and strong capital generation. ""These results highlight the strength of our customer focused, simple and low risk business model and the benefits of our competitive advantage in the UK."" He said the UK economy remained ""resilient"" despite pressure on the banking sector to hold more cash in reserve and be more careful on lending. Regulators fear the industry is over exposed to levels of unsecured borrowing not seen since the financial crisis - topping £200bn - with many consumers out of their depth. Lloyds said its credit card book, which includes MBNA, had seen a drop in persistent levels of debt. It added that higher income across the business would now mitigate regulatory demands for higher capital requirements but it maintained its long term guidance on revenue and profits. The bank's return to private hands following its 2008 bailout has not concluded its financial crisis-linked troubles. Lloyds is currently fighting a claim by almost 6,000 former shareholders that they were misled over the takeover ofHalifax Bank of Scotland. Its shares were trading 1.5% lower in early FTSE 100 trading on Wednesday. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""Lloyds has been making solid progress but it now faces some headwinds. ""After a strong stretch of profit growth it was definitely the star of the UK banking show, but as we have been flagging there are mounting risks from its growing exposure to unsecured lending at a time when the economy looks more likely to hit the skids than deliver a marked improvement."""

2017-10-25,"A toddler allegedly killed by her adoptive father may have had rickets, making fractures more likely, a court has heard. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/elsie-scully-hicks-toddler-may-have-had-rickets-court-hears-11096505,"Elsie Scully-Hicks was 18 months old when she was taken to the University Hospital of Wales on 25 May 2016 with multiple fractures, after collapsing and having a cardiac arrest. She died four days later. Her adoptive father, Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, denies murder. Doctors found Elsie had three separate areas of subdural bleeding, retinal bleeding in both eyes, a skull fracture and fractures to three ribs and her leg. Cardiff Crown Court heard she could have been suffering from a vitamin D deficiency, and could even have had rickets, which might have been the cause of her fractures. Professor Michael Holick, an American endocrinologist, gave evidence on Tuesday, via video-link from Boston. Elsie's vitamin D level was 31 nanomoles per litre before she died, which the professor said would have given her an increased risk of rickets, leading to a higher likelihood of fractures. He told the court: ""In my opinion, with a high degree of medical certainty, if I was to see her (Elsie) with that blood level there is no question that she was vitamin D deficient and extremely high risk of rickets."" He also assessed X-rays of Elsie's legs after a leg injury she suffered in November 2015. After her death, two fractures were found in the images, a lower leg fracture and one above her knee. Prof Holick said those fractures were ""classic radiologic signs for vitamin D deficiency"". But in a previous hearing, a bone and joint specialist, Professor Anthony Freemont, said there was no evidence to point towards vitamin D deficiency or rickets. Paul Lewis QC, for the prosecution, told the court on Tuesday that levels set by the British Paediatric and Adolescent Bone Group meant Elsie had insufficient levels of vitamin D - but not a deficiency The defence's assertion is based on US standards that classify deficiency as below 50 nanomoles. Mr Lewis asked Prof Holick: ""I am asking you about this little girl. Did she have rickets?"" He replied: ""There is radiologic evidence for rickets."" Mr Lewis asked what rickets had to do with retinal haemorrhaging or subdural bleeding, to which the professor responded ""nothing"". Mr Lewis said: ""The vitamin D deficiency has got nothing to do with the things that caused (Elsie's) death, does it, Professor?"" Prof Holick said it did not. A paediatrician previously told the court that it was likely Elsie was ""shaken violently"" before she died. She also suffered bruises to her head in December and January 2016, and in March was taken to hospital after allegedly falling down the stairs. In a police interview, Scully-Hicks called Elsie ""a happy little girl"" and his husband, Craig Scully-Hicks, told the court their home had been ""filled with love and happiness all the time"". The trial continues."
2017-10-25,"From admissions of unwanted advances towards children to jail time for abusing them, Hollywood is haunted by tales of paedophilia.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/hollywood-sex-abuse-are-the-kids-alright-11086776,"The Weinstein scandal opened the floodgates to what is rapidly becoming an industry-wide revolt against the so-called casting couch culture in Hollywood, where film moguls use their power to take advantage of aspiring actors. Dozens of women have shared their alleged stories of Harvey Weinstein, ranging from sexual harassment to rape, while hundreds have taken the opportunity to join the #MeToo movement - a social network insurgency against the ""dirty men"" of the media industry. But while all this happens in plain sight, helped by its strength in numbers and the endorsement of several A-list celebrities, another issue seems to have been swept under the red carpet. For years, former child stars including Elijah Wood and Alison Arngrim have tried to denounce what they call Hollywood's systemic paedophilia problem. ""I'm saying that the people who did this to me are still working, are still out there and are some of the richest and most powerful people in Hollywood,"" former teen idol Corey Feldman told ABC in 2014, four years after his best friend and co-star Corey Haim died of a drug overdose. :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's infamous casting couch ""With me, there were some molestations, and it did come from several hands, so to speak,"" Feldman told the Hollywood Reporter last year, in yet another attempt to bring the issue to light. ""But with Corey [Haim], it was direct rape. And his occurred when he was 11."" The two Coreys starred together in The Lost Boys five years after the alleged rape took place, and in another seven films after that. Feldman has never named his or Haim's abusers, but used the Weinstein momentum to announce he is ""working on a plan to shed light on the situation and get actual justice"". Feldman and Haim have for years been the go-to example of child abuse rumours in Hollywood, but the accusations didn't begin in the 1980s - nor did they end with them. Sky News spoke to Jeff Herman, a lawyer who represented a number of former child actors who have previously accused high-profile directors and Hollywood executives of abuse. ""Kids have been exploited for decades in Hollywood but had no voice frankly,"" Mr Herman said. ""You've got an industry where kids are working, which doesn't really happen anywhere else,"" he added. ""You have kids who want to be movie stars looking for their breaks, their parents who are pushing them into these professions - and they're all at the mercy of these producers and of these directors."" ""So what happens is there's an imbalance of power, these kids become particularly vulnerable to being exploited."" Mr Herman was involved in the case of Michael Egan against X-Men director Bryan Singer, where the former teen model accused the director and other executives of sex abuse. The defendants in those cases denied liability and the claims were subsequently dropped. ""I can't talk about Singer,"" Mr Herman told Sky. ""But I can talk about other types of claims, victims that have come forward to me and talked about what's happening in Hollywood."" Mr Herman says that there is a ""conspiracy of abuse"" in the industry where powerful men think ""underage kids are available to them as a perk of Hollywood"". Allison Arngrim, the child actress who played young Nellie Dalton in Little House On The Prairie, wrote in her autobiography about her experiences as a victim of child abuse in the 1970s. ""In Hollywood, there are parents who will practically prostitute their kids in the hope they can make money and get ahead. It is a horrible trap that the kids are in,"" Arngrim wrote. ""These people aren't seeing their kid as a kid. It's more common than you think."" Organisations like the Screen Actors Guild and the Association of Talent Agents helped pass a bill in 2012 which makes it illegal for sex offenders to work with children in the industry. Mr Herman believes this is not enough. ""In most of these cases, victims are compliant,"" he told us. :: Sky Views: Hollywood's sanctimony awards season ""Which means they might be physically participating even though they can't consent - so they don't come forward and talk about it."" ""If no one is convicted of a crime you can do all the checks you want and nothing is going to show up on a record."" The bill was passed by the Governor of California 11 years after a convicted child molester was welcomed back to Hollywood. Victor Salva was found guilty of molesting 12-year-old Nathan Forrest Winters in 1988 while shooting the film Clownhouse. Less than a decade after his conviction, Salva was directing a Disney film called Powder and, in 2001, he got Francis Ford Coppola to produce his horror flick Jeepers Creepers, a film which stars two young actors. He even shot a sequel to Creepers, and just last year was casting for a third instalment, looking for a young actress to play a 13-year-old who escapes her abusive grandfather. Hollywood forgets and Hollywood forgives. In 2015, documentary-maker Amy Berg released An Open Secret, an investigative film looking into historical child sex abuse in Hollywood. In the film, Berg shines a light on an ""iceberg of child abuse"" which includes talent managers, directors, producers and actors. Among them is Marty Weiss, a talent manager who pleaded guilty to two accounts of child abuse; Bob Villard, who once represented Leonardo DiCaprio and who also pleaded guilty to child abuse; and Brian Peck, an actor who starred in the X-Men films and has served more than a year in prison for abusing a child star. Berg faced the wrath of the Screen Actors Guild, who threatened to sue her if she didn't retract every mention of the organisation. She didn't. The reason behind the threat of litigation was Michael Harrah, a manager of child actors and long-time member of the guild. In Berg's documentary, she asks Harrah if he is ""attracted to young boys"", to which he responds ""not particularly, no"". But later in the documentary, Harrah is heard apparently admitting to have touched a child actor. ""Yeah, and that was something unwanted I shouldn't have done,"" he says. He later denied all the claims and said the conversation was taken out of context. After Weinstein, women in Hollywood have joined hands in what seems like a turning point in Hollywood's sex culture and gender dynamics. But a smaller movement is emerging from the industry's dark underbelly. Last week, Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard parted ways with his agent Tyler Grasham after a former actor accused Grasham of sexual assault. The agent was later fired by the firm and has since deleted his social media accounts and refused to comment. In a post-Weinstein interview with The Guardian, director Paul Haggis questioned if there was a group of people in the industry ""covering for paedophiles"". Feldman is staging a comeback. Slowly but steadily, voices once ignored are being heard, and this could lead to studios having a tighter grip on what happens on and off set. ""It's shocking for me to hear that there's more than one perpetrator in the same place where there are kids,"" Mr Herman said. ""Obviously everyone knows what's going on. I hope this is a watershed moment for Hollywood."""

He lamented what he called the ""flagrant disregard of truth and decency"" in politics, saying: ""Heaven help us."" The Arizona senator announced he would not run for re-election next year. Mr Flake was one of two Republican senators who launched fierce attacks against the President, with Bob Corker, who has also said previously he is not running for re-election, earlier calling Mr Trump a liar who has damaged the country's standing in the world. The White House responded by saying it was ""probably a good move"" that Mr Flake was not running for re-election. Mr Flake said his decision to leave America's upper chamber was motivated by his being out of step with his party. ""There may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party,"" he said. But he went on to say that there were times when one must put principles and one's career ahead of party politics and he could no longer remain silent. He said the efficacy of the US leadership around the globe was coming into question as the country gave up on its principles in favour of anger and resentment. The ""instinct to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a backward-looking people"", he said. Earlier, as Mr Trump attended a Republican party policy lunch in Capitol Hill, a protester threw Russian flags at the President. Mr Corker got into his spat with Mr Trump over the President's proposed tax cut. The Republican senator for Tennessee said the White House should leave it to Congress to work out how to slice $1trn (£761bn) from the government's income. It came as a Reuters/IPSOS poll found that 63% of Americans said reducing the deficit should take priority over corporate tax cuts. The President has previously upset other senior members of his own party, including former Presidential candidate John McCain, who said the President's attacking of the media was ""how dictators start"" and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, whom he attacked for failing to force through a replacement for Obamacare. Both thanked Mr Flake after his remarks and said they looked forward to working with him for the remaining 18 months before his term was up, with Mr McCain describing him as a man of ""integrity, honour and decency"". Former president George W Bush also launched a thinly veiled but hard-hitting attack on Mr Trump's administration last week."

In a study for motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, Dr Adam Snow, a criminology lecturer at Liverpool Hope University, found that each year British drivers are given: :: Eight million local authority parking penalties :: 2.5 million local authority bus lane and box junction penalties :: Half a million late licensing and insurance penalties :: One million speeding and red-light penalties Dr Snow said cuts to police budgets had been ""perhaps the main driver"" of the reliance on cameras to catch drivers out. However, his report also warned that increasing use of cameras to do this could lead to the fear among drivers that there is no use of discretion or common sense. RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said: ""To maintain its legitimacy, automatic enforcement must be viewed by the public as proportionate. ""While wrongdoing should be punished and not excused, a decline in front-line policing risks an imbalanced approach to enforcement. ""Millions of motorists are being caught by camera, often for arguably minor misdemeanours, whilst more serious and harmful behaviour goes undetected."" Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said: ""Income raised through on-street parking charges and fines is spent on running parking services and any surplus is only spent on essential transport projects, such as tackling the £12bn roads repair backlog and creating new parking spaces."""
2017-10-25,"Government attempts to avoid responsibility for the contaminated blood scandal that caused the deaths of more than 2,400 people from AIDS and Hepatitis C can be revealed for the first time by Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171025130928/http://news.sky.com/story/contaminated-blood-cover-up-revealed-in-cabinet-papers-11097117,"Previously unseen cabinet documents show senior ministers in the 1987 Conservative Government pursued a deliberate policy of not accepting any responsibility for allowing contaminated blood products to be given to haemophiliacs. The papers also show ministers tried to limit the Government's financial liability to victims - despite privately acknowledging it could not ""refute convincingly"" the allegation that it was at fault. In the 1970s and 1980s more than 4,000 British haemophiliacs were given blood products contaminated with HIV and Hepatitis C. Because the UK was not self-sufficient in blood products the substance - called Factor VIII - was imported from the United States, where it had been manufactured with blood drawn from multiple donors. These included prisoners, habitual drug users and sex workers who had been paid for their blood. Campaigners say the cabinet papers amount to evidence of a cover-up. Former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham, now metro mayor for Manchester, told Sky News the documents show ""attempts to deny victims support, truth and justice went to the very top of Government."" Lord Owen, who as health secretary in the 1970's proposed Britain should be self-sufficient in blood products, a policy which if followed may have avoided thousands of deaths, said the papers revealed the Government had ""clear responsibility and liability"". The new details are contained in a cabinet memo from 1987, written by the then Conservative Secretary of State for Social Security John Moore. The document was unearthed by campaigner Jason Evans, whose father Jonathan was infected with both HIV and Hepatitis C and died in 1993, when his son was four. The memo is a note of a proposal put to the Cabinet Home and Social Affairs Committee sub-committee on AIDS, a body that included some of the most high-profile ministers of the Margaret Thatcher Government including Willie Whitelaw, Norman Fowler, Douglas Hurd, Kenneth Clarke and future Prime Minister John Major. The meeting was convened to discuss the fall-out from the unfolding contaminated blood scandal on November 4, 1987, a day before the Haemophilia society was due to lobby MPs in Parliament. By 1987 it was clear that thousands of people had been infected and were dying, and in the memo Mr Moore acknowledged the scale of the problem. ""About 1,200 haemophiliacs were infected before 1986 with the HIV virus by Factor VIII and about 40 have already died of AIDS. The prognosis for the remainder is bleak,"" he wrote. Mr Moore, who was in talks with the Haemophilia Society about a possible financial settlement, acknowledged that the Government's denial of responsibility was unlikely to be believed. ""The (Haemophilia) Society have successfully got across their view that the haemophiliac's problems with AIDS is due to Government's failure to ensure self-sufficiency in blood products. While unfair, this is hard to refute convincingly in presentational terms,"" he stated. Mr Moore went on to discuss ways of limiting the financial assistance paid to victims while pursuing a policy of not accepting responsibility. Discussing a proposed £10m ""once-and-for-all payment"" to be administered by the Haemophilia Society, he wrote: ""(This) is particularly attractive as it minimises Government intervention; and it would be consistent with the policy of not accepting any direct responsibility for damage caused in this way."" The minister also revealed concern about the impact of any payments on potential future litigation. He wrote: ""Lawyers advise that payments received by haemophiliacs in this way might not be as helpful legally as would a direct ex-gratia payment by the Government should a haemophiliac take legal action; which at this stage seems unlikely."" The payment scheme ultimately went ahead and, in the 1990s, the Government made ex-gratia payments of £60,000 to those infected with HIV, who were forced to waive any right to legal action. The revelations come with campaigners still awaiting details of how the Government intends to proceed with an inquiry into the scandal promised by Theresa May. Three months after the Prime Minister made the pledge, a chairman has still not been appointed and the format, terms of reference and timing are yet to be confirmed. In addition, around 500 victims and their relatives have launched a High Court action against the Department of Health. Mr Evans, who is the lead complainant in the legal action, says the memo is evidence of a cover-up. ""For 20 years people have been told that we had no case, that the Government had no responsibility, and that the deaths were not the result of the failure to ensure self-sufficiency in blood products,"" he told Sky News. ""But what this shows is that from the very start the Government knew their argument was weak. It was 'hard to refute' because it was true. ""This is some of the clearest evidence we have ever had that points towards a cover-up. Here it is in black and white that we have been told for 20 years one thing, but actually the Secretary of State in 1987 was saying quite the opposite - and it has never been made public until now. If that is not a cover-up then what is?"" Lord Owen, who previously revealed that records from his time as health secretary had been destroyed, said: ""I think (government) has responsibility, and personally I think there is a strong case they have liability. ""They admit that in this cabinet paper when they say it would be very hard to refute, and it has already been proven hard to refute. ""I think now the Government has decided to do something about it cuts through all this legal argument and comes up with a generous settlement."" Mr Burnham said: ""These revelations tell us that at the very top of Government, from the Cabinet downwards, there was an attempt to deny support to the victims and to deny them truth and justice. ""That's what people have suspected for many years and now these revelations begin to give the full picture and it really is a very dark chapter in our country's history."" The Department of Health said it could not comment on the actions of former governments or ministers but a spokesman said: ""The infected blood scandal of the 1970s and 80s is an appalling tragedy which should simply never have happened, which is why this Government committed to a full inquiry to ensure that victims and their families finally get the answers they have spent decades waiting for. ""Views put forward in the consultation will now be considered and the nature of the inquiry will be announced in due course."" Mr Moore was made a life peer in 1992. His office at the House of Lord's did not respond to a request for comment."
2017-10-26,The UK's population is set to grow by 4.4 million in the next 12 years - passing the 70 million mark.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171026140106/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-population-set-to-pass-70-million-mark-by-2029-11099311,"Official figures project the number of inhabitants will reach 69.2 million during the next decade, a rise of 3.6 million, or 5.5%, from 65.6 million last year. The Office for National Statistics said the population growth would continue to pass 70 million by mid-2029, reaching 72.9 million in 2041. Migration - directly and indirectly - will account for more than three-quarters (77%) of population growth during the next 25 years. The rest of the rise is accounted for by the gap between births and deaths. Migrants who go on to have children will affect numbers, as will the people emigrating before they have children. The study also predicts the number of people aged 85 or over will double from 1.6 million to 3.2 million. England is projected to grow more quickly than the other UK nations (5.9%), followed by Northern Ireland (4.2%), Scotland (3.2%) and Wales (3.1%). Statisticians said the total projected increase across the UK is lower than that during the previous quarter of a century. Between mid-1991 and mid-2016 the population grew by 8.2 million (14.3%). It is forecast to swell by 7.3 million (11.2%) between now and mid-2041 - around the equivalent of the current populations of Scotland and Northern Ireland combined. Figures predict the UK's population will have increased by 16% between 2015 and 2040, according to estimates. This compares to 10% for France and 4% for Germany during the same period, while Italy's population is projected to see a slight decline. ONS statistician Andrew Nash said: ""These projections suggest slower growth than the previous (2014-based) projections... because of lower assumptions about future levels of fertility and international migration, and an assumption of a slower rate of increase in life expectancy."" The forecasts do not attempt to predict the impact of the UK leaving the European Union."
2017-10-26,New security measures brought in by the Trump administration will mean all US-bound air travellers are likely to have to provide further details at the airport before they fly.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171026140106/http://news.sky.com/story/passengers-on-all-us-bound-flights-face-new-screenings-11098302,"A US government spokeswoman said the new security screening measures will apply to all flights into America from abroad. Lisa Farbstein, spokeswoman for the US Transportation Security Administration, said the controls would apply to approximately 2,100 flights arriving daily to America. The measures are expected to be effective immediately. The British Department for Transport said it does not expect the new procedures to have a significant impact on UK passengers or airport operations. ""We work closely with all our international partners to keep aviation security under constant review, but for obvious reasons we do not comment on specifics,"" a spokesman said. BA flights would continue to operate as normal, a spokeswoman said, adding: ""The safety and security of our customers is always our top priority."" Lufthansa, Emirates, Air France, Norwegian Air, Cathay Pacific and EgyptAir were among those who said they would implement tougher controls at departure desks. Other airlines have yet to respond. It is not clear exactly what all the extra checks will consist of. Some airlines said ""interviews"" would be carried out and Air France said the checks would take the form of a questionnaire. But all passengers were told to arrive earlier than they would have done to make sure they make their flight. The warnings about the extra checks came as the US government enforced new controls on the movement of refugees and immigrants as well as the transport of technology. Ms Farbstein said the new security measures ""may include"" enhanced passenger screening, heightened screening of electronics and increased security measures. It would also include stricter security procedures around planes and in airport terminals, she said, and both US citizens and foreigners would face the same new controls. The measures are expected to be effective immediately. Royal Jordanian said the new procedures would start on its flights in mid-January after US authorities granted the airline's request for a delay. Emirates said it was starting ""pre-screening interviews"" at its check-in desks and boarding gates in Dubai, adding: ""These measures will work in complement with the current additional screening measures conducted at the boarding gate."" Cathay Pacific said passengers heading to the US ""will be subject to a short security interview"" at check-in or the gates. EgyptAir said the new measures included more detailed searches of passengers and their luggage and interviews. Lufthansa Group, which includes Austrian Airlines, Swiss, Eurowings and several other airlines, said: ""In addition to the controls of electronic devices already introduced, travellers to the USA might now also face short interviews at check-in, document check or (their) gate."" The extra restrictions come just a few months after Donald Trump's travel ban on visitors from specific countries was expanded to include people from North Korea, Venezuela and Chad."
2017-10-26,Uber is lining up a banking veteran to chair its British operations in an effort to establish a more robust governance framework that could help prevent the loss of its London operating licence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171026140106/http://news.sky.com/story/uber-lines-up-banker-to-chair-uk-unit-amid-london-ban-appeal-11099160,"Sky News has learnt that the world's most valuable ride-hailing app has identified Laurel Powers-Freeling, a former chief executive of Marks & Spencer Money, as the leading candidate for the new position. An announcement about Ms Powers-Freeling's appointment is said to be likely within the next few days, although sources cautioned that a deal had yet to be signed. Insiders suggested that if finalised, her appointment would add a heavyweight presence to Uber's UK operations. Ms Powers-Freeling is a former director of and senior adviser to the Bank of England; and currently serves on boards including Atom Bank, the digital lender, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe, and C Hoare and Co, the private bank. She has previously worked for companies such as American Express, Lloyds TSB and Prudential. Uber's search for an independent business figure to chair its UK business has acquired greater urgency in recent weeks, following the ban announced by Transport for London (TfL) last month. Regulators said that Uber was no longer ""a fit and proper"" holder of a private-hire licence , and Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, accused the company of ""failing to play by the rules"", Plans for the appointment of a UK chair, which is being overseen by headhunting firm The Inzito Partnership, were drawn up prior to the ban being announced. Since then, Uber has hired an army of advisers, including a regulatory consultancy set up by the former boss of Ofcom, to aid its appeal against the loss of one of its most lucrative licences globally. The ride-hailing app's work with Flint Global forms part of its efforts to convince regulators that it is a responsible operator, despite opposition from licensed taxi drivers' representatives and a number of other powerful lobbying groups. Uber's new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, travelled to London earlier this month for talks with TfL, with both sides describing their discussion as ""constructive"". The first hearing in the appeal process, which is likely to stretch well into 2018, is scheduled to be held in December. The ban on Uber has sparked a furious backlash from many Londoners, with more than 700,000 people signing a petition to allow the company to keep operating despite its failure to report a string of criminal offences perpetrated by its drivers. Uber now has about 40,000 drivers in London‎, and is used by about 3.5 million customers, but its rise has sparked the most significant backlash to date against a major champion of the ""gig economy"". Losing its ability to operate in London could threaten its ability to preserve its licences in other cities around the world, where it has also come under intense regulatory pressure. In turn, that would affect Uber's chances of attaining a premium valuation in a stock market flotation that Mr Khosrowshahi has indicated is likely within 18 months. Since TfL's decision to ban the company, a number of senior executives including Jo Bertram, Uber's northern Europe chief, and European head of policy Christopher Burghardt have resigned."

The watchdog said BT had agreed to its suggestion that almost one million households who buy only a landline telephone service should see their monthly bills slashed by £7 per month, through a line rental cut. This represents a saving of £84 a year, it added. BT said it would introduce the reduction from April next year. Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition group director, said: ""For many people, their landline is their lifeline. ""But households who only have a landline - and no broadband - have seen their phone bills soar. ""Many are elderly, and have been with BT for decades. We've been clear that they must get a better deal. So I'm pleased BT has responded to our plans in full by cutting these customers' bills."" The company responded: ""We welcome a balanced voluntary agreement with Ofcom which means that up to one million of our customers who don't have broadband will receive a substantial cut in the price of their line rental from April 2018. ""We have listened to the concerns of our line-only customers and agreed to reduce the price of line rental for them by £7 a month, or £84 a year, which means they will only pay £11.99 a month for standard line rental. ""This will come in to effect from April 2018 for all landline-only customers who just take phone services from us and don't have broadband (either with BT or someone else). ""We already offer low income customers on certain benefits a special tariff called 'BT Basic' and also offer Home Phone Saver that provides a great value bundle for customers who want a traditional phone service, with Anytime calls and other benefits."""

Her husband Ummar Mirza and his sister Zainub Mirza had already pleaded guilty to similar offences. The trial heard how Taheer and her partner Mirza had boasted to each other about their extremist views and discussed how they would celebrate their marriage by carrying out an attack. In one exchange between the couple, Ummar Mirza wrote: ""The day of nikkah [wedding], I'll kill em all. Give me the list, the only thing that stops me is we are not married. I will defo, I'm not joking."" Taheer responded: ""Lool, u can't have it til u put a ring on it."" They purchased a rubber dummy, often used in martial arts, and a rubber training knife which they used to rehearse for a terror attack at their home in Alum Rock, Birmingham. Taheer then bought a £120 hunting knife online along with a device to allow it to be concealed under clothing. In an earlier Whatsapp chat they had discussed who they would like to behead. Mirza identified the leader of the far right group Britain First. He wrote: ""I want Paul Golding's head."" Taheer replied: ""I fantasise about Katie Hopkins head. She's the biggest kuthi [bitch] of them all."" Matt Ward, head of counter terrorism at West Midlands Police, told Sky News their extremist views can be traced back at least two years. ""It certainly seems that this year they had accelerated their extremism,"" he said. ""This wasn't jokey, they were sharing some really violent disturbing extremist material that encouraged the support and gave instructions of how to carry out bladed weapons attacks on innocent members of the public."" The trio were arrested before they could implement their plot after careful collaboration between the police and the security services. DCS Ward explained: ""I'm not going to confirm or deny any of the targets but there was a clear intention to plan for and carry out a terrorist attack I think that was probably going to take place within the West Midlands, within Birmingham. ""Had we, policing and the security services, not acted when we did then there would have been a further atrocity carried out in addition to the ones we have already seen carried out this year in London and Manchester."""

The alleged offence is said to have occurred before the shootings by Stephen Paddock on 1 October at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in the Nevada city. The allegations are understood to involve ""one count of possession of child or youth pornography"" and ""19 counts of sexual exploitation of a child"". The complaint alleges Bruce Douglas Paddock possessed more than 600 images of child abuse between 1 January and 30 August 2014. The suspect was expected to be formally charged on Thursday. He is not considered to have been involved in the Las Vegas shooting, but police said they spoke to Stephen Paddock's entire ""family tree"" following the massacre. Another brother, Eric Paddock, spoke to media in the aftermath of the shooting but Bruce Paddock did not. Bruce Paddock reportedly had a long criminal history and over the years has been charged with various crimes including arson and burglary, AFP reported. The brothers' father was also on the FBI's most wanted list in the late 1960s after escaping from prison where he served time for bank robbery. Stephen Paddock opened fire on festival goers with semi-automatic weapons that were adapted to fire continuously from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel tower. It was the deadliest massacre in modern American history. More than 500 were injured, but Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo has conceded ""we may never know"" why the Mandalay Bay killer decided to carry out the devastating attack, before killing himself."

Theresa May said: ""It is only by making this an everyday concern for everyone that we change the way we see mental illness so that striving to improve your mental health - whether at work or at home - is seen as just as positive as improving our physical wellbeing."" The independent review into workplace mental health has been written by Lord Dennis Stevenson and Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind and chair of the NHS Mental Health Taskforce. Among its recommendations to the public sector and large employers: :: Produce, implement and communicate a mental health at work plan :: Develop mental health awareness among employees :: Encourage open conversations about mental health and the support available when employees are struggling :: Provide employees with good working conditions and ensure they have a healthy work life balance and opportunities for development :: Promote effective people management through line managers and supervisors :: Monitor employee mental health and wellbeing Mr Farmer told Sky News: ""There's a really strong business case that shows if you invest in your people and the mental health of your staff there are huge economic benefits to be had both for employers for the public sector and the state and the economy as a whole."" Andy Woodcock used to be a high-flying salesman for a luxury car dealership. But when he suffered anxiety and depression linked to his job, he was offered little help or support from his bosses. He was repeatedly signed off work by his GP and was eventually made redundant.

At times it is random, imprecise, unfair; what applies to one person seldom applies to all, and there seems to be a blatant indifference to the rule of law. Harvey Weinstein has been accused by more than 40 women of either sexual harassment, sexual assault or even rape - but he has denied the allegations against him and has yet to be charged with any offence. However, the Academy, it seems, felt pressured to react to the dozens of stars who were ""shocked and disgusted"" by his alleged behaviour, and on Sunday announced it was banning the film mogul. The group, which has more than 8,000 members, said the film producer ""does not merit the respect of his colleagues"". :: Hollywood's PR machine and its secret scandal BAFTA was even swifter, making the announcement just five days after the New York Times published its first expose. ""While BAFTA has previously been a beneficiary of Mr Weinstein's support for its charitable work, it considers the reported alleged behaviour completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA's values,"" the organisation said. Without going into the details of legal procedures, where everyone is innocent until proven guilty - yawn, right? - how do the good folks at the British Academy Of Film and Television Arts feel about running a retrospective on Roman Polanski? :: 'An overcrowded brothel': Hollywood's infamous casting couch In 1978, the French-Polish director admitted the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. Twenty-five years later, he won both best director and best film for The Pianist at the BAFTA awards. He also won best director at the Oscars. Whatever problems these institutions have with the Weinstein claims, they didn't have with Polanski. The British Film Institute was not as quick to condemn Weinstein, but has now withdrawn the fellowship awarded to him in 2002. ""Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" the BFI said in a statement. ""Everyone working in the film industry - in any industry - should be safe and respected in the workplace."" By acting like this, of both judge and jury of accused filmmakers, actors or producers, film institutions risk being dragged into the spotlight by the industry and the media. The most sensible thing to do would be to write up a code of conduct for members to protect actors from casting couch-type situations. The BFI has now promised to do so, incorporating it in its diversity standards. They should wait for court proceedings, if any, to be over to make any sort of decision regarding members - or risk fuelling a lynch mob-like mentality, with subjects trialled by their peers and social media before they are even charged with an offence.

A total of 27 people across the UK, Belgium and Bulgaria have been detained as part of the operation, which authorities say is continuing. The investigation, which is being co-ordinated by the Immigration Enforcement unit at the Home Office, is aimed at disrupting the organised crime networks behind human trafficking. Some 200 officers took part in the raids, codenamed operation Halifax. Those being smuggled are thought to have been mainly from Afghanistan, with some also from Pakistan and Vietnam. The gang allegedly used specially-adapted vans and trucks to travel across Europe and into Britain. The illegal trade is worth many millions of pounds to the traffickers, who charge between £7,000 and £10,000 for each illegal immigrant they smuggle into the UK. ""This international investigation is targeting an organised network suspected of being involved in a systematic attempt to evade the UK's immigration controls,"" said Steve Dann, director of criminal and financial investigation at the Home Office. ""People smuggling is a cruel and dangerous trade in which often vulnerable individuals are treated as commodities. ""Many are passed into the hands of other crime gangs who would seek to exploit them for modern slavery purposes, including labour exploitation and the illicit sex trade. ""We have been working closely with law enforcement colleagues across Europe and that vital co-operation will continue as the investigation proceeds with the evidence we have seized today."" The arrest operation in the UK was supported by officers from the National Crime Agency. The NCA's Chris Hogben said: ""Criminal gangs often facilitate the arrival of illegal migrants into the UK by exploiting their desperation without thought for safety and with the sole motive of profit. ""We see this through migrants being sent across the channel in unseaworthy small boats or stuffed into the back of cramped lorries, vans and cars. ""This operation is a good example of how we can bring together law enforcement from across Europe to work together to take on that threat and disrupt the organised networks involved in people smuggling."" Home Office Minister Brandon Lewis said the investigation highlighted the determination of authorities here and elsewhere in Europe to work together to go after those involved in this type of organised criminality. Those arrested on Thursday have been taken to a number of police stations in London, Birmingham and Gateshead for questioning. Authorities say it is likely other arrests will follow."

Self-harming reached a record level, too, in the 12 months to June 2017, with 41,103 incidents recorded. Justice Secretary David Lidington said he was ""under no illusions"" about the challenges prison staff face. A 9% increase in the final quarter led to the record number of assaults on staff. A figure of 2,011 incidents is a new quarterly high, too. The number of prisoner-on-prisoner assaults reached 19,678 - another record. But the number of deaths in custody in the year to September fell by 24 to 300. Of those, 77 were self-inflicted, down 33 from the previous year. Sky's Home Affairs Correspondent, Mark White, said the number of prison officers had fallen by about 5,000 since 2010. But he added that a government recruitment drive was currently focused on employing an additional 2,500 officers. Body-worn cameras are being used in an effort to reduce violence, after being successfully trialled with police forces. Justice Secretary David Lidington said: ""Our prison staff work incredibly hard and I am under no illusions about the challenges they face. ""More officers on the wings will improve the safety of our prisons. That is why we are investing £100 million to boost the front line."" Mr Lidington added: ""We have already recruited 1,290 extra prison officers over the past year, taking us over half way to our target, but we won't stop there. ""I am also determined to give officers the tools they need to manage violent offenders, investing £2m in body-worn cameras which will act as a visible deterrent against violence and assist with prosecutions, as well as introducing new-style handcuffs and piloting PAVA incapacitant spray. ""Violence against our dedicated staff will never be tolerated which is why I am supporting a bill to increase sentences for those who attack emergency workers, including prison officers. ""I have been clear that it will take time, but I am determined to tackle the issues that undermine prison safety."""
2017-10-26,"The Government have been warned Tory MPs are ""deadly serious"" about rebelling on key Brexit legislation unless ministers legally commit to Parliament having the final say on a departure deal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171026140106/http://news.sky.com/story/david-davis-uncertain-when-brexit-deal-vote-will-happen-11099152,"Former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan challenged Brexit Secretary David Davis to accept a tabled amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which would ensure MPs and peers the right to approve the terms of Britain's withdrawal. Labour also demanded a ""cast-iron guarantee"" on Parliament voting before the UK formally leaves the EU in March 2019. It has been confirmed the EU Withdrawal Bill will return to Parliament for a fresh House of Commons showdown on 14 November, when MPs will consider some of the near-400 amendments tabled to the legislation. The Government is reported to have delayed the bill's progress as ministers consider how to respond to the proposed changes, many of which have been backed by senior Tories. The number of amendments has raised suggestions Theresa May could even be defeated on the legislation, which aims to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK at the time Britain exits the bloc. Mrs Morgan's challenge to Mr Davis came as the Brexit Secretary was forced to appear before MPs after sowing confusion with his previous suggestion the House of Commons and House of Lords might only vote on a final Brexit agreement after Britain has left the EU. Answering an urgent question from Labour's Sir Keir Starmer, Mr Davis reiterated it is the Government's ""aim"" for Parliament to vote on both a divorce deal and the UK's future relationship with the EU before the end of March 2019. But, he added: ""Of course this vote cannot happen until there is a deal to vote upon. ""We're working to reach an agreement on a final deal in good time before we leave the EU in March 2019. ""Clearly we cannot say for certain at this stage when this will be agreed."" Mr Davis highlighted how both he and EU lead negotiator Michel Barnier are aiming to reach a draft agreement by October 2018 in order for the deal to be ratified in Brussels and across European capitals, including London. However, ex-education secretary Mrs Morgan told Mr Davis to accept her Tory colleague Dominic Grieve's amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which would commit the Government's promise of a parliamentary vote to law. She said: ""Reports have reached members on this side that the Secretary of State doesn't think that those Conservative members who have signed that amendment are serious about supporting it if we need to. ""Can I tell him we are deadly serious, and it would be better for the Government to adopt a concession strategy on having a withdrawal agreement secured by statute sooner rather than later for all concerned."" The Brexit Secretary replied: ""I won't pre-empt the discussions in the bill, but those reports are not true."" Sir Keir accused Mr Davis of overseeing a ""mess"" following seemingly contradictory statements from both the Brexit Secretary and Prime Minister on Wednesday. The shadow Brexit secretary said it would be ""wholly unacceptable"" for the European Parliament to vote on a Brexit deal without MPs and peers having their own say, as he demanded a ""cast-iron guarantee that will not happen""."

She said the trip was a present for her 30th birthday, booked by her partner before the snap General Election was called and she became an MP. The now-representative for North West Durham said she got permission from party whips, and insisted that a debate on the Government's controversial welfare programme was only secured after she left the country. Ms Pidcock wrote on Facebook: ""I was gutted not to be taking part, having made several intervention on Universal Credit in the past, and fought hard to get the Government to pause this disastrous roll-out"". When the @MailOnline were phoning me yesterday, I declined to answer, but I do want to say some words in explanation to my constituents. pic.twitter.com/TgaxQZ0L2t ""I tweeted from Italy in the lead up and during the debate because, naturally, I was keeping up to speed with what was happening in the Chamber."" She added: ""If I had known the Universal Credit debate was being tabled, I probably would not have gone either, even without there being a vote. ""I take my responsibilities very seriously."" Ms Pidcock had been criticised for missing the debate after Labour slammed a Tory MP for skipping a previous vote on the matter to referee a football match. Minister Andrew Percy told The Sun: ""Even hypocrisy itself would be embarrassed at this shameful hypocrisy. ""Issues such as benefits might all be a big political game for MPs like Laura Pidcock but for millions of people in this country they are a serious issue. ""The least Laura Pidcock could have done is to turn up to the debate she previously criticised others for missing."" Labour's opposition day debate on Universal Credit the previous week was passed unanimously by 299 votes, as Tory whips had ordered their MPs to abstain. Only one Conservative, Sarah Wollaston, joined the SNP and Liberal Democrats to back call to ""pause"" its roll-out."
2017-10-26,"The First Minister of Wales has warned of a constitutional crisis that would threaten the ""fabric of the UK"" if the Government refuses to respond to concerns of the Welsh and Scottish administrations and change its EU Withdrawal Bill.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171026140106/http://news.sky.com/story/welsh-first-minister-scrap-the-eu-withdrawal-bill-or-risk-devolution-crisis-11098626,"Carwyn Jones told Sky News the will of Welsh voters as expressed in devolution referendums in 1997 and 2011 were ""as valid"" as last year's Brexit referendum, and urged the Government not to ""hijack"" powers from Brussels that, he says, should go to the devolved governments. It comes as Brexit Secretary David Davis faces calls from those within his own party in Scotland and Wales to rethink the devolution aspects of the Bill. Clause 11 of the Withdrawal Bill would see powers currently held by the EU related to devolved policy areas - such as agriculture, environment and fisheries - returned initially to Westminster rather than Cardiff, Holyrood and Stormont. The Government says this is necessary to ensure regulatory consistency in the UK's internal market, but has insisted that ultimately devolved administrations will end with more powers after Brexit. Although talks between UK ministers and their counterparts from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have resulted in agreement on the principles for a coordinated approach to preserve the internal market, the first ministers of Scotland and Wales have remained united in their opposition to the Government's legislation. ""What the Bill says is that powers that would come from Brussels to Wales will be hijacked and taken straight to Whitehall for an indefinite period. Now we clearly can't support that,"" Mr Jones told Sky News. While a rejection of the Bill by the devolved powers would not be legally binding on the UK Government, the First Minster warned there would be serious implications if those positions were ignored. ""If we withhold consent and they override that consent, that creates a crisis in terms of the fabric of the UK,"" the politician said. More Brexit Forensics:: Nuclear industry prepares for 'no deal' Brexit:: How gold takes the shine off Britain's trade balance ""We've had two referendums here in Wales, where the Welsh people have decided they want to have an Assembly, and that we should have substantial powers and law-making powers. Those referendums are as valid as the Brexit referendum. ""If you were to say to people on the street, did you vote for powers to disappear to Westminster rather than come to Wales, I suspect most people would say we want them to come to Wales."" The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, described the First Minister's position as ""farcical"", but acknowledged some tweaks might still be needed to the EU Withdrawal Bill. ""There is a concern, a debate to be had, about how long these powers will be held in Westminster, but to take the position that (Scottish First Minister) Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones have taken, which is outright opposition, really is a farcical position to take,"" said Mr Davies. ""When you think of all these powers at the moment, they're held in Brussels anyway, they're managed by a bureaucracy that isn't elected by anyone. And ultimately they will be returning to a sovereign parliament in Westminster who want to pass these powers on to the devolved governments and parliaments of the United Kingdom"", he added. However, one of the new crop of Scottish Tory MPs has told Sky News concerns over the devolution impact are ""not unfounded"". While they are unlikely to rebel at this stage, it is a sign the Government could yet face pressure to change the Bill from its own ranks north of the border, potentially with a compromise that would place a so-called 'sunset clause' on how long Westminster would retain EU powers related to devolved areas. ""I want to know if the Scottish Conservatives are truly Scottish Conservatives or are they just lobby fodder for Theresa May's disastrous hard Brexit,"" said Stephen Gethins, the SNP's foreign affairs and Brexit spokesman in the House of Commons. The next stage of the Withdrawal Bill's progress through Parliament has been delayed while the Government considers how best to respond to the hundreds of proposed amendments tabled by MPs on a range of issues, including the impact on devolution. Mr Gethins, who has tabled several amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill that reflect the positions of the Welsh and Scottish governments, said it was time the Government scrapped the legislation in its current form and took a cross-party approach. ""This is a mess, plain and simple. It's a legal mess, a constitutional mess, and a political mess, and it impacts on all of us. What I'd like to see the Government do is go back to the drawing board, this is too big for one party. Consult with the other administrations, consult with the other political parties, it's too big for one party,"" he told Sky News. In an appearance in front of the Scottish Affairs select committee this week, Scotland Secretary David Mundell confirmed the Government would hold an ""amendments forum"" in the coming weeks, with representatives from the devolved administrations, to consider proposals for changes to the Bill. ""We've been quite clear that we would look at all amendments seriously, in good faith, and that they were brought forward not to wreck the bill but brought forward to make the bill better, more in line with achieving its objectives, and that's what we're doing,"" he said."

LA's Superior Court was told on Wednesday the singer now claims he also drugged her. One of Belafonte's lawyers, Philip Cohen, said: ""Miss Brown now takes the position she was drugged by Mr Belafonte throughout the course of the marriage."" The singer, 42, alleged she was drugged throughout ""much to most"" of the relationship during a recent out-of-court testimony, Mr Cohen added. Belafonte, also 42, is accused of tormenting Brown with years of mental and physical abuse. The pair have been undergoing a bitter split and preliminary hearings ahead of their full divorce have heard allegations from both sides. Belafonte has claimed Brown has suffered from cocaine and alcohol addiction, describing it as a ""major issue"" in their marriage. It has also been claimed that Brown led an ""extravagant"" lifestyle and had ""wiped out"" a $50m ($39m) fortune she accumulated during her Spice Girls years.. Brown married Belafonte, a film producer, in Las Vegas in June 2007. She filed for divorce in March, citing irreconcilable differences and detailing allegations of domestic abuse. Belafonte's lawyers have dismissed her claims as ""nothing more than a smear campaign"". A trial on the domestic violence allegations has been delayed and will now begin on 6 November ahead of the full divorce case. Leeds-born Brown shot to fame in the 1990s as Scary Spice, and had a reality show called It's A Scary World which documented her life with Belafonte and their children and step-children."

The bank said these factors helped offset a ""difficult"" period in its markets operation, where income fell 14% to £3.5bn thanks to lower trading volumes and volatility compared to a busy third quarter last year. Chief executive Jes Staley told investors it was the first set of results the bank had released since the completion of its post-crisis restructuring - describing the three months to 30 September as ""particularly significant"". He said: ""We now have high confidence in our capacity to assert when Barclays will start to deliver the economic performance which we know this group is capable of, and therefore today we are announcing new targets for 2019 and 2020 for Barclays."" Mr Staley said they were aimed at growing returns for shareholders - an area that had been a source of frustration for the bank ahead of the sacking of Antony Jenkins in 2015. Investors, though, did not seem that impressed and Barclays closed more than 7% lower on the FTSE 100. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: ""After making some good progress, Barclays appears to be stalling somewhat."" Mr Staley has further worries - chief among them an investigation by regulators over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower at the bank. Barclays made no further comment on the affair in its results but confirmed it was on track to meet regulatory demands on ring-fencing its UK retail and investment bank operations by 2019. It said it was submitting plans to the authorities aimed at meeting rules designed to ensure there is no repeat of the threat posed to retail deposits during the financial crisis. The lender said: ""Barclays intends to satisfy this requirement by setting up a ring-fenced bank, Barclays Bank UK PLC, which will be separate from Barclays Bank PLC. ""The two entities will operate alongside, but independently from, one another as part of the Barclays Group under Barclays PLC."""

Police arrested a different man, Khurram Rahi, 27, from Smethwick, in connection with the first rape at the end of July, and he appeared in court in August. Officers are now hoping to find the man who took the girl home safely, believing he may have more information about that night.

2017-10-26,One of these days we might stop caring about Gross Domestic Product (GDP).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171026140106/http://news.sky.com/story/interest-rate-rise-looms-next-month-after-lift-in-economic-growth-11097838,"After all, it is difficult to know where to begin with the statistic's flaws. While it is the broadest measure of economic performance (at least, the broadest measure available within a few months) it is still disappointingly narrow. It is blind to social performance, it notches up natural disasters as economic boosts and takes little account of innovation, new products, inequality, the sharing economy and other social yardsticks. :: Economic growth accelerates in third quarter And who knows: perhaps in future we will be focusing on a totally different measure of growth, such as the ones proposed by Diane Coyle, Benjamin Mitra-Kahn and Jonathan Haskel for the Indigo Prize on finding a replacement for GDP. In the meantime, though, GDP is what matters. It is GDP which hogs the headlines. It is GDP which many people view as the ultimate yardstick of whether Britain is in recession (two successive quarters of shrinking GDP equals a recession - at least according to the conventional wisdom). It is GDP which most politicians fixate on when they're looking for a measure of how well the economy is doing. So what's the answer: how well is it doing? The answer is: well, it depends. On the one hand, the figures are stronger than had been expected by economists, who had been anticipating growth of just 0.3%. Moreover, save for the construction sector, which had a dismal quarter (but is quite volatile at the best of times), this was pretty broad based growth. The manufacturing and services sectors are both growing - though the latter, which contributes about 80% of total GDP, is still growing at well below its historical rate - 0.4%, compared with 0.8% in the years before the financial crisis. And that brings us to the broader concern. While these figures are stronger than the City had expected, they are nonetheless, considerably weaker than the UK's normal, trend rate of expansion. Normally you'd hope for the economy to grow by about 0.7% a quarter. It hasn't achieved anything like that since late 2015. Indeed, these figures mean Britain has had the worst three quarters since 2013, and the worst first three quarters of a calendar year since 2009. One question economists will be asking themselves is whether this is the new normal: is Britain transitioning to a lower normal rate of growth? If so, that would have enormous consequences for all of us. Weak growth means less income shared among us, which means less prosperity and (a worry for the Chancellor) less tax revenue. And less tax revenue in turn means the potential for more austerity. A final consequence of the stronger-than-expected numbers is the implications for monetary policy. At present the majority of economists and investors expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 0.5% at their meeting next week - the first increase since the financial crisis. The fact that GDP is going up faster than anticipated will only increase the likelihood - after all, a stronger economy implies more inflation which puts pressure on the Monetary Policy Committee - to lift interest rates."

He allegedly entered her room, began masturbating and implied she would get a film role if she had sex with him. :: Weinstein: The women behind the claims Malthe, now 43, said:"" I was sitting on the bed talking to Harvey when he pushed me back and forced himself on me, it was not consensual.

He was awarded the honour for outstanding contribution to the British film industry in 2004. The latest allegations against him from Malthe follow an announcement by actress Dominique Huett that she is suing the film studio co-founded by Weinstein after her own allegation of rape. The Blue Bloods actress claims Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her and then carried out another sexual act in front of her. In a £3.8m negligence lawsuit, Huett accuses The Weinstein Company's ""executives, officers and employers had actual knowledge of (Harvey) Weinstein's repeated acts of sexual misconduct with women"".

Its efforts include the trial of new store formats and a makeover of its online sales platform. Debenhams said it had also endured a much tougher second half in trading terms, as shoppers' budgets came under further pressure from inflation outpacing wage growth.

It said shutting the two sites would affect 80 jobs though it was hoped the staff could be mostly redeployed.

Commenting on the manufacturing figures, SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""With UK car manufacturing falling for a fifth month this year, it's clear that declining consumer and business confidence is affecting domestic demand and hence production volumes. ""Uncertainty regarding the national air quality plans also didn't help the domestic market for diesel cars, despite the fact that these new vehicles will face no extra charges or restrictions across the UK. ""Brexit is the greatest challenge of our times and yet we still don't have any clarity on what our future relationship with our biggest trading partner will look like, nor detail of the transitional deal being sought. ""Leaving the EU with no deal would be the worst outcome for our sector so we urge government to deliver on its commitments and safeguard the competitiveness of the industry."""

Branding it a ""major obstacle blocking the potential success of the policy"", the cross-party group said there was evidence the delay led to ""an increase in acute financial difficulty"". They cited reports of overwhelmed food banks, problem debt, steeply rising rent arrears and homelessness as reasons for cutting the wait period to a month for first payments. ""Most low-income families simply do not have the savings to see them through this extended period without resorting to desperate measures,"" the committee's report stated. The committee welcomed the increased availability of advance payment loans but said they were ""no solution to a fundamental flaw"" in the design of Universal Credit. The call will heap further pressure on Theresa May over the full roll-out of Universal Credit, which is aimed at simplifying the benefits system by replacing six different benefits with a single payment. The committee's chair, Labour MP Frank Field, branded the six-week wait for payments ""cruel"", adding: ""No one can give us any real justification for it. ""Such a long wait bears no relation to anyone's working life and the terrible hardship it has been proven to cause actually makes it more difficult for people to find work. ""It is not too late for the Government to avert a Christmas disaster. They must act now."" Last week, a non-binding Labour motion calling for the Universal Credit roll-out to be paused was passed in the House of Commons, with Tory MPs ordered to skip the vote. Heidi Allen, one of six Conservatives on the committee, said: ""To truly represent the world of work, the payment cycle must mirror how the majority of people are paid, i.e. monthly."" On Wednesday, the Prime Minister assured MPs the Government ""have been listening"" to concerns raised over Universal Credit and that ""changes have been made"". Responding to the committee's report, the Department for Work and Pensions highlighted how help is available for those who need it within the six-week period. A spokesperson said: ""The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time but no one who needs support has to wait six weeks. ""When people apply for Universal Credit they are advised about the maximum advance they can receive, and that they can repay over six months. ""Once we know someone needs an advance, they can get it within five days or on the same day if they are in urgent need."" Currently, 8% of benefits claimants are on Universal Credit, with this planned to rise to 10% by the end of January as the Government aims to complete the full roll-out by 2022."

Police used tear gas to disperse angry mobs in Kibera, a slum in the capital Nairobi, while in Kisumu, Kenya's third biggest city and an opposition stronghold, live rounds and water cannon were also fired. August's poll was annulled by the Supreme Court after finding illegalities and irregularities in the election process. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, who was re-elected by a small but comfortable majority, urged people to vote, pledging the deployment of security forces nationwide to ensure order. :: Opposition leader plunges Kenya into a political crisis But opposition leader Raila Odinga called for a boycott of the fresh poll, announcing a ""resistance movement"" and the establishment of a ""people's assembly"" as a parallel government. His call appears to have resonated with voters in some areas, with local media anticipating a lower turnout this time around, even by supporters of Mr Kenyetta, who is seeking a second term. Some polling stations in opposition strongholds did not open on Thursday, while voting in Mr Kenyatta's hometown of Gatundu and other areas was marred by heavy rains and power cuts. Supporters of Mr Odinga, leader of the National Super Alliance (Nasa) who has lost three previous elections claiming fraud in two of them, blocked roads leading to some polling stations in Kisumu to prevent residents from voting. Officials cited fear of attacks for the failure to deliver voting equipment to some polling stations in the region which remained locked and chained. ""So far, we have not deployed any material, and we have not deployed election officials. The reason is security,"" said returning officer John Ngutai. ""We hope to be able to deploy later in the day. We hope for the best but prepare for the worst. The worst would be no election officials."" Waiting to cast his vote in Mathare, another of the capital's slums, David Njeru said: ""It is my duty to vote. ""Last time the queue was all around the block and I waited six hours to vote, this time the people are few,"" added the 26-year-old taxi driver. After a night of heavy downpours, only 50 people stood on the boggy grass outside the Redeemed Gospel Church polling station, where more than 8,000 are registered to vote.

After weeks of trials, today they will put the car through its paces at Newquay Airport in Cornwall. The two runway trials come after a series of tests to check the car's steering, brakes, suspension and data systems, as well as the efficiency of the intake feeding air to the EJ200 jet engine, sourced from a Eurofighter Typhoon. The landmark moment in the high-profile project comes 20 years after the current land speed world record was set on 15 October, 1997. Many of those who set that record are back to break it, including Wing Commander Andy Green who drove Thrust SSC (Super Sonic Car) in the Arizona desert, making history as the first person to breach the sound barrier at 763.035 mph. The ultimate aim of Bloodhound SSC is to not only break that record but reach a knuckle-whitening 1000mph in the South Africa desert. During the trials in Cornwall, Mr Green and his team will push the car up to around 200mph to check its progress. Mr Green said he will be particularly watching the car's aerodynamics to see how it copes at high speed. ""Every single test run we do will be increasing the speed and I'll be watching at every stage the downloads on the wheels,"" he said. ""If they're getting too low, we'll abort, if they're getting too high, we'll abort. I'll be watching the instruments all the time."" The tests will also give the team an idea of how their engine systems work. Bloodhound uses a Typhoon fighter jet engine to get up to around 350mph before a Jaguar V8 muscle car engine kicks in to supply fuel to a rocket which propels the car to over 1000mph. In total, Bloodhound SSC will have eight times the power of all the cars on an F1 grid. That's the theory, but first the car will have to pass the Newquay Airport tests later."
2017-10-26,Bombardier is to cut 280 jobs at its Belfast operations as the company's trade row with US rival Boeing continues to simmer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171026140106/http://news.sky.com/story/bombardier-cuts-280-belfast-jobs-amid-boeing-trade-row-11099122,"It comes a week after Airbus had eased jobs fears after agreeing to take a majority stake in Bombardier's C-Series aircraft programme - the focus of the row. The passenger planes are facing a 220% tariff and further 80% levy as a result of a US state aid ruling - disputed by the company and the UK and Canadian governments. Canada-based Bombardier makes the wings for the C-Series in Belfast, where it currently employs 4,000 staff. But it said on Thursday: ""Following the 7,500 global workforce reductions announced by Bombardier Inc last October, we continue to review our manpower requirements in Belfast and regret to confirm that we must reduce our workforce levels by around 280. ""Those impacted will be functional support personnel, including managers and professional staff. ""We acknowledge the impact this will have on our workforce and their families and we continue to explore opportunities to help mitigate the number of compulsory redundancies. ""However, we need to continue to cut costs and improve the efficiency of our operations to help ensure our long-term competitiveness."" Bombardier's competitiveness was bolstered by its partnership with Airbus which will see US-bound C-Series planes assembled at Airbus US plants to avoid the 300% import tariffs. The company signalled that the latest job losses were not a direct result of the trade dispute but an element of its continuing five-year plan to grow profitability. It had cut 1,000 jobs in Belfast a year ago and a further 95 just last month. Davy Thompson, Unite regional coordinating officer, said: ""At a time when the unions and the broader Bombardier workforce in Northern Ireland are leading efforts to put the pressure on political leaders to use their leverage on Boeing and the US administration to rescind the 300% tariffs threatened on the C Series, it is very saddening that our efforts are rewarded by this announcement. ""Unite is calling on Bombardier to reconsider these redundancies and lift the threat to its workers in Northern Ireland at this time."""

""I have to repeat - sadly - that other criticism of Saudi Arabia in this Parliament is not helpful. I'll leave it there. ""But we need to do everything possible to encourage Saudi Arabia towards batch 2 - I think they will commit but we need to work away at the timing."" :: Saudi crown prince pledges to 'end extremism very soon' The deal, which was expected some months ago, might have been sufficient to ward off almost 2,000 job cuts announced by BAE Systems two weeks ago. The Defence Secretary's words were immediately jumped on by opposition parties. The SNP's defence spokesman Stewart McDonald MP tweeted: ""The Secretary of State is turning a blind eye to Saudi human rights abuses. SNP MPs will not do so."" Reprieve, the charity that works with individuals facing execution in Saudi Arabia, released a statement saying: ""It is chilling that our Defence Secretary sees fit to warn MPs not to criticise one of the world's worst human rights abusers. ""The Saudi government has executed hundreds in recent years, including children. ""Several juveniles and protesters are at imminent risk of death - and still, Britain lends strong support to Saudi security forces, who use torture to extract false confessions. ""It is perverse to suggest that these abuses, and the strong risk of British complicity, should escape parliamentary scrutiny. ""Mr Fallon must urgently explain himself to MPs and the public."" Andrew Smith, from the Campaign Against Arms Trade, said the comments were ""disgraceful"". ""He is calling on other parliamentarians to join him in putting arms sales ahead of human rights, democracy and international humanitarian law,"" Mr Smith said. ""The Saudi regime has one of the most appalling human rights records in the world, and has inflicted a terrible humanitarian catastrophe on Yemen. ""Fallon should be doing all he can to stop the bloodshed and end UK complicity in the suffering, not urging his colleagues to willingly ignore the abuses in order to sell even more weapons."" A Conservative Party source said that Sir Michael was specifically referring to Labour MPs and the party's last-minute decision to ban Saudi representatives wishing to attend the Labour Party Conference."

Gang leader Jetlind Gjyriqi claimed he could move as many as 20 illegal migrants per month, including some who had previously been removed from the UK and were trying to get back in. Scott Downie and Anthony Corkovic hatched a plan to hand over Albanians in Belgium to a person who they thought would take them to the UK. In the gang's first attempted handover in August, six migrants under the control of two Albanian men arrived by car at a lay-by in Oostkamp. The six then jumped into a second vehicle which was actually an undercover van. The migrants were detained and later deported while the two Albanian men accompanying them drove off but were later arrested and prosecuted in Belgium. Downie, 31, and 28-year-old Corkovic, of Salford, and Gjyriqi, 31, of Merton, south-west London, were arrested in the UK by National Crime Agency officers. Downie and Corkovic were each jailed for seven years while Gjyriqi was sentenced to five years and two months behind bars.

Ms Sturgeon highlighted the Prime Minister's comments to the House of Commons this week, in which Mrs May appeared to suggest a transition deal could only be agreed once the terms of Britain's future relationship are known. In her letter, the SNP leader called for ""absolute clarity"" that the Government is ""urgently seeking"" a transition arrangement of ""at least"" two years and that ministers are aiming to strike a deal on an interim period by the end of the year. Ms Sturgeon also wants Mrs May to declare such a deal will be based on current EU rules as a ""steady state transition"" and an interim arrangement will not be conditional on a final agreement on Britain's future relationship with the EU. The First Minister added she is ""increasingly concerned"" Brexit negotiations may end with no agreement between the UK and EU. Ms Sturgeon told the Prime Minister: ""No Brexit would be preferable to no deal - or indeed a bad deal."" In a no deal scenario, Ms Sturgeon demanded the Scottish Parliament must have its own say. Brexit Secretary David Davis offered a clarification of Mrs May's remarks later this week, telling a committee of MPs he expects the outline of a transitional period to be agreed within the first three months of 2018. The Government has been warned businesses need certainty over an interim Brexit deal by the end of March next year - 12 months before Britain's scheduled departure from the EU - otherwise they could begin to put in place contingency plans and possibly move jobs abroad. Downing Street confirmed Ms Sturgeon's letter had been received and would be replied to ""thoroughly"" in due course. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn voiced his opposition to a second referendum on Britain's EU membership once the shape of a Brexit deal is known, claiming the issue should be dealt with by MPs. Speaking to London Mayor Sadiq Khan on LBC Radio, Mr Corbyn said: ""The idea of a second referendum is something that many people want but many are very concerned about because they don't think it would actually solve the issue. ""I think that the issue has to be dealt with by negotiation and by a meaningful vote in Parliament on what it is. ""We are in the middle of an Article 50 process, therefore we have declared we are leaving the EU."" Mr Khan has previously suggested a second EU vote could be held if Parliament rejects the final Brexit deal, as that possibility would open up ""a whole host of questions""."

When officers searched their car, they discovered a purpose built concealed compartment, in which ten Russian-made Baikal handguns, ten silencers and around 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition were hidden. The men were arrested and questioned by investigators from the National Crime Agency (NCA). Aivaras Vysniauskas claimed to have been living in Great Yarmouth before returning to Lithuania and said he had bought the car himself. He said he had built the hidden panel around the vehicle's transmission and had put the firearms, silencers and ammunition in there. Gytis Vysniauskas denied any knowledge of the weapons, but tests showed that his DNA was on one of the guns. The guns had been modified to fire 9mm ammunition, the barrels had been threaded to fit a silencer and each gun had its serial number filed off. Aivaras Vysniauskas admitted importing the firearms when he appeared in court in April 2016, but Gytis Vysniauskas denied involvement. He was found guilty of importing firearms at Canterbury Crown Court after a trial on 24 October. On Friday, Aivaras Vysniauskas was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and Gytis Vysniauskas was jailed for 15 years.

It will examine areas such as search result rankings, ""pressure selling"", hidden charges, and discount claims. If it finds sites are false or misleading and breaking consumer law, the CMA could take enforcement action. The CMA has written to companies across the whole sector asking for information about their practices and is also calling on customers and hotels to share their experiences. The watchdog will examine practices such as how hotels are ranked after a customer has made a search - and whether this is influenced by a commission paid by the hotel. It will also look at ""pressure selling"", and whether claims about how many people are looking at the same room, how many rooms are left, and how long a price is available, may create a false impression or rush customers into making a decision. Claims about discounts are to be reviewed to see if they offer a fair comparison, as will the issue of hidden charges such as taxes or booking fees which customers may be faced with in addition to the prices they are first shown. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said: ""Around 70% of people who shopped around for hotels last year used these sites and they should all be confident they have chosen the best accommodation for their needs and are getting a good deal."" He added: ""In today's increasingly busy world, sites like this offer real potential to help holiday-makers save time and money searching for their ideal get-away. ""To do this, sites need to give their customers information that is clear, accurate and presented in a way that enables people to choose the best deal for them. ""But we are concerned that this is not happening and that the information on sites may in fact be making it difficult for people to make the right choice."" The CMA expects to report back on the investigation by next spring. Any enforcement action could include asking websites to change their practices, obtaining a court order for them to do so and eventually a significant fine. No specific sites have been named by the CMA. Leading operators in the sector include booking.com, Expedia, Trivago and hotels.com. Trivago said in a statement that it would ""work with the CMA to explain the benefits it delivers to consumers looking for their ideal hotel""."

2017-10-28,One of these days we might stop caring about Gross Domestic Product (GDP).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171028043208/http://news.sky.com/story/interest-rate-rise-looms-next-month-after-lift-in-economic-growth-11097838,"After all, it is difficult to know where to begin with the statistic's flaws. While it is the broadest measure of economic performance (at least, the broadest measure available within a few months) it is still disappointingly narrow. It is blind to social performance, it notches up natural disasters as economic boosts and takes little account of innovation, new products, inequality, the sharing economy and other social yardsticks. :: Economic growth accelerates in third quarter And who knows: perhaps in future we will be focusing on a totally different measure of growth, such as the ones proposed by Diane Coyle, Benjamin Mitra-Kahn and Jonathan Haskel for the Indigo Prize on finding a replacement for GDP. In the meantime, though, GDP is what matters. It is GDP which hogs the headlines. It is GDP which many people view as the ultimate yardstick of whether Britain is in recession (two successive quarters of shrinking GDP equals a recession - at least according to the conventional wisdom). It is GDP which most politicians fixate on when they're looking for a measure of how well the economy is doing. So what's the answer: how well is it doing? The answer is: well, it depends. On the one hand, the figures are stronger than had been expected by economists, who had been anticipating growth of just 0.3%. Moreover, save for the construction sector, which had a dismal quarter (but is quite volatile at the best of times), this was pretty broad based growth. The manufacturing and services sectors are both growing - though the latter, which contributes about 80% of total GDP, is still growing at well below its historical rate - 0.4%, compared with 0.8% in the years before the financial crisis. And that brings us to the broader concern. While these figures are stronger than the City had expected, they are nonetheless, considerably weaker than the UK's normal, trend rate of expansion. Normally you'd hope for the economy to grow by about 0.7% a quarter. It hasn't achieved anything like that since late 2015. Indeed, these figures mean Britain has had the worst three quarters since 2013, and the worst first three quarters of a calendar year since 2009. One question economists will be asking themselves is whether this is the new normal: is Britain transitioning to a lower normal rate of growth? If so, that would have enormous consequences for all of us. Weak growth means less income shared among us, which means less prosperity and (a worry for the Chancellor) less tax revenue. And less tax revenue in turn means the potential for more austerity. A final consequence of the stronger-than-expected numbers is the implications for monetary policy. At present the majority of economists and investors expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 0.5% at their meeting next week - the first increase since the financial crisis. The fact that GDP is going up faster than anticipated will only increase the likelihood - after all, a stronger economy implies more inflation which puts pressure on the Monetary Policy Committee - to lift interest rates."

Twenty-five years later, he won both best director and best film for The Pianist at the BAFTA awards. He also won best director at the Oscars. Whatever problems these institutions have with the Weinstein claims, they didn't have with Polanski. The British Film Institute was not as quick to condemn Weinstein, but has now withdrawn the fellowship awarded to him in 2002. ""Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" the BFI said in a statement. ""Everyone working in the film industry - in any industry - should be safe and respected in the workplace."" By acting like this, of both judge and jury of accused filmmakers, actors or producers, film institutions risk being dragged into the spotlight by the industry and the media. The most sensible thing to do would be to write up a code of conduct for members to protect actors from casting couch-type situations. The BFI has now promised to do so, incorporating it in its diversity standards. They should wait for court proceedings, if any, to be over to make any sort of decision regarding members - or risk fuelling a lynch mob-like mentality, with subjects trialled by their peers and social media before they are even charged with an offence. Granted, Weinstein could end up facing a jury one day, and I'm certainly not defending him - but we shouldn't be treating him as a criminal either. Not yet, anyway."

Officers believe what happened outside the venue was preceded by an altercation inside. The Met Police said further footage, which has not been released, shows the vehicle making several more manoeuvres, ""deliberately targeting pedestrians"", before driving away towards Lewisham. PC Gary Sanders described it as a ""very serious incident"" that could have had ""fatal consequences"". It was ""a potential offence of attempted murder"", police added. The man is believed to have been knocked unconscious. The victim, however, walked away and has never come forward. Police have released images of him from inside the bar. On the night in question, police and the London Ambulance Service arrived at the scene at about 3am after being alerted by council CCTV operators. But they were unable to find anyone who had been injured and were told by those still there that nothing significant had happened. Two young women suffered bruising and took themselves to hospital before being discharged shortly afterwards. Sometime after the incident, officers spotted a vehicle and linked both it and the driver to the events in Catford. A 23-year-old man was arrested for attempted grievous bodily harm with intent on 5 October and subsequently charged. PC Sanders said: ""This was a very serious incident which could have had fatal consequences for the man involved. ""We are very concerned about what has taken place and would urge the victim - and anyone else with information - to contact us as soon as possible."" :: Anyone with information should call Lewisham CID on 07733 302868, via 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

On Friday, a judge in Mpumalanga sentenced Jackson to 14 years and Oosthuizen to 11 years. They had pleaded not guilty to an array of charges after a video showing them assaulting Mr Mlotshwa went viral in August 2016. In the video, Mr Mlotshwa begs for his life as he is pushed into the coffin by the two white farmers. One of the men pushes the lid of the coffin down while the other threatens to put petrol and a snake inside. They claimed he had tried to steal cables from their farm and threatened to kill their families and burn farm crops. Mr Mlotshwa was in court throughout the hearings, and was present at the sentencing. He denied stealing cables and claimed the two farmers picked him up as he tried to take a short cut. Judge Segopotje Mphahlele said: ""The most appalling act of the accused was to put the complainant in a coffin against his will. ""Whilst in the coffin they threatened to set it alight. They asked him how he wanted to die - quickly or slowly. ""The conduct of the accused... goes against the spirit of the constitution."" Defence lawyers have said the sentences were too harsh. Carel Taute, Jackson's lawyer, told Al Jazeera: ""The whole case is strange. Even the fact that it was taken to the High Court, when there was no murder. ""I find it ironic that the judge said that the judgement had to build relations within the community. I am afraid this will do the opposite."" The case prompted national outrage and sparked a debate over the legacy of apartheid, which ended in South Africa in 1994."
2017-10-28,"The head of Swiss banking giant UBS says its ""worst case scenario"" of having to shift 1,000 jobs out of London due to Brexit is looking unlikely.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171028043208/http://news.sky.com/story/ubs-boss-scales-down-worst-case-brexit-exodus-scenario-11100392,"Chief executive Sergio Ermotti said it planned to tell UK staff ""in the next few weeks"" where it would move positions as it plans for Britain's departure from the European Union. UBS had warned earlier this year that as many as 1,000 of its 5,000 positions in the capital might have to move. But Mr Ermotti told reporters on Friday that this number had in recent months become ""more and more unlikely"" since there had been ""more regulatory and political clarification about what we need to do"". He said his target was to ""keep as many people as we can in London"". The Swiss firm is one of several international lenders to warn that they are making contingency plans to shift jobs to the continent to ensure they can carry on serving European clients. That is largely due to the likelihood that Britain will lose 'passporting' rights enabling financial businesses to sell services freely in Europe. The UK is seeking a transitional arrangement to avoid a 'cliff-edge' change in the way businesses operate - though the City has become increasingly concerned that an agreement on this could come too late to stop contingency plans being triggered. UBS already has a bank in Frankfurt with the licences needed to serve wealth management and investment banking around Europe, and Mr Ermotti indicated that the question now was how the jobs are shared around the continent. He said: ""We are looking between a couple of countries like Spain or Holland still maybe having, on a branch basis, people operating from those locations under the licence of our Frankfurt-based bank."" The comments came as UBS reported a 14% rise in net profit for the third quarter to 946m Swiss francs. They are likely to be seized on by Leave supporters as evidence that the impact of Brexit on business will not be as dire as have been feared. The Treasury said: ""The Chancellor has made it clear that it is his priority to ensure the UK remains the financial services centre of the world. ""We will continue to work closely with the City to negotiate a transitional arrangement which avoids unnecessary disruption, and allows firms to adjust in an orderly way to the new arrangements after Britain leaves the EU."" HSBC is another bank that has warned it could move 1,000 jobs out of London. Earlier this month, Lloyd Blankfein, boss of Goldman Sachs, signalled that he would be spending a lot more time in Frankfurt as a result of Brexit, in a tweet. That came after the Wall Street bank, which employs 6,500 people in the UK, signed a lease to increase substantially its office space in Germany's financial centre."

According to The Sun, a WhatsApp group of female employees at Westminster is used to warn members about MPs and other senior figures from across the political parties. It follows allegations made about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein by a number of women working in Hollywood. A Number 10 spokeswoman said: ""Any reports of sexual harassment are deeply concerning. ""The Prime Minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behaviour is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life - including politics. ""Any allegations that may come to light will be taken extremely seriously and we would advise people to contact the police if there is such an allegation so that it's fully investigated."" The Prime Minister was said to be unaware of any allegations having been formally reported. Asked if claims about a minister would lead to their sacking by Mrs May, the spokeswoman added: ""She would take it extremely seriously and serious action would be taken where it's necessary."" Downing Street also advised allegations that may not warrant a police investigation could be made to House of Commons officials or party authorities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn welcomed the Prime Minister's comments, telling LBC Radio: ""There has to be a proper system of people, women in particular, being able to report if they've been abused in any way and have it dealt with in a timely and proper manner. ""Our party, the Labour Party, has a process of doing that both for employees of party officials, MPs and councillors, but also for party members who feel they've been abused in any way."" The reported WhatsApp group, said to include female researchers, secretaries and aides, is claimed to include warnings such as ""very handy"", ""not safe in taxis"" and ""groped my a*** at a drinks party"". I will be naming a Labour MP who behaved appalling towards a young woman to the chief whip and leader Why was her complaint ignored before? At the weekend, John Mann revealed he had named one of his fellow Labour MPs to Jeremy Corbyn and the party's chief whip. In apparently separate claims to those from the reported WhatsApp group, Mr Mann alleged the MP had ""behaved appallingly towards a young woman"". Posting on Twitter, he said: ""This case and a non-Labour one I have raised demonstrate a shocking lack of any system for dealing with this in Westminster."" The Harvey Weinstein scandal prompted a #MeToo campaign on social media, in which women spoke out about their own experiences of sexual harassment. Parliamentary officials said there is a free and confidential 24/7 helpline provided by the House of Commons for all MPs' staff. A House of Commons spokesperson said: ""The House of Commons takes the welfare of everyone who works in Parliament very seriously. ""The House is limited in its ability to intervene in employment matters, such as allegations of bullying or harassment by MPs of their staff as MPs are self-employed and employ their staff directly."""

She was left with serious injuries, and has said she ""should not have survived"". In a video statement to the police, a month after the near fatal fall, she spoke of her shock at finding out the cause of the incident. ""It's not really a conceivable accident. You can't categorically say it was, but never in the history of parachuting worldwide has it happened,"" she said. :: As it happened: Wife gives more evidence in parachute trial ""I shouldn't have survived that and that was a real shock which I was finding it pretty hard to deal with."" Mrs Cilliers's husband, Emile, is accused of tampering with the parachute in the men's toilets at Netheravon Airfield, in an attempt to kill his wife so that he could run off with a woman that he met on the dating app, Tinder. The couple decided to go for a jump just five weeks after Mrs Cilliers had given birth so that she could get back into the sport. She told police that once they arrived, their daughter needed the toilet and so Mr Cilliers took her with his wife's parachute on his shoulder. Mrs Cilliers said he was in there for a long time - around five minutes or more - but has since admitted exaggerating in order to ""get her own back"" after finding out that her husband was having an affair. :: Parachute trial hears Emile Cilliers' wife Victoria was 'out for his blood' In the video, she told the police how she had hired a parachute because her own one was being serviced. Due to the weather, the couple could not jump and so decided to return the following day. She said she felt uncomfortable because her husband suggested leaving the rented parachute in their personal locker, rather than returning it to the kit store, which would have been normal practice. Mrs Cilliers explained how she became increasingly concerned that her husband was being unfaithful. She said he was very protective of his mobile phone, she found condoms in his car and a receipt for a meal for two. She told police that when she confronted him, he became angry. ""I was scared, panicky, everything seemed to be going massively pear-shaped and I didn't really understand why, I didn't understand what I had done wrong,"" she said. Mrs Cilliers said the couple had an argument about him smoking in her car and said: ""The look he gave me was incredible. He looked absolutely livid, almost blank look; I haven't seen that sort of expression before."" She added: ""I felt like I was living on a time bomb, not knowing if at any point he might turn around and say 'I'm off'."" Emile Cilliers is also accused of trying to gas his wife at the family home. He denies the charges. The case continues."

""The UK does not and will not recognise the unilateral declaration of independence made by the Catalan regional parliament,"" the statement said. ""It is based on a vote that was declared illegal by the Spanish courts. We continue to want to see the rule of law upheld, the Spanish constitution respected, and Spanish unity preserved."" Other European leaders have also had their say after Catalonia's parliament voted to declare independence. There were words of support from Scotland and Wales, with Scotland's External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop saying ""people of Catalonia must have the ability to determine their own future"". She added that the imposition of direct rule ""cannot be the solution"". Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood also insisted that Catalonia deserved autonomy, adding the Catalan people should be ""commended for continuing to reject violence even though they have faced brutality from the Spanish state"". Meanwhile, Germany threw its support behind Spain, saying it did not recognise ""such a declaration of independence"". Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Berlin supported the ""clear position"" of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in his bid to restore calm and order, adding that he hoped ""all involved will use the remaining possibilities for dialogue and de-escalation"". Emmanuel Macron also gave his full support to Spain. France's President told journalists on a visit to French Guiana: ""I have always said that I have one interlocutor in Spain, it is Prime Minister Rajoy."" He said Mr Rajoy had his ""full support"". Accompanying Mr Macron on his trip was European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who brought the topic back to the strength of the European Union. Mr Juncker said it was important to avoid ""fractures"" in the bloc, adding that he ""does not want a situation where, tomorrow, the European Union is made up of 95 different states"". ""We need to avoid splits,"" he said, because ""we already have enough splits and fractures and we do not need any more"". Earlier on Friday, European Council President Donald Tusk said that nothing had changed for the EU, adding that he hopes the Spanish government ""favours force of argument, not argument of force"". The regional parliament in Barcelona backed the independence motion by 70 to 10, with the opposition boycotting the vote."
2017-10-28,The Catalan crisis has escalated.

The Spanish Senate is authorising Article 155, allowing the use of ""all means necessary"". :: LIVE: Catalan leader faces rebellion charges The unity and future of a modern European nation is hanging in the balance. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is determined to stop Catalonia before separatists in the Basque Country and Galicia try to follow suit. Legal expert Rafael Arenas says Spain is sailing into uncharted waters. He said: ""We are in a crossroads. The crossroads is that the nationalists here in Catalonia are trying to force the independence outside the law. ""The international law and the Spanish law and the government has arrived at the point where there is only one tool to stop this situation and that is Article 155."" :: Spain crisis as Catalonia backs independence Mr Rajoy's government has the power of the state, its military and the law on his side. But he must choose carefully how to use them. He can now impose direct rule, remove Catalonia's cabinet and demand its institutions of government follow directions from Madrid. All well and good in theory. But in practice? Can the Spanish government actually enforce its will against the massive show of people power we have seen on the streets of Barcelona and elsewhere in the region? :: PM: UK 'will not recognise' Catalan independence If separatist supporters choose to defend the buildings of the Catalan government and protect their government, will Madrid force a confrontation? They've proven capable of defying central government organising a referendum where millions voted. And they are now threatening mass civil disobedience. The loyalty of Catalonia's police force could be crucial as Madrid tries to enforce its writ across Catalonia and take over its government. That can by no means be taken for granted. In the end Madrid's greatest weapon may be time. Knowing the longer this goes the more Catalonia's economy is damaged. Legal expert Eduardo Barrachina told Sky News the crisis is already hurting the region's finances. He said: ""The mere thought of independence has prompted 1,500 companies to abandon Catalonia and I'm including Catalonian companies that had been in Catalonia for centuries."" Madrid may choose to strangle the independent movement slowly. But Catalan separatists may have the resilience to see it through. The stage is set for a titanic battle of wills, the future of a nation hanging in the balance."
2017-10-28,"One politician described as ""very handsy"", another ""not safe in taxis"" and what about the unnamed parliamentarian who ""needs a new researcher - can't be a woman""?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171028043208/http://news.sky.com/story/is-westminster-harbouring-the-next-harassment-scandal-11101289,"These are apparently the experiences of female researchers and aides working in Westminster, and shared on a private Whatsapp group seen by The Sun newspaper, allegedly implicating cabinet ministers. No names have been made public - yet - but after the scandals in Hollywood and the entertainment industry, political parties will be braced for the floodgates to open. Impropriety in politics is of course nothing new, there have been numerous high-profile allegations over the years, some of which have resulted in investigations or even criminal trials. But there is heightened concern that the way Parliament and politics operates, which is far from a typical workplace, means that inappropriate behaviour can easily go unchecked. One researcher, who worked for an MP until earlier this year, told me about being verbally bullied on a number of occasions, and described the support system as an ""absolute joke"". Staff in these situations could call a dedicated helpline for harassment claims, set up in 2014, or contact the MP's political party, she said. But colleagues who had contacted the helpline did not believe any action was taken, and as for contacting the relevant person in the party: ""I don't think anyone ever did because we were all too worried that the MPs couldn't be trusted to keep things confidential. ""There is no HR when you work for an MP. Your MP is your HR system. Which means if the problem lies with them, you are absolutely stuck. ""You found out who the decent MPs were to work for and who were abusive by sounding it out with other staffers in the Sports and Social (a parliamentary bar)."" This view is echoed by MPs who have raised cases of abuse in Parliament. Senior Labour MP John Mann, who has campaigned against child abuse, told Sky News he had been contacted by victims of abuse who had received ""outrageous"" treatment. On Monday, in the House of Commons, he threatened to name an MP who had been sent home from a foreign trip, while representing Parliament, for inappropriate behaviour. :: Theresa May finds Westminster sexual harassment claims 'deeply concerning' On Friday he said: ""I know as well of two cases directly where people have felt unable to come forward, despite the fact that these cases might even have passed the criminal threshold. Certainly they're serious allegations, in one case with witnesses. ""These people ought to have the confidence to come forward because of appalling behaviour - we've seen it in Hollywood, how people have been getting away with things. ""Well I'm saying in Parliament, in the time I've been in and before, people have been getting away with similar things and that's not good enough. ""What's happened is absolutely astonishing in terms of the processes or lack of them in a workplace this would be wholly unacceptable. ""This is a workplace. It is unacceptable and it's about time we lanced this boil of sexual harassment and other bad behaviour in parliament with staff, volunteers, interns and so on. ""The cases I've seen… the way they've been dealt with and the response has been outrageous."" Theresa May's spokesman said the Prime Minister is clear that sexual harassment is ""completely unacceptable"" and should be raised with the police. But what happens when behaviour is sleazy or inappropriate, but falls short of the criminal threshold? The House of Commons authorities admit they have limited powers over ""employment matters"" such as bullying and harassment because MPs are self-employed. Conservative and Labour MPs admit that for staff - or even MPs - the prospect of raising these issues with their political parties is highly problematic. Whips offices, who keep tabs on these matters, will have a vested interest in not publicising these cases. Staff may also feel it would end their political career to raise it. Mr Mann said an independent office may need to be set up to handle complaints. One female Tory MP agreed, saying: ""There are around 7,000 people working in parliament, that's the size of a village, it is inconceivable you wouldn't have some individuals who conduct themselves improperly. ""When I have taken things to the whips office in the past, their handling of it has been disgraceful. ""If you were to go to the whips and say a member of cabinet is saying something unacceptable your chief whip cannot separate the fact they must also be protecting the Government… politics gets into all of it. ""It's not just about your reputation but the scandal that could follow. There is simply no proper mechanism to deal with complaints."" If the Westminster harassment scandal does escalate, the spotlight will fall on cases which have been allowed to fall through the cracks."
2017-10-28,The Government believes North Korea is to blame for the cyberattack that crippled NHS computer systems earlier this year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171028043208/http://news.sky.com/story/government-believe-n-korea-to-blame-for-wannacry-cyber-attack-11100260,"Security Minister Ben Wallace revealed Britain ""quite strongly"" suspects a foreign state was behind the 'WannaCry' ransomware. ""North Korea was the state that we believe was involved in this worldwide attack on our systems,"" he told the BBC. ""We can be as sure as possible - I can't obviously go into the detailed intelligence but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role."" In May, the largest ever cyberattack on the health service left hundreds of NHS computers infected, leading to thousands of appointments being cancelled and some A&E departments having to turn away ambulances. The WannaCry attack hit businesses and government services worldwide as it infected more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries in a matter of days. The cryptoworm targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system with outdated security and demanded payments worth hundreds of pounds in the Bitcoin digital currency. No part of the NHS paid the ransom demands but the Government does not know how much the disruption to services cost. ""It's a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organisations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks,"" Mr Wallace added. The minister commented after the National Audit Office (NAO) warned the Government and NHS to ""get their act together"" to prevent future attacks. An NAO report found computers at one third of health trusts across England were infected along with computers at almost 600 GP surgeries. In the wake of the report, Labour are demanding Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt attends Parliament next week to update MPs on actions to better protect NHS computer systems. The party's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth accused Mr Hunt of being ""asleep at the wheel"". ""We've really got to get a grip of this,"" he told Sky News. ""In the words of the independent report, the NHS has got to get its act together. ""So I hope we can have some urgent clarification and reassurance from the Government over what they are doing."" The Department of Health have pointed to new cybersecurity inspections, enhanced guidance for NHS trusts and £21m in funding to improve resilience in trauma centres as measures they have taken since May."

Instead, the 34-year-old was officiating at the Champions League clash between Barcelona and Olympiacos in the Nou Camp stadium. Following the row, Mr Ross has decided to no longer accept refereeing jobs while the House of Commons is sitting, pledging to put his ""sole focus"" on his constituency. It means he will no longer be able to work as one of Scotland's representatives at next summer's World Cup in Russia. Explaining why he is hanging up his whistle and linesman's flag in a statement to local newspapers, Mr Ross said: ""This week I have taken the decision to inform the football authorities that I will no longer be able to accept any appointments when Parliament is sitting. ""The consequence of this decision means that I can no longer do the majority of international matches and my hopes of representing Scotland, and most importantly for me, Moray, at a World Cup, now end. ""But as MP for Moray I gave a commitment to the people who elected me that I would always act in their best interests which is why I have taken this decision."" However, the former member of the Scottish Parliament defended missing this month's opposition day debate on the Government's flagship benefits reforms. Mr Ross, who has been a referee for almost 15 years, said he had been ""paired"" with an opposition member who would also skip the subsequent vote. In the event, all Tory MPs were controversially ordered to abstain on a non-binding Labour motion. Claiming he would also have been unable to speak in the debate due to the number of other Scottish Tories who had already requested to contribute, Mr Ross highlighted how he was able to take part in another debate on Universal Credit a week later. The latest register of MPs' interests reveals Mr Ross has earned more than £4,300 for officiating duties since becoming an MP, including £1,436.35 for serving as an assistant referee at the Europa League match between Slovenian side NK Domzale and French club Olympique de Marseille."

2017-10-28,The Spanish Prime Minister has dissolved Catalonia's parliament and called an election after the region finally declared independence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171028043208/http://news.sky.com/story/spains-pm-calls-december-election-in-catalonia-11101220,"Mariano Rajoy invoked the emergency measures in response to Catalan MPs voting to break away from the Spanish state. He said he would seek to declare the vote illegal. Mr Rajoy said Catalonia's police chief would be sacked and central government departments would take over functions from the regional parliament. :: What next for Spain? The Spanish government is shutting down Catalonia's foreign affairs department and dismissing its delegates in Brussels and Madrid. Regional elections will be held on 21 December. Mr Rajoy said it was important to call fresh elections to ensure ""nobody can act outside the law"", but added ""we never wanted to come to this point"". He said the aim was to return Catalonia to ""normality and legality"" as soon as possible. :: Catalonia crisis hots up as both sides take the nuclear option Spain arrived at the constitutional crisis after officials in the northeatern region held an illegal independence referendum on 1 October. The vote was marred by violence as national police intervened, but Catalan leaders said more than two million people turned out and that 92% wanted to break from Spain. After independence was declared on Friday, thousands turned out to celebrate outside the Catalan government palace. They watched events inside from two giant screens as they clapped and shouted ""independence"" in Catalan. The motion, which was boycotted by opposition parties, said Catalonia was an independent, sovereign and social democratic state, and called on other countries and institutions to recognise it. However, after the announcement from the Catalan parliament, Mr Rajoy hinted that their celebrations would be short-lived by saying they had done ""something that is not possible - declare independence"". The supporters who had gathered in Sant Jaume Square in Barcelona to hear the Catalan declaration were told of Mr Rajoy's decision to sack the region's parliament. A band took to the stage and the crowd defiantly began singing and dancing to music, shouting: ""We are not moving."" Meanwhile, hundreds of anti-separatist protesters took to the streets waving Spanish flags to demonstrate against the independence declaration. Miquel Iceta, the leader of Catalonia's Socialists, welcomed Mr Rajoy's announcement of a new election. In a tweet, he said: ""In the most sad day due to a wrong and irresponsible decision by the separatists, we see a ray of light."" The UK, Germany and France are among European powers to throw their weight behind Spain's prime minister. ""It is based on a vote that was declared illegal by the Spanish courts,"" said Downing Street. ""We continue to want to see the rule of law upheld, the Spanish constitution respected, and Spanish unity preserved."" Catalonia has its own distinct culture and language that was suppressed under the Franco regime, and independence supporters say the wealthy region contributes far more to Spain's economy than it gets back. If the Spanish government does not act robustly against Catalonia's independence bid some fear other regions, such as the Basque country and Galicia, could also launch a renewed push to break away."

He told jurors: ""I have never been so scared when I found out. I can't tell you how I felt. I can't tell you how upset I was that people got hurt that night."" Jurors have been told that he threw the liquid after an argument with two men in the Dalston nightclub, Mangle E8. Collins said he threw the liquid from the bottle twice because he wanted to ensure that girls he knew could not have their drinks spiked. ""I was making sure they weren't going to use this date rape drug on girls and I did throw it, and did throw it a second time to make sure they knew it was all gone,"" he said. :: Towie star's ex sprayed acid 'to stop men spiking drinks', court hears Collins also said that if he knew it was acid then ""there's no way"" he would have thrown it as it would have injured a friend. He said he stayed away from family and friends because he feared the gang members who he took the date rape drug from would want revenge. The court heard that Collins bought a second pay as you go mobile to keep in touch with The Only Way Is Essex star, Ferne McCann, and to stop police tracing his original iPhone. He said: ""My girlfriend was pregnant at the time so I did want to stay in contact with her and my family.""

Mr Phoenix, of Tottenham, north London, denies four counts of GBH and two counts of ABH. The trial continues."
2017-10-28,The former head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has accused British politicians of misleading the public over the realities of Brexit and insists there will have to be a border in Ireland.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171028043208/http://news.sky.com/story/ex-wto-boss-pascal-lamy-there-will-have-to-be-an-irish-border-post-brexit-11101026,"Pascal Lamy who was head of the WTO between 2005-2013, told Sky News that while things had improved since the referendum, UK politicians ""still a long way to go"" in being honest with voters. Asked if the Prime Minister and others were misleading the public, Mr Lamy said. ""Yes. I believe that was true during the campaign and is still true today. ""Although a bit less true. There has been some crab walking, talking having to pay a bill, there might be a transition two year period which are signs of moves, in direction of reality but in my view still a long way to go."" ""I am not saying that this [Brexit] is hell, I'm saying it is less good than heaven and there is a long distance between less good than heaven and hell. ""It will have a cost which needs to be recognised properly before we try and reduce it."" Mr Lamy, speaking in Dublin, dismissed suggestions that there could be a no-border in Ireland. The former EU Commissioner said ""No, this vocabulary of creative, flexible, seamless, cost less, infrastructureless border is much about poetry. ""It's a way to call something because you don't want to call it reality. With my trade experience, I can see, no, no-cost border. ""There will have to be a border, i.e. a cost, whatever shape it takes there will be a cost."" Many Brexit supporters have suggested Britain could easily trade under WTO rules with little impact, however Mr. Lamy suggested there would be an economic impact. :: Micheal Martin: Brexit makes hard Irish border 'inevitable' ""It's clearly a suboptimal outcome, the best outcome is certainly a deal which will allow both UK and Europe to adjust to the new situation. ""Let's look at trade, it would mean 10% tariff on cars, whatever tariffs on sugar, cheese, spirits, which would be clearly worse situation that clearly have a trade agreement."" Speaking to Sky News at the Institute for International and European Affairs, the self-described European integrationist said he believed Brexit was a process and not a negotiation. ""I've been in negotiations for a long time in my professional life. A negotiation is something where you trade off something - I'll give you something you give me something, I'll give you more of this if you give me more of that. This is not what Brexit is about. ""Brexit is getting the UK egg out of the EU basket. This is not a negotiation but a process which needs to be handled in such a way that its inevitable cost is as muted as possible. ""I don't see what the UK could give to the EU which would smooth the process that the EU could gain."""
2017-10-28,The killing of US President John F Kennedy still fascinates the public 54 years on.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171028043208/http://news.sky.com/story/jfk-files-10-things-the-previously-classified-papers-reveal-11100364,"The official Warren Commission report, which declared former marine Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, continues to face heavy scepticism from conspiracy theorists. :: Trump delays releasing 'sensitive' JFK files We take a look at the 2,891 never-seen-before secret files about the assassination to see whether they settle the matter once and for all. :: British paper was 'tipped off' about assassination A British newspaper received an anonymous call about ""some big news"" in America - 25 minutes before President John F Kennedy was assassinated, documents have shown. A memo to the FBI reads: ""The caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up."" After news of the president's death came through, details of the call were passed on to the police and MI5. The reporter was not named but was described as ""a sound and loyal person with no security record"". :: Soviets feared blame over assassination Documents from then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover reveal that the Soviet Union feared it would be blamed for putting Lee Harvey Oswald up to assassinating Mr Kennedy - which could have lead to nuclear war. ""As a result of these feelings, the Soviet Union immediately went into a state of national alert,"" he said. ""Our source further stated that Soviet officials were fearful that without leadership, some irresponsible general in the United States might launch a missile at the Soviet Union."" :: FBI knew about threat to kill Oswald A threat had been made to kill Oswald the night before he was shot by nightclub owner Jack Ruby. A memo dictated by Mr Hoover on 24 November 1963, hours after the shooting, started: ""There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead."" He said after Oswald's arrest that he ""received a call in our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organised to kill Oswald"". The police had assured him Oswald would be protected but this ""was not done"". Oswald was murdered as he was being transferred from the city jail, two days after Mr Kennedy's death. The memo added: ""We had an agent at the hospital in the hope that he might make some kind of a confession before he died but he did not do so."" :: 'Hairbrained' CIA plots to kill Fidel Castro There are also notes and reports that reveal the Kennedy administration's covert efforts to kill Fidel Castro and overthrow his government in Cuba. A document details elaborate plots including a plan to get poison pills ""into the hands of someone who could place them in a beverage to be drunk by Premier Castro"" and how the CIA hired an intermediary to approach Mafia boss Sam Giancana to offer him ""$150,000 to hire some gunman to go into Cuba and kill Castro"". It also discusses Castro's known love of diving and what are described as ""hairbrained"" schemes to eliminate the leader, including an exploding seashell and by giving him a contaminated diving suit. ""The CIA plan was to dust the inside of the suit with a fungus producing medera foot, a disabling and chronic skin disease, and also contaminating the suit with tuberculosis bacilli in the breathing apparatus,"" it read. ""During this period of time there were also discussions about preparing a booby-trap spectacular seashell"" which ""would be loaded with explosives to blow apart when the shell was lifted"". :: Threats to John F Kennedy A 400-page document appears to describe people being monitored as potential threats to Kennedy and his successor, Lyndon Johnson. One suspect is described as a ""subject"" who ""participated in pickets against JFK in 1961"". ""Allegedly trained in guerilla tactics & sabotage,"" it read. ""Considered very dangerous by those who know him. Has visited USA & Cuba. Considered armed and dangerous."" It reveals one person sent a letter to Mr Johnson in December 1963 stating ""you're doomed"". It continued: ""Interviewed 1/23/64; friendly. Said letter was a joke. Not dangerous. Attending 5th grade."" :: Oswald met with KGB agent A file reveals Oswald met with a KGB sabotage and assassination officer less than two months before Mr Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas on 22 November 1963, and that CIA agents speculated he might be a KGB agent. A document, dated the day after the killing, reveals the CIA intercepted a call Oswald made to a KGB officer - Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov - at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City which he visited on 28 September the same year. ""This was learned when OSWALD called the Soviet Embassy on 1 October, identifying himself by name and speaking broken Russian, stating the above and asking the guard who answered the phone whether there was 'anything new concerning the telegram to Washington'. ""The Guard checked and then told OSWALD that a request had been sent, but nothing had as yet been received,"" it read. It added: ""We have top secret Soviet intelligence documents, describing military intelligence doctrine, which show that very important agents can be met in official installations using cover for their presence [as if] there [for] some sort of open business."" :: Soviet view of JFK assassination The Soviets described Lee Harvey Oswald as a ""neurotic maniac"" and believed Mr Kennedy's assassination was organised by the US right wing. ""They seemed convinced that the assassination was not the deed of one man, but that it arose out of a carefully planned campaign in which several people played a part,"" said Mr Hoover in a memo to the White House on 1 December 1966. He added: ""According to our source, Soviet officials claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald had no connection whatsoever with the Soviet Union. They described him as a neurotic maniac who was disloyal to his own country and everything else."" :: Soviets claimed they had 'data' Johnson was behind assassination The KGB thought then-vice president and Mr Kennedy's successor Lyndon Johnson could have been behind the assassination. In the same December 1966 memo, Mr Hoover notes sources said ""the KGB was in possession of data purporting to indicate President Johnson was responsible for the assassination of the late President John F Kennedy"". He also revealed that ""it was of extreme importance to the Soviet government to determine precisely what kind of a man the new President Lyndon Johnson would be"", adding he was ""practically unknown to the Soviet government and, accordingly, the KGB had issued instructions to all of its agents to immediately obtain all data available concerning the incumbent President"". :: Oswald's bus trip to Mexico An April 1964 FBI document recounts Lee Harvey Oswald's bus trip to Mexico in October 1963, just weeks before the assassination. It includes the names of the people sitting around him and details he was wearing ""a short-sleeved light coloured sport shirt and no coat"". :: Hoover feared spread of JFK conspiracy theories Mr Hoover vented his frustration over Oswald's death in a memo. He said he and then-deputy attorney general Nicholas Katzenbach feared the spread of conspiracy theories following Mr Kennedy's assassination, given that the FBI never got a confession to the shooting from the former US marine. He wrote: ""The thing that I am concerned about, and so is Mr Katzenbach, is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin."""
2017-10-28,"This Halloween, Netflix released two of its best shows and finally broke the curse of its terribly flawed original films.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171028043208/http://news.sky.com/story/on-halloween-netflix-finally-got-it-right-11100647,"Netflix is a bit like Pinocchio. It so wants to be a real boy, that it risks turning into a donkey. In its latest efforts to compete with classic Hollywood studios, the biggest video streaming service in the world has done deals with some of the biggest actors and directors working in the industry. Okja, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton, brought Netflix to the Cannes International Film Festival this year and secured a nomination for the prestigious Palme d'Or. Meanwhile, Netflix managed to attract names like Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jerry Seinfeld and even Martin Scorsese. The dream of becoming a proper film studio was beginning to look pretty real. But, in film, being big and being great is seldom the same thing. Last year it was A24, a small indie distributor, which nailed the best picture Oscar with Moonlight. This year, the same A24 has secured some of the best films in the run, leaving the expensive box office flops for giants like Warner Brothers or Paramount. Sadly, it looked as if Netflix might be going down the same unfortunate road. Being a novice in film production, the streaming giant seemed to always over-stretch the length of its original films, leaving a sometimes botchy final edit to premiere on our screens. Okja is a weird film, which sometimes promises greatness but ultimately loses itself in unnecessary plot points and boring scenes. The same can be said of Brad Pitt's nearly-funny War Machine or every Adam Sandler film Netflix has ever produced. The same happens with its original shows. What was once a game-changing Daredevil is now a boring and mainstream group of superheroes. What started off as a brilliant political satire, is now a crumbling House Of Cards. Netflix, I thought, had lost its appeal. Apart from Aziz Ansari's refreshing Master Of None, there was nothing really worth ""binge watching"" - an expression Netflix proudly coined as its own. That is, until this Halloween. Earlier this month, Netflix re-teamed with David Fincher to create a bold, slow-burning crime show which has briefly taken us back to age of quality drama, where the viewer didn't need to be surprised every episode, where each season finale didn't automatically become a trending hashtag on Twitter. Mindhunter, about the dawn of criminal psychology at the FBI, is a cerebral show which nabs its viewers without having to resource to extreme violence or over-explicit sex scenes. With it, Netflix has proven it is not just about leftover superheroes and true-crime TV shows. It proved it still has the grit of the small company who started off delivering DVDs by mail. Adding to that, it also decided to capitalise on one of its biggest successes, Stranger Things. The retro-est sci-fi show ever made premiered its second season on Friday, just in time for Halloween, and has already proved it was worth the wait. The small town of Hawking, Indiana has become one of the biggest phenomena in pop culture today. And not because of its huge budget or A-list celebrities - it even recycled a few of them from the 1980s - but because it was an auteur show at heart. Even with its movies, Netflix seems to have broken the curse of the over-convoluted, poorly edited drama. With Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories (New And Selected), Netflix stepped up its game and might even, likely, definitely, maybe go to the Oscars. Adam Sandler has reminded everyone that he is a fantastic actor, and it's time for Dustin Hoffman to get back on stage at the Academy. If it does get nominated, it will be the first time the streaming service will set foot at the Dolby Theatre with a feature drama. And, perhaps most importantly, with one which deserves the recognition. Maybe that way Netflix will learn that, to be a real boy, it doesn't need to do what the other boys do. It just needs to be brave, and good, and success will follow."
