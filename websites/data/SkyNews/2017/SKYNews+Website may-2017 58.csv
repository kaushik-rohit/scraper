2017-05-20,"US airstrikes targeting pro-Assad forces close to the Iraqi border have been branded ""illegitimate"" by Russia.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/us-airstrikes-in-syria-completely-unacceptable-russia-says-10884020,"Coalition warplanes targeted a convoy of Syrian government forces and Iranian-backed militia close to the Iraq border on Thursday. The action was to protect British and American special forces based in al Tanf, southeast Syria. ""It is illegitimate, unlawful and yet another gross violation of Syria's sovereignty,"" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said in televised comments while on a trip to Cyprus. He also said Moscow was ""concerned"" that the ""emerging understanding"" of the need to unite efforts against Islamic State and the former Nusra front was ""starting to erode"". Russia is a key ally of Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad's regime, which called the US-led action a ""brazen attack"" and insisted it would ""not be intimidated"" by the assault. The Syrian regime claimed the bombardment killed a number of people and said it revealed the ""falseness"" of the coalition's claim to be solely fighting IS in the war-torn country. ""The Syrian Arab Army is fighting terrorism on its territory, and no party has the right to determine the course of its operations,"" a source told AFP. It was the first close confrontation between the US military and forces supporting Mr Assad. US defence secretary General James Mattis denied the destruction of the convoy, which included a number of tanks, marked an escalation of America's intervention in Syria. He said: ""We are not increasing our role in the Syrian civil war. But we will defend our troops."" In a statement on Twitter, Operation Inherent Resolve said the Russians attempted to get the convoy to turn back. ""Coalition struck Syrian pro-regime forces advancing in a de-confliction zone near al Tanf posing a threat to US partner forces,"" it said. ""This was despite Russian attempts to dissuade pro-regime movement towards al Tanf, coalition aircraft show of force and warning shots."" US and UK special forces have been training Syrian rebels at a heavily fortified base in al Tanf. A 34-mile defensive zone exists around the base, and it is believed these forces strayed inside that. ""They were potentially probing to see how close they could get to al Tanf,"" an anonymous US official said. The convoy was believed to have been about 17 miles away from the base when it was hit. The claim that Russia was warned and was still unable to stop the convoy will call into question how much influence their commanders have over Assad and Iranian forces in parts of Syria."
2017-05-20,Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has told Sky News that stop and search operations could be stepped up in problem areas of the capital after a huge rise in knife crime.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/police-stop-and-search-in-london-could-be-stepped-up-as-knife-crime-rises-10883998,"Thirty people have been stabbed to death in London so far in 2017, a rise of almost a third from 23 during the same period in 2016. In the last four weeks alone, there have been 14 deaths. A record 300 knives were seized in seven days by officers across the capital. Scotland Yard has set up a specialist task force to combat the problem, with community leaders claiming some children as young as six are carrying knives. On a week in which there were three knife killings, Sky News gained exclusive access to the Met's elite gang units, tasked with getting knives and other dangerous weapons off the streets. Plain-clothed officers in south and west London targeted known gang members and made several knife-related arrests. Ms Dick said one of her biggest challenges as the UK's most senior officer was tackling knife crime, and indicated the likelihood that stop and search might have to be increased in the worst areas. She told Sky News: ""Stop and search is a very important tactic - it's a very important power for officers and has been hugely powerful in the fight so far against knife crime. ""Thousands and thousands of people have been stopped and successfully searched, where a knife has been recovered. ""So of course I want it to continue and if it increases, because that is the best way that people are finding to reduce knife crime, and to stop young people suffering life-changing injuries, or even being killed, then I will absolutely support it and explain why we've had an increase."" The Commissioner vowed to get to the root of knife crime as she visited a youth centre, where she met the family of 20-year-old Lewis Elwin, who was stabbed to death in Tooting, south London, in 2016. His killer has not been caught. His eldest brother, Byron Douglas-Letts, said: ""It's frightening knowing someone can commit such an offence, such an act of violence, but yet no one has been caught, and this is just one case - these cases are popping up everywhere now."" Byron and his twin brother Aaron are now actively involved in community outreach work, helping mentor youngsters and showing them positive alternatives to crime. The Metropolitan police in particular is more than aware of the sensitivities surrounding the use of stop and search. The force has been criticised in the past for an overzealous approach in the use of the tactic, with claims minority communities are often unfairly targeted. A police officer has powers to stop and search someone if they have 'reasonable grounds' to suspect they are carrying weapons, illegal drugs or stolen property. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary says black people are four times more likely to face a stop and search. Temi Mwale, who runs the 4Front community project to steer youths away from gangs, said: ""Stop and search has been an issue for the black community for decades. A police officer may say that they're not intentionally stopping young black people, but this is the context and history we have got. ""While officers may not be trying to single out young black people, the reality is that, as an institution, the Metropolitan Police does single out young black people and that is a problem."" But Scotland Yard commanders say the wider public perception around the use of stop and search is changing, partly due to a more targeted use of the tactic, but also because of real community concerns about the level of knife crime and gang violence."
2017-05-20,"Julian Assange has said Sweden's decision to drop an investigation into allegations of rape against him is an ""important victory"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/julian-assange-i-cannot-forgive-terrible-injustice-10884606,"But on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where the WikiLeaks founder has been holed up since June 2012, he said cannot forgive or forget the ""terrible injustice"" he has suffered. He told reporters and supporters in central London that his children had grown up without him during the total of seven years he has spent in detention without charge. Assange criticised the EU during his speech, and said: ""The reality is detention and extradition without charge has become a feature of the European Union."" Although he is no longer facing action from Swedish prosecutors, Assange is still at risk of arrest if he tries to leave the Ecuadorian embassy. He is wanted by British police for breaching bail conditions - and WikiLeaks is concerned this could result in him being extradited to the US, where he would face prosecution for publishing swathes of classified military and diplomatic documents. Assange has said the UK is refusing to confirm or deny whether America has made an extradition request - and he insisted he is happy to engage with the US Justice Department. :: Years inside: Timeline of Assange's fight for freedom The 45-year-old, who is originally from Australia, told his supporters that the road is far from over - and ""the proper war is just commencing"". Prior to his speech, Ecuador's foreign minister Guillaume Long had said: ""Given that the European Arrest Warrant no longer holds, Ecuador will now be intensifying its diplomatic efforts with the UK so that Julian Assange can gain safe passage in order to enjoy his asylum in Ecuador."" Assange has now been inside the embassy for four years and 334 days. From outside the embassy, Sky's Ashish Joshi said: ""Assange sounded angry, he sounded triumphant and he sounded defiant. ""When he was speaking he talked about another major victory: Chelsea Manning being released from jail 28 years early because her sentence had been commuted. ""The important distinction is that her sentence was commuted by then president Barack Obama. Is Donald Trump likely to take a lenient approach to Julian Assange? The answer is no."" pic.twitter.com/dDvB1Vekhg Assange had always denied the rape allegation against him, and his accuser said in a statement that she was ""shocked"" the investigation had ended - describing it as a ""scandal"". Although the investigation has been dropped, Assange has not been exonerated - and Sweden could reopen the case if he returns to Sweden before the statute of limitations lapses in 2020."

Last year, he said he was a ""big-time"" supporter and that Mr Corbyn and Bernie Sanders were ""the only shining lights we have right now"". This time, he got a response from Mr Corbyn, who tweeted to say that ""if Danny DeVito is saying you should register to vote then you really should"".

Alyssa Elsman, an 18-year-old from Portage, Michigan, was killed when a vehicle hit nearly two dozen people in the tourist area before becoming wedged against steel barriers. The car is said to have performed a u-turn and driven at speed against the flow of traffic for three blocks. Ms Elsman's 13-year-old sister is among the 22 people injured, four of them critically. Rojas, said to have been discharged from the US Navy following disciplinary problems, is expected to appear in court on Friday. He has a history of drink-driving charges but is believed to have initially tested negative for alcohol on Thursday. Police are waiting on the results of drugs tests. New York Police Department assistant chief William Aubry said the incident started at 11.54am local time on Thursday, when a Honda Accord was seen travelling southbound on 7th Avenue in the direction of 42nd Street. Witnesses described seeing people being loaded on to stretchers, shoes scattered around the scene and people in bloodstained blankets amid the carnage. A picture of the suspect on the TMZ website shows him with a ripped t-shirt after being subdued and surrounded by police officers. Ken Bradix, a security worker at the Planet Hollywood restaurant, said: ""He began screaming, no particular words but just utter screaming. ""He was swinging his arms at the same time."" The incident raised initial terror fears following the use of vehicles in attacks in Nice, France, and Berlin, Germany, last year. But New York mayor Bill de Blasio said there was ""no indication that this was an act of terrorism"". Harrison Ramos, a neighbour of Rojas in the Bronx, said he had been ""going through a real tough time"". A week ago Rojas pleaded guilty to a harassment violation after being arrested for pointing a knife at someone he accused of stealing his identity."

He was 79. Along with Myra Hindley, who died in 2002, he killed five children between 1963 and 1965, abducting them before sexually assaulting and murdering them. On Thursday, Brady's body was released to his lawyer and it had been reported that he wished to have his remains burnt and ashes scattered in the city where he grew up. Glasgow City Council said it would not allow him to be cremated in the area. A spokesman said: ""We have not had such a request but we would refuse that request. ""We would advise the private crematoria not to accept the request or any such request, should it be forthcoming."" Brady and Hindley's victims - Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans - were aged between 10 and 17. :: The Moors murders - the victims of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley The couple were jailed for life for three of the killings before later admitting the murders of Pauline and Keith. Fifty years on, the remains of 12-year-old Keith have never been found - despite the belief that Brady knew the location and buried him on the Moors, where he buried three others. At an inquest on Tuesday, Senior Coroner for Sefton, Christopher Sumner, had delayed the release of the body to ask for assurances that a funeral director and crematorium willing to take it had been found. He also wanted a guarantee that Brady's ashes would not be scattered on Saddleworth Moor. At a reconvened hearing on Wednesday, Brady's solicitor, Robin Makin, said there was ""no likelihood"" the ashes would be brought there. Mr Sumner delayed the body's release further to allow Merseyside Police to negotiate with Mr Makin about arrangements for the funeral. The full inquest into Brady's death will take place on 29 June."

2017-05-20,Plain packaging will be standard for all cigarette packets sold in the UK from this weekend.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/cigarette-packaging-gets-a-make-under-as-plain-boxes-become-standard-10885033,"Smokers will also have to cough up extra cash to pay for their tobacco, with packs of 10 cigarettes banned and the cheapest pack costing £8.82 after the move. The new rules - called the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD2) - will apply to all EU countries selling tobacco products. New standardised green packaging will carry large graphic warnings of the dangers of smoking, designed to deter young people from taking up the habit. All packs must contain a minimum of 20 cigarettes to allow enough box space for the newly enlarged warnings, and hand-rolled tobacco pouches must also contain a minimum of 30g of tobacco. Menthol cigarettes will be completely banned by 2020. The TPD2 mandate will also introduce EU-wide tracking and tracing of tobacco products from 2019 and new controls on e-cigarettes. The EU Commission hopes that the new measures will create a 2% drop in cigarette consumption over the next five years. However, the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association (TMA) says they believe the new restrictions will boost the black market in tobacco, as smokers seek out cheaper alternatives elsewhere. Insisting there was ""no evidence"" that youth-uptake would be reduced, the TMA cited French cigarette sales figures from March, which were 4% higher than the same period last year. France adopted plain cigarette packaging in January this year. While the law to standardise packaging was brought in last May, shops were given a year to sell off old stock and get ready for the changes. A series of court cases testing the legality of the regulations had initially delayed the implementation of the directive. Chancellor Philip Hammond introduced the new minimum excise tax duty on cigarettes in the UK in his March Budget, adding an average of 35p to a pack of 20 cigarettes."
2017-05-20,For nearly 70 years Orkney and Shetland has been a Liberal stronghold.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/shetland-isles-brimming-with-floating-voters-10884934,"Westminster's most remote constituency was the domain of Jo Grimond, the leader of the party for a decade. Alistair Carmichael has served the constituency for the past 16 years. But the safe seat has become a marginal, with the Scottish National Party surge of 2015 taking them within 817 votes of gaining all 11 Liberal Democrat seats in Scotland. And the only survivor of the rout has a problem as he seeks re-election. Mr Carmichael was Secretary of State for Scotland in the coalition government. During the 2015 campaign he tried to discredit the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon with a leaked memo suggesting she secretly wanted David Cameron to win the election. He then lied to cover up his role. When the truth emerged, four of his constituents mounted a legal challenge to force him to stand down as their MP. They raised more than £200,000 to bring the case to court. Mr Carmichael survived, but two judges agreed he had told a ""blatant lie"", and ordered him to pay his own legal costs. The damage to his reputation could be an election issue. He told Sky News: ""To be in politics is to be judged. I've always accepted that. ""I think people here are fair-minded people who will judge me not just on that one incident, but on my record of getting things done and helping people here in the isles for 16 years. ""I regret any damage I did to politics and my party. It's taught me that I'm never getting myself into that situation again."" Two of those who brought the case told Sky News that in an island community, personal integrity is even more important. Fiona Grahame said: ""It was a smear, and then he lied to cover up the smear that he had perpetuated. We're all quite close to one another. We meet each other in the street. I live quite near Alistair. So for him to do this and be so dishonest was really quite appalling."" Her colleague Tim added: ""You have no right whatsoever to complain about politicians being dishonest if you're not prepared to hold them accountable at the absolute point where you're able to do so."" Mr Carmichael believed the legal case was an attempt by nationalist supporters to oust an elected MP, and Mr Morrison admits being a member of the SNP. The party's candidate in this election is 26-year-old Miriam Brett, who grew up on the Shetland island of Bressay, and who has worked as an SNP economic adviser. She demonstrated her local credentials by playing fiddle in a traditional music session in a Lerwick pub, but one of the reasons the SNP failed to win the seat last time was because Orkney and Shetland are among the most pro-union parts of Scotland. Ms Brett told Sky News: ""What this campaign is about for us, is creating a strong, principled and consistent opposition to an increasingly reckless agenda at UK government level and I think the SNP's record on that is incredibly strong."" With Labour, Conservative and UKIP candidates trailing well behind in the 2015 election, Adam Civico, the editor of the Shetland Times, thinks pro-Union voters may get behind the Liberal Democrat candidate. He said: ""From speaking to people you get the impression that yes there is going to be tactical voting. I think there's a good number of people around who will perhaps support Alistair Carmichael simply because they don't want the SNP to win."" There is also an independent candidate, who is in favour of independence - for Shetland. Some islanders would like to see greater autonomy such as that enjoyed by their neighbours in the Faroe Islands. Shetland is closer to the Faroes and to Norway than it is to Edinburgh. :: Also standing for election in the Orkney and Shetland constituency are: Jamie Halcro Johnston for the Conservatives; Robina Rendall Barton for Labour; Robert Smith for the UK Independence Party; and independent candidate Robert Smith. :: Sky is hosting the first live studio audience Q&A of the election with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn - find out how you can be involved. :: And don't forget to watch it on Sky News: The Battle For Number 10 on Bank Holiday Monday, 29 May, at 8.30pm."
2017-05-20,Disgraced former US congressman Anthony Weiner has cried in court as he pleaded guilty to sexting a 15-year-old girl.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/disgraced-former-us-congressman-anthony-weiner-to-admit-sexting-15-year-old-10884438,"The ex-Democrat politician broke down in tears as he apologised to his victim, saying: ""I have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse."" Weiner, 52, pleaded guilty in a federal court in New York to one count of sending obscene messages to a minor over his online communications with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The judge in Manhattan told him he would have to register as a sex offender. He could face years in jail, but as part of a plea deal with prosecutors, he will not appeal any sentence of between 21 and 27 months. In September, his victim told a news website she had exchanged lewd messages with him for several months and also accused him of asking her to undress on camera. The investigation that followed had far-reaching political consequences. FBI agents seized his laptop computer, finding a new cache of emails that then-Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had sent to senior aide, Huma Abedin, Mr Weiner's wife. In October, just days before the election, FBI director James Comey announced the bureau was reopening its closed inquiry into whether ex-Secretary of State Clinton had used a private email server for classified documents in order to assess the newly-discovered correspondence. Though Mr Comey said soon afterwards that the emails contained nothing to change his view that Mrs Clinton could not be charged with a crime, the development was seen as influencing voters in the run-up to polling on 8 November. Mrs Clinton partly blamed her election loss to Republican Donald Trump on Mr Comey's announcement. Last year's case is not the first time Weiner, who has denied accusations he is a 'sext-a-holic', has been exposed. In May 2011, he accidentally tweeted out a photo of his genitalia in boxer shorts that he apparently meant to send privately to a college student. He initially denied sending it, but resigned from Congress two weeks later as more women with lewd photos came forward. Two years later, determined to revive his political career, he ran for mayor of New York, but further sexts and photos were published, posted under the alias ""Carlos Danger"". Mr Weiner refused to quit the race, but finished in fifth place with 4.9% of the vote."

The inquest heard evidence that she may not have realised how quickly she could become unconscious. Ms Thompson, who had a history of addiction and mental health issues, had lived as a woman since her school days but had not taken steps to have her gender recognised in law. The three week inquest heard conflicting evidence about her willingness to be sent to a male prison following a breach of conditions imposed for a shoplifting offence. In a written narrative conclusion, the jury, which had been instructed to answer specific questions by Wakefield Coroner Jonathan Leach, said Leeds Prison ""was the right one for Vikki."" But they were sharply critical of the management of her care as a transgender woman at the Leeds jail, saying she had been let down ""throughout her chaotic life"" by the NHS, the Prison Service, and her family. In a statement, her family's lawyer, Philip Goldberg, said she was one of three transgender women to die within a male prison estate in the past 18 months. ""Vikki's mother remains deeply distressed by the loss of her daughter. Yet hopes that if any good is to come of her death, it's that the Ministry of Justice also undertakes a complete overhaul of HMP Leeds,"" he said."
2017-05-20,"Labour has accused Theresa May of launching an ""all out attack"" on pensioners - and called on her to ditch plans to means test the Winter Fuel Allowance.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/general-election-labour-hits-out-at-tory-attack-on-pensioners-10884103,"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey went on the offensive as they unveiled a new attack poster warning voters about a ""Tory triple whammy for pensioners"". The party says plans to scrap the triple lock on pensions, end universal winter fuel payments and overhaul the social care system are an assault on the living standards of the over-65s. The Conservatives say people of all ages will suffer if Labour are in charge of the economy and Brexit after the General Election on 8 June. Labour's salvo on pensioners comes after Mrs May unveiled her election manifesto on Thursday. On the triple lock, Labour says that if its replacement, the less generous double lock, had been in place since 2010 pensioners would now be £330 worse off. Ms Long-Bailey said that in 2015, growth had been so weak the basic state pension would have been uprated by just £1.36 under the double lock formula. She said proposals set out in the Tory manifesto for the pension age to reflect life expectancy mean that 34 million people will have to work longer if Mrs May stays in Downing Street. ""They have laid bare the threat they pose to pensioner security and living standards and shown beyond a doubt that they are turning their backs on older people and future generations of pensioners,"" she said. ""Those people who worked hard, they did everything that was asked of them, they put their blood, sweat and tears into making Britain great. ""Today they must feel like they have been kicked in the teeth."" Under the triple lock, pensions are uprated by the rate of earnings, prices or 2.5%, whichever is higher. Under the double lock, the 2.5% minimum guarantee is binned. ""That's not good enough to guarantee the real value of pensioners' incomes and frankly older people, who have worked hard all their lives, deserve a lot better than this. They deserve respect,"" Ms Long-Bailey said. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the ""attack"" on pensioners comes at a time when living standards are already being squeezed. He said the average household is paying nearly £2,000 more in direct and indirect taxation than in 2010. Under current Conservative proposals, he said there were net tax rises of £14.4bn - the equivalent of £760 per family - on the horizon between now and 2021/2022. ""Under the Tories, the UK has experienced the worst decade in real household disposable income since 1949. This has a material impact on household finances,"" he said. ""The average household is £1,000 worse-off this year alone as a result of the Tories' abysmal record on living standards relative to what households could have expected under Labour."" Mr McDonnell challenged the Conservatives on winter fuel payments, saying: ""This is a savage attack on vulnerable pensioners, particularly those who are just about managing. ""It is disgraceful and we are calling on the Conservative Party to withdraw it today."" In response to a question from Sky's Tamara Cohen, Mr McDonnell dismissed concern over the fact that the universal nature of the benefit means wealthy pensioners - such as Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger, for example - can get cash for their heating. Mr McDonnell, who is 65, also admitted claiming his Winter Fuel Allowance, but defended its universality. He said: ""With regard to the Winter Fuel Allowance, I spend it on winter fuel. ""But the issue there overall is that I'm on an MP's salary and I get taxed, as a result of that it will contribute to the overall exchequer and that's the fairest way of doing it. ""I do not want means testing introduced on winter fuel because we know ... at least a third do not claim pensioner credit because it's means tested. ""I think it's a more efficient way of getting the money to where it is really needed."" A Conservative spokesman said: ""Our long-term plan for elderly care will make the system fairer, better funded and more sustainable - helping to ensure elderly people receive the dignified and high quality care they deserve. ""Jeremy Corbyn can't deliver anything and isn't being honest with people. ""His numbers don't add up and the only way to pay for his ideas is massive tax hikes on working people."" :: Sky is hosting the first live studio audience Q&A of the election with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn - find out how you can be involved. :: And don't forget to watch it on Sky News: The Battle For Number 10 on Bank Holiday Monday, 29 May, at 8.30pm."
2017-05-20,A drug dealer has been jailed for 10 years after pleading guilty to attempting to purchase a grenade on the dark net.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/drug-dealer-jailed-for-10-years-after-buying-grenade-on-dark-net-10884160,"Luis McMullan, 22, was caught following an investigation by the National Crime Agency and the Metropolitan Police's Organised Crime Partnership. McMullan admitted to searching for the fragmentation grenade on a dark net marketplace, where illicit goods are traded anonymously for Bitcoin. Many such marketplaces exist on dark nets, overlay networks on the internet which typically require special software to access. The marketplaces function like black markets for customers to purchase illicit goods from vendors anonymously. Although they typically require anonymised access through the Tor network, an anonymity network which has received funding from the US government, some illicit marketplaces have been run on the normal web. Most marketplaces also offer escrow services to protect customers from being defrauded by vendors, but in a number of cases the marketplace administrators themselves have suddenly closed their sites down and disappeared with users' Bitcoin. McMullan also admitted to the Old Bailey that he paid for the grenade in full using Bitcoin. The NCA confirmed to Sky News that McMullan was never in possession of the grenade. Following an investigation, he was arrested at his home in Tufnell Park. During a search of the property, officers found 30 rounds of unfired hollow point ammunition, a small bag of MDMA, and 78 MDMA tablets stashed in a small box. Officers also recovered two pen guns, firearms which resemble ink pens, which the NCA informed Sky News were capable of discharging the ammunition that was confiscated. Also found were various offensive weapons including knives and knuckle dusters. Spencer Barnett from the Organised Crime Partnership, said: ""Luis McMullan intended to buy a fully functioning hand grenade online and whilst it's not clear what his motivations were, this is an extremely dangerous weapon that has the potential to cause serious damage."""

Mrs May has said she is committed to protecting the dignity of Britain's elderly after unveiling plans which also include a radical shake-up of social care funding which could see more elderly people paying to be looked after in their own home. :: Manifestos: Where the parties stand on the key issues The policies have already exposed cracks in the Conservative camp with senior Tory Sarah Wollaston claiming scrapping the planned cap on care costs would leave people facing a ""miserable lottery"" when it came to funding their future care needs. The issue has been compounded by the Scottish Conservatives confirming that they wouldn't be introducing winter fuel means testing for pensioners with devolution allowing them to make different decisions. Mr Corbyn is demanding that the ""anti-pensioner package"" is immediately dropped as Labour tries to woo the so-called ""grey vote"". Elderly people are more likely to turn out on polling day so their support is an important boost for any political party. Jeremy Corbyn will tell supporters in the Midlands: ""Where the Tories look to divide, Labour seeks to bring people together. The Tories are now trying to pitch the young against the old. Their manifesto is a typical nasty party attempt to set generations against each other. ""For pensioners they offer a triple whammy of misery, ending the triple lock which protects pensioner incomes, means-testing the winter fuel allowance and slapping a 'dementia tax' on those who need social care by making them pay for it with their homes. ""Some claim that cutting support for the elderly is necessary to give more help to the young. But young people are being offered no hope by the Tories either - loaded up with tuition fee debts and next to no chance of a home of their own. ""Labour stands for unity across all ages and regions. It is simply wrong to claim that young people can only be given a fair deal at the expense of the old, or vice versa. We all depend on each other. ""That's why we are calling on the Tories to drop their anti-pensioner package immediately - older people should not be used as a political football."" Mrs May has said the plans would mean that least well-off pensioners will continue to receive support while ensuring fairness across the generations. Meanwhile, the Prime Minster has also said the idea of Jeremy Corbyn walking through the door of 10 Downing Street with John McDonnell and Diane Abbott should ""scare us all"" Writing in The Daily Mail, Mrs May warned if her party lost six seats at June's General Election Mr Corbyn could lead the country, saying her Labour opponent was not up to the job."

While it's Pippa's big day it's likely that two little members of the Royal Family will steal the spotlight. Prince George, three, and Princess Charlotte, two, have starring roles as page boy and bridesmaid. Their mother Kate admitted to a guest at a Buckingham palace garden party earlier in the week that she was a little apprehensive about about how her children will behave. After chatting to the Duchess on Tuesday, Andrew Bates said: ""She said they were all really looking forward to her sister's wedding at the weekend, but she was a bit worried about how her children might behave. ""She said she was hopeful that they would be good - but you never know at that age."" Prince Harry will be in the congregation and there's speculation that his American actress girlfriend, Meghan Markle, may also attend. It would be their first big public engagement since they started dating last year. It's not been confirmed how many guests have been invited but it's claimed the wedding has cost over £300,000. Locals in Bucklebury have wished the couple well but there are no plans for village celebrations like there were for William and Kate's wedding in 2011. Wynne Frankum, chair of Bucklebury parish council, told Sky News the Middletons had apologised for any disruption the wedding would cause. She said: ""The road past the Middletons' house is going to be closed and all the guests are parking at the village hall, which has been taken over I believe for three days, so there will be obviously restrictions. ""I think the Middletons have written a very nice letter to the people living around and about apologising for any inconvenience, which is very nice of them."" The occasion has been described by organisers and Kensington Palace as a private family wedding, but it was never going to be a low-key event with so many members of the Royal Family on the guest list. TV cameras and photographers will be allowed to capture pictures of the bridal party arriving for the ceremony and leaving the church, but the rest of the event will be kept private and the couple have not sold the image rights to a magazine."
2017-05-20,Scottish voters appear to be taking part in an entirely different General Election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/why-tories-have-a-different-general-election-strategy-in-scotland-10884720,"While south of the border successive polls place Brexit, the economy and the NHS at the top of the agenda, in Scotland there is one dominant force skewing the campaigns. According to Sky Data, 40% of those voters say Scottish independence is the most important electoral issue - followed by Britain's future relationship with the EU on 22%. That's the calculus behind Theresa May's decision to put her appeal to Unionists at the top of the agenda. The Conservatives believe they are hoovering up those who voted No in 2014, and so are tailoring their appeal to Unionists in marginal constituencies. Our research suggests it's their best strategy. Among people who voted against Scottish independence in 2014, 53% of them support the Conservative Party while only 22% of them back Labour, according to Sky Data. But the manifesto has left questions over what Mrs May believes should be the trigger point for another independence vote. It sets out two conditions: the end of the Brexit process and a requirement that there is ""public consent"" for another vote. But what constitutes public consent? I asked Nicola Sturgeon her opinion: unsurprisingly, she believes strength of support for the SNP in the General Election should be used to determine the appetite for IndyRef2. But the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson seems to believe 60% in opinion polls should be the benchmark. At its core though, the section in the manifesto plays into the Conservative electoral strategy in Scotland: make the General Election a binary choice between Nationalists and Unionists. There are other key pledges in Scotland: to support the shale gas industry, to protect universal winter fuel payments, and to revamp fishing and farming policy. But they believe it's the independence recipe which could help them recover from recent dismal performances and deliver a handful of Scottish seats."

Liverpool Crown Court heard how the 23-year-old, and passenger Dean Brennan, ran past Violet-Grace as she lay injured after the crash in St Helens on 24 March. McAteer fled abroad in the hours after the collision - later telling officers he had decided to clear his head and ""go to Amsterdam for a few days and smoke weed"". He was arrested at Manchester Airport on 30 March after flying back to the UK. At an earlier hearing, McAteer had pleaded guilty to causing Violet-Grace's death by dangerous driving - as well as causing serious injury to Mrs French. He did not have a driving licence. Judge Denis Watson QC sentenced him to nine years and four months behind bars, while Brennan was jailed for six years and eight months. In court, the judge told the pair: ""You must have seen Mrs French and Violet lying desperately injured on the road, yet neither of you stopped, neither of you did anything to summon help, neither of you gave a moment's thought or gave them any assistance at all. ""Your thoughts were for yourself, your escape and of avoiding responsibility for what happened."" Violet-Grace's father Glenn Youens had read an emotional personal statement in court, in which he said: ""I go to bed every night cuddling her teddy bear, the bear she was holding every night. The bear still smells of her. ""I cry myself to sleep. I miss her so much."" Her mother, Rebecca Youens, said outside court: ""No sentence passed is ever going to bring Violet back and we are absolutely devastated. ""You do everything to try and protect your child, looking out for meningitis, childhood cancer, and then it's taken away in an instant by two inconsiderate criminals who didn't care for anybody that day apart from themselves."" She said Violet-Grace was an inspiration as she had gone on to save two lives through organ donation. Mrs French remains in hospital following the crash with serious injuries to her legs, as well as fractures to her feet, ribs and jaw. In a statement read on her behalf, she said she hoped to be able to walk again. McAteer stared at the floor for much of the sentencing hearing. Lloyd Morgan, defending him, said: ""This is a young man wracked with guilt, shame and horror that his actions have taken Violet away from her loving family, have inflicted terrible injuries on Angela French and caused all involved such pain and heartache."""

I was given the eye-opening experience of spending three nights with a team of officers on the front line of the battle to rid our nation's capital of its unenviable record of violent crime. During the time of filming, there was an average of one knife murder every other day in London. Myself and Sky's Home Affairs Correspondent Mark White spent our time with PC Joe Broadfoot and his partner in fighting crime, PC Darren Porritt, from Lambeth's gangs unit. Two very nice guys, but you don't want to get on the wrong side of them. Trust me. They wear plain clothes and drive an unmarked car - but every gang member in south London knows exactly who they are. Because of the nature of their job, this specialist team are a little more ""robust"" than your average bobby on the beat. Every suspect they stop potentially carries a weapon. If the suspect resists arrest, which many of their targets do, they are dealt with by force. In one episode, the gang unit were called to Streatham in south London to reports of a knife attack. They prowled a housing estate like sharks circle their prey. When they spotted their suspect, who they believed was carrying a knife, they moved in fast. The suspect, a young black male, didn't want to be cuffed and began abusing the officers. One of the officers held a CS gas canister to his face and screamed: ""Your choice!"" :: Stop and search key to London's battle with knife crime menace The suspect kept resisting and kept abusing. The CS gas was sprayed and the suspect wrestled to the floor. He was searched but no knife found. While giving him what they call ""CS aftercare"", the suspect screams: ""I should spit in your f***ing face you ****."" The suspect then turned on me. ""I'll kick your face in,"" he shouted while being led away into the van. Police tell us his mood changed when he got to the police station. He apologised for his behaviour and was ruled out of the investigation and released without charge. ""He matched the description of the suspect and for all we knew he was carrying a knife,"" PC Broadfoot said. ""And his behaviour didn't change our opinion. We had no choice but to deal with him forcefully. I'm afraid it's the reality of what we have to deal with."" This was an incident which escalated from a routine stop and search to quite a violent arrest, and to the many passers-by, it will have been understandably alarming. These are the types of incident which are captured on mobile phones and posted on social media. And taken in isolation, they can look like over-zealous policing. But I was there throughout. I saw a situation which spiralled out of control because of one man's distrust and disrespect for the police. But then again, who can blame him? Black people are four times more likely to face a stop and search, according to a police watchdog. For the gang unit, it was just another day at the office. If you see them at work, you probably won't notice them. But the gangs certainly will."
2017-05-20,"So does it all add up? It's the question I always tend to get asked when we get a political blueprint, or a manifesto, or a Budget.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-in-the-midst-of-a-near-unprecedented-stretch-of-borrowing-10883330,"But in the case of the Conservative manifesto, or for that matter the Labour and Lib Dem manifestos from earlier this week, it's not clear it's the most important issue at hand. For all that people like to trot out that tired James Carville quote about how in elections ""it's the economy, stupid"", I cannot think of another election that has been less about the economy. All of the party leaders seem happy to have effectively relegated economic growth from their list of priorities. And when it comes to the Conservative manifesto, actually the most interesting thing is what isn't in it, rather than what is. Gone are the big, concrete pledges from last time around: the tax lock which prevented the Government from raising income tax, National Insurance or VAT is replaced with a single tax lock (VAT won't be going higher). The pensions triple lock (the state pension will go up in line with wages growth, inflation or 2.5% - whichever is the highest) is gone, replaced with a double lock (pensions go up by the higher of wages or inflation). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act is out the window, as is the promise to eliminate the deficit within a few years - instead the new promise is to get to balance by the middle of the next decade. These promises are difficult to cost, but they are nonetheless deeply significant: the Treasury will be delighted its hands are no longer tied by that tax lock. The double lock will make little long-term difference to the affordability of pensions, but is nonetheless an important gesture: for the first time in decades, the government-in-waiting is being bold enough to cut the generosity of their offering to pensioners. The fixed-term parliament was dead in the water already, but that new deficit target means we are now in the midst of what will be the longest period of continuous government borrowing since the Napoleonic era. In the face of all that, granular policies and their costings might seem relatively unimportant. But while the Conservatives provided far fewer numbers and far less detail on their plans than Labour or the Lib Dems (perhaps that's the prerogative of the ruling party; perhaps it's what anyone heading for a likely victory would do), there were nonetheless at least one or two in the manifesto, if you looked hard enough. So here's what we know: The Conservatives would spend about £13bn more, divided between the NHS (£8bn), schools (£3bn) and social care (£2bn). How do those figures compare with Labour and the Lib Dems? Well, interestingly they mean the Conservatives will end up spending more on the NHS than Labour (£7.7bn) or the Lib Dems (£4.3bn) come the end of the next parliament. On the flipside, they will spend less on schools than Labour's £6.3bn and the Lib Dems' £8.7bn - and will end up cutting welfare rather than raising it. That raises a few other interesting issues. The first is that the Conservatives have finally grasped the nettle they have long considered and introduced means testing for winter fuel payments. This will save a decent chunk of money (£1.5bn) but may go down badly with elderly voters. Second, of the three parties, only the Lib Dems will reverse the Conservative plan to freeze in-work benefits. This policy is expected to push inequality sharply higher in the next parliament. It is rather astounding that Labour, which has positioned itself as the party combating inequality, is (according to its manifesto, at least) letting it stand. So how about the broader picture? Well, all of the parties intend to increase the deficit each year of the next Parliament - the Tories least of all, Labour most of all. The maxim of getting the deficit down has clearly evaporated from political consciousness as we head towards the longest sequence of deficits since William Pitt the Younger. Actually, contrary to what the spin doctors would like you to know, the Lib Dems and Labour provided us with some decent, vaguely plausible numbers. Yes there are big question marks about whether they could make them work, and more profound questions about their policy strategy (is Labour really wise to prioritise abolishing tuition fees for wealthy parents over improving the lot of those on benefits?), and one or two about how much tax they could really raise. But there were far fewer black holes than there usually are at manifesto time. Finally: taxes. Under any of the parties' existing plans, taxes would be higher in the next parliament. The Conservative's existing plans are set to lift taxes to 34.4% of GDP in the next parliament - the highest level since 1969/70. The Lib Dems, who are proposing to lift income and corporation tax by a percentage point, would lift taxes higher. Labour, who want to impose an enormous increase in corporation tax and on the wealthiest earners, would lift the burden to 36.3% - the highest level since 1949. So there you have it. The question, of course, is how much attention to pay to these manifestos, given key members of each camp have all admitted that the only person likely to win the election is Theresa May. Her manifesto was pretty much as you'd expect: fewer tough, concrete locks, vaguer phrasing on pretty much everything, giving her far more freedom in her next parliamentary term - and a surprising splurge on health and schools. Now, that's enough about the economy, stupid. Back to the politics."
2017-05-20,"MI5 opened a file on Jeremy Corbyn in the early 1990s amid concerns over his links to the IRA, it has been reported.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170520081156/http://news.sky.com/story/mi5-had-file-on-jeremy-corbyn-over-ira-10885001,"According to The Daily Telegraph, the Labour leader was investigated over fears he could have been a threat to national security. The investigation was launched, the paper claims, at a time when Mr Corbyn, then an outspoken Labour backbencher, was supporting convicted terrorists and campaigning for a unified Ireland. According to the paper, he supported one of the Balcombe Street gang, which waged a 14-month bombing campaign, and also had links to a bombmaker believed to have been behind the Hyde Park and Regents Park attacks. Mr Corbyn also shared a platform with a wanted IRA killer, the Telegraph claims, and John McDonnell once claimed that the pair of them used to ""pin people against the wall"" in the Commons to lobby them on behalf of Ireland. Responding to the Telegraph's claims, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: ""MI5 kept files on many peace and Labour movement campaigners at the time, including anti-Apartheid activists and trade unionists. ""Jeremy campaigned for peace in Northern Ireland. To do so, he campaigned for the rights of all to be respected and spoke to people on all sides of the conflict. ""Jeremy campaigned for fair trials and against miscarriages of justice, after a series of well-publicised cases, such as the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six."" The spokesman added: ""John and Jeremy do not pin people to walls. This is clearly figurative language."" The Telegraph says it was against the background of his support for the Republican cause that MI5 began looking into Mr Corbyn's activities. A source close told the paper a file was opened on him by the early 1990s. The source told the Telegraph: ""If there was a file on someone, it meant they had come to notice. We opened a temporary file and did a preliminary investigation. It was then decided whether we should open a permanent file on them."" A file would be opened on ""someone who sympathises with a certain group, or is friends with a specific person"" and the purpose was to ""assess whether the person was a threat"", the source added. The Metropolitan Police's Special Branch was also monitoring the Labour leader at around the same time, but it is unclear if the intelligence was shared, the Telegraph reports. The paper says Peter Francis, an undercover officer turned whistleblower, has revealed that the force secretly compiled files on Mr Corbyn and nine other MPs which detailed their political beliefs, personal background and any demonstrations that they attended. He was personally asked to collect information on the Islington North MP as he infiltrated anti-racist groups in the 1990s, he said. Conservative peer Lord Tebbit told the Telegraph: ""I think it just marks him out as what he clearly is: a hard-Left, Marxist, terrorist sympathiser. ""It leaves him very comfortable in the company of McDonnell, who, as we know, said that they will gain power not through Parliament but on the streets and the picket lines."" The former Tory chairman, whose wife Margaret was left permanently disabled by the 1984 bombing of the Brighton's Grand Hotel, added: ""It's a comfort to know that they were indeed being monitored, although clearly they stayed just on the right side, for them, of being charged with any offences. ""It just makes me feel that Mrs May is being perhaps unnecessarily indulgent towards the Labour party in order to win this election."" It is also claimed that the London Labour Briefing, a magazine which Mr Corbyn sat on the board of and frequently contributed to along with Mr McDonnell and Diane Abbott, was being monitored by the security services. One reader purporting to be an MI5 worker wrote to the magazine on its 25th anniversary claiming that it has been their job for 25 years to monitor the publication. At the height of the Troubles, Mr Corbyn was a regular face at Republican protest events and attended events honouring dead terrorists, the Telegraph reports. On one occasion it was reported in a Sinn Fein newspaper that he shared a platform with an IRA volunteer who was wanted over the killing of an SAS soldier and whose extradition had been requested by the British Government. The Telegraph says that at another event commemorating Bloody Sunday, Mr McDonnell boasted that in the Lobby of the House of Commons he and Mr Corbyn had ""pinned people up against the wall and said 'do you know what has happened in Ireland in your name?'"". As well as attending protests, the Telegraph says that in 1987 Mr Corbyn handed a petition to then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher demanding better visiting conditions for Hugh Doherty, a member of the Balcombe Street gang serving 11 life sentences, and fellow IRA prisoner Nat Vella and calling for ""the immediate transfer of Irish political prisoners to prisons near their homes"". The paper says archives from Troops Out, a London-based Republican organisation backed by Mr Corbyn, show him supporting the cause of Dessie Ellis, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison on explosives charges in the 1980s. Ellis, whose family Mr Corbyn spoke alongside, was convicted of possessing bomb-making parts suspected of being used for the Hyde Park and Regent's Park attacks. The Telegraph also reports that Mr Corbyn toured Ireland in the 1990s addressing rallies calling for withdrawal of the British. And it claims archives show that fellow MPs and members of his own party were ""appalled"" at his decisions to invite Irish Republicans into the Houses of Parliament soon after the Brighton bombing. The Telegraph reports that Mr Corbyn was visited in the Commons by Gerard McLochlainn, the former ""voice of Sinn Fein in London"", who had recently been released from prison for conspiracy to detonate explosives, and Linda Quigley, who had also been recently released from a sentence for IRA-related offences. The pair attended just weeks after Mrs Thatcher was targeted in the Brighton bombing, which killed five people, including the Conservative MP Sir Anthony Berry, the paper says. The paper also refers to a Sunday Times report last weekend that Mr Corbyn was arrested in 1986 for joining a protest outside the Old Bailey to ""show solidarity"" with terrorists including the Patrick Magee, who was later convicted of the Brighton bombing. :: Sky is hosting the first live studio audience Q&A of the election with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn - find out how you can be involved. :: And don't forget to watch it on Sky News: The Battle For Number 10 on Bank Holiday Monday, 29 May, at 8.30pm."

With recent elections showing Scots returning to the Conservatives, Mrs May told voters: ""Come with me as I lead Britain. Strengthen my hand as I fight to strengthen our Union."" The PM was speaking after her party's Scottish leader, Ruth Davidson, made a pitch to Labour voters unhappy with the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. ""Let me do a job for you,"" Ms Davidson urged them at the launch of the Scottish Conservatives' manifesto in Edinburgh. Mrs May told Scots it is time to leave behind the ""old tribal politics"". She encouraged people not to think about who they had voted for previously, calling on them to instead consider ""who you want to lead our country in the future, who will get the best deal for the whole of the UK from Brexit"". Mrs May added: ""It is time to come together in the national interest, united in our desire to make a success of Brexit."" More than 60% of Scottish voters backed Remain in last June's EU referendum, a result which has led First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to call for a second independence vote. Mrs May said: ""I have been clear that now is not the time for another independence referendum. This is a time to pull together, not apart. ""A vote for any other party is a vote to weaken our Union, to weaken our negotiating hand in Europe and to put our future prosperity and security at risk."" She claimed that Mr Corbyn's statement that a second independence referendum would be ""absolutely fine"" showed he is ""too weak"" to stand up for the United Kingdom. Speaking to activists in Edinburgh, the Prime Minister also warned that depending on the results of the General Election, the Labour leader could be ""propped up by the Scottish nationalists"". She insisted ""only the Conservative and Unionist Party has the strength and credibility to stand up to the nationalists and defend our United Kingdom"". Mrs May hit out at the SNP's ""tunnel-vision obsession"" with independence, claiming their record of 10 years in government is in contrast with a ""Unionist government at the service of ordinary, working families"". She said: ""As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I care just as much about the futures of children from Ayrshire and Angus as I do about the futures of children in Kent or Carlisle. ""I want everyone in our country to have the chance to live secure and prosperous lives, and reach their full potential. ""That is because of a simple truth. Across the United Kingdom, we may be four nations, but at heart we are one people. We all have a stake in each other's success."" Mrs May was speaking the day after she unveiled the Tories' General Election manifesto for the UK as a whole, which included a pledge to deliver a ""strong and stable Union, with no divisive Scottish referendum at this time"". The Conservatives in Scotland are seeing their popularity grow, with the party now ahead of Labour there. In 2015 just one Scottish Conservative MP was elected, but this time the party is targeting several seats north of the border, and could even oust some high-profile SNP figures like deputy leader Angus Robertson. Responding to the speech, Mr Robertson said: ""Theresa May flew into Edinburgh today to deliver one simple message to the people of Scotland - get back in your box. ""This carbon copy manifesto confirms beyond doubt that Tory MPs from Scotland will simply rubber-stamp Theresa May's plans and endorse the damage she is determined to do to households and our economy. ""The Tories have done more to divide society, create instability and destroy opportunities for young people than any other government in living memory - now they are asking people to vote for them to fix the problems that they have created. ""The fact is, any Tory MPs elected in Scotland will put Theresa May's extreme Brexit before the jobs in Scotland they should be protecting."

Ruth Davidson, riding high in Scottish opinion polls, said that under devolution Scotland could keep the £300 winter fuel payments for all pensioners. :: 'We are one people': May appeals to Scots The controversial proposal to means test the payments was part of a social care revolution which was the centrepiece of Mrs May's Tory manifesto published on Thursday. But speaking to Sky News, Ruth Davidson said: ""We've made a different choice in Scotland, in our Scottish manifesto today. ""We believe that there shouldn't be means testing for the winter fuel payment. ""The reason that we've said that is - as many of your viewers will acknowledge - Scotland has a colder climate. We also have a different amount of housing stock."" She added: ""Devolution allows you to make different decisions. I want to use that money in terms of the winter fuel payment. Down South, my colleagues want to put that into the health service. ""That's the sort of decisions that you can make in government. That's what politics is about. Sometimes it's tough decisions. ""I say that I want to keep the winter fuel payment here and devolution allows me to do so."" Earlier, Scotland Secretary David Mundell told Scottish newspaper The Herald that the Prime Minister had agreed the winter fuel payment cuts should not hit Scotland. ""The specific view in relation to Scotland is that obviously we have different climatic issues and we have a different geography and there are far more people off-grid, who receive their fuel not from the gas or electricity grid but in terms of liquid gas, for example,"" he said. ""There is a different backdrop in Scotland in relation to both winter and fuel and that's why we believe in the Scottish Conservatives it should continue as a universal benefit."" The Tories' Scottish manifesto says: ""We will also maintain all pensioner benefits in Scotland, including free bus passes and TV licences for the duration of this parliament. ""Social security devolution allows us to make different choices in Scotland and so we will protect universal Winter Fuel Payments for all older people and they will not be subject to means-testing. ""We will focus on ensuring that no pensioner has to live in a hard-to-heat home in Scotland by the end of the next decade through significant investment in energy efficiency."" Mrs May has defended the protection for Scottish pensioners, saying devolution means different choices can be made in Scotland. But she insisted the plans for means testing in England were fair. Labour said the policy was starting to ""unravel"", while the Liberal Democrats claimed the Tories were ""utter hypocrites"".

Produced at the University of Exeter in collaboration with the Met Office, the maps will help acute hay fever or asthma sufferers navigate the worst of the pollen. The detailed research could even help sufferers decide where to buy a house, or where to avoid when going on holiday. In 2001, 13% of the UK population were diagnosed with hay fever. Tracking 12 different grasses, trees and plants the maps show the UK locations of pollen producers such as birch, alder, oak and nettle. There is also a detailed plan of London to help doctors study the impact of air pollution on asthma - a condition that affects around one in ten British adults. Around eight out of 10 UK asthma suffers also have a pollen allergy. New research from the University of Exeter has shown that exposure to air pollution can exacerbate the severity of allergy-related asthma attacks. As research continues, the hope is that one day people will be able to pinpoint the exact type of pollen they are allergic to and manage their condition by avoiding locations that produce their trigger allergen. With grass pollen affecting most hay fever sufferers, those living in the eastern central area of the UK will be pleased to see that they are based in the most grass pollen free area of Britain."

The couple, from Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, deny indecent assault and outraging public decency by having sex against a tree in full view of boys. Prosecutor Miranda Moore said the couple were known to the public as Wadsworth and Mayer, Julie's on-air surname, and had worked at the BBC's former studios at Pebble Mill in Birmingham. Miss Moore told the court Julie Wadsworth had engaged in numerous sex acts with boys in parkland while her husband acted as a look-out. According to the alleged victims, she dressed in a ""flasher's mac"" trench coat with high heels, stockings, suspenders and a split-skirt when the offences were carried out. Miss Moore told Warwick Crown Court: ""Not only did they have sex in the open but they did it in the open knowing and taking delight in the fact that young lads were watching, and they encouraged the young lads to view the sexual encounters. ""The boys at the time were all too young by law to be participants in any sort of sexual activity. ""Julie would encourage one of the boys at a time to engage in sexual activity. Julie was doing the activity but Tony was there."" The prosecution alleges that Tony Wadsworth, who presented programmes with his wife on BBC Radio Leicester and Birmingham-based BBC WM, is guilty of indecent assault in the same way that an intruder's look-out would be guilty of burglary. Miss Moore told the jury: ""She had sexual activity with these young boys again and again. ""He must have realised exactly what his wife was up to. He was there, positioned close enough to be seen and close enough to warn."" Miss Moore said one of the alleged victims came forward after googling details of the couple following a news report about two presenters being charged with offences dating back to the 1990s. He recognised Mrs Wadsworth as ""being the woman who had had a sex encounter with him"" when he was 14, the court heard. Tony Wadsworth denies 10 charges of indecent assault while Julie Wadsworth denies 12 charges of indecent assault. Both deny five counts of outraging public decency. The trial continues."

2017-05-25,The slump in sterling has thrown a spanner in the works for Halfords as it dragged annual profits lower - but the business hopes to take advantage by harnessing a rise in staycations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170525082135/http://news.sky.com/story/halfords-takes-16314m-hit-from-pound-fall-but-hopes-for-staycation-boost-10892135,"Halfords said the collapse in the pound since the referendum last year, driving up the price of imported goods, had cost it £14m. That helped pre-tax profits fall 11% to £71.4m for the year to the end of March despite like-for-like sales growth of 2.7% at the cycling and car parts retailer, which also has a chain of car service centres. Chief executive Jill McDonald said: ""Profit performance this year was impacted by the weaker pound but our plans are well developed and I am confident this will be offset over time."" She also acknowledged that the business was entering a ""challenging period… with uncertainty over consumer spending"" echoing warnings elsewhere about the squeeze facing households from rising inflation and stagnant pay growth. But she said there could also be a positive impact for the business from the weak pound. ""The depreciation in sterling could result in more UK consumers choosing to holiday in the UK, the so-called 'staycation',"" said Ms McDonald. She said this would follow a pattern seen last time there had been a significant fall in the pound, in 2009. ""We are well placed to harness this trend with our leading product and service offering across cycling, roof boxes, child car seats, camping and motoring in general,"" she said. ""We have already observed early signs of this trend in 2017."" Halfords said like-for-like sales were lower in the last period of the financial year but said this was impacted by the late timing of Easter and trading since then painted a positive picture. Ms McDonald is due to leave the business later this year to take up a role at Marks & Spencer. Halfords employs around 10,000 people, and has nearly 500 retail stores plus more than 300 autocentres."
2017-05-25,"If Manchester bomber Salman Abedi was known to the intelligence services, why wasn't he under surveillance and stopped before he could carry out his deadly attack?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170525082135/http://news.sky.com/story/expensive-and-impractical-why-uk-police-struggle-to-watch-terror-suspects-10891865,"Home Secretary Amber Rudd said he was ""known, up to a point"", whatever that means, but it certainly suggests that he was not deemed a serious threat; just one of the 3,000 or so people on the official counter-terror radar. :: LIVE: The latest updates on the Manchester attack But it is impractical to keep a constant eye on more than a fraction of such suspects. And here's why. Full, 24-hour surveillance of a suspect typically involves at least two teams of 15 specialists, each working a 12-hour shift which must include time for travel, debrief, evidence log and meals. If they are lucky they will get six hours sleep, so already their capability is being reduced. They might maintain their level of sharpness for a few days, but then fatigue and boredom sets in, or they get spotted by those they are watching and have to be replaced. So, for longer-term surveillance you need a third team of another 15 specialists to supplement those who drop out of the first two. :: Manchester bomber linked to key UK IS recruiter :: Bomber's brother knew of terror plans As time and the surveillance goes on team members get ill, or need a day off, or have to sit promotion exams, or have family issues, or need to attend vital training days, or special skills or safety update sessions. After only a few weeks you need a fourth team and suddenly it's a surveillance operation that involves 60 people. Sixty people for each of the 3,000 terror suspects adds up to 180,000 individuals, a number far greater than the combined staff of all UK police and MI5. And then there is the hardware. Each team will have half-a-dozen cars, as well as a large and a small van, essentially for static observation through tiny bored holes in doors and panels. :: Who was Salman Abedi? The cars will be ordinary looking, so they don't stand out in any location. So much about surveillance is looking normal to avoid attracting attention. But the cars will have hidden microphones and recorders and often something unusual, such as headlights with changeable configurations. If a target might think the distant headlights in his rear-view mirror have been following him for a while, the surveillance team can switch one off, so the suspect believes he now has a motorbike behind him. :: Theresa May launches her 'war on terror' But a motorbike rider will be part of the team, essentially to locate and catch up with targets who manage to ""lose"" their tails. The vans could carry fluorescent yellow jackets, hard hats and magnetic stickers that might show gas, electric or water board logos. Once, a van surveillance team was following a target who suddenly stopped and didn't move for hours. Posing as a group of workmen the team got out, opened a manhole and sat around it whiling away the time. They were soon berated by a passer-by who shouted: ""No wonder my water bills are so high with you lot sitting around doing nothing, who is your gaffer?"" They simply had to take the abuse, or blow their cover. :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack A team might carry uniforms for members to wear in certain situations. If the target is meeting someone in a big hotel, who would blink at an air stewardess wandering by? Or even a traffic cop uniform for keeping an eye on a target meeting in a motorway service station. Nobody would suspect the ordinary, uniformed cop in a yellow coat is really an undercover surveillance officer. Not everything goes as planned. One team member who posed as a blind man with a white stick found that often when he stopped to 'look' at a target building someone would insist on helping him cross the road. It's a fascinating part of policing, but it sucks up manpower and costs. That is why only the most serious of the terror suspects is put under full surveillance. Whether Salman Abedi should have been one of them is an issue that will be the subject of debate for a long time. (This analysis is based on an interview with Kevin Hurley, a former police commander who has organised and run surveillance teams in the Metropolitan Police, City of London police and the southeast regional crime squad)."
2017-05-25,Young voters are very different to the rest of the population but their views are often not prioritised by politicians.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170525082135/http://news.sky.com/story/where-young-votes-make-the-biggest-difference-10888309,"Why? At least partially because they're less likely to vote. Young people, unlike the rest of the population, think Jeremy Corbyn is doing a better job than Theresa May. According to Sky data, among those aged 18-24, 32% approve of Mr Corbyn's and 36% do not but Theresa May's score is even worse - 31% approve and 47% don't. But across all voting ages, the picture is different: Mrs May has 43% satisfied and 45% dissatisfied; Mr Corbyn has 20% satisfied and 56% dissatisfied. And it's not difficult to see why: young people are less concerned about immigration and the economy - the Conservatives' strongest suits - and more concerned about poverty, inequality and unemployment. There are numerous seats in which younger voters will have a big impact, possibly even forcing a change of hands: :: Cardiff Central - 23% of the population is aged 18-24. It is currently held by Labour with a majority of 13%, but is previously a Liberal Democrat seat. :: Nottingham South - 19% are 18-24. It is a Labour seat with a majority of 16% over the Conservatives - the sort of constituency Theresa May will be eyeing in the case of a landslide. :: Bristol West - 18% are 18-24. This seat is a three-way contest between Labour, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems had a stonking 20-point majority in 2010, but Labour currently hold the seat, having beaten the Green Party by nine points in 2015. :: Southampton Test - 16% are 18-24. This is a Labour seat with a majority of 9% - exactly the sort of seat the Conservatives are targeting to get the sort of increased majority the Prime Minister is after. :: Bath - 15% are 18-24. The Conservatives have an eight-point majority over the Lib Dems, having taken the seat in 2015, but this was one of few seats in the South West to vote Remain - a big target for the Lib Dems.

2017-05-25,"Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi had links to an Islamic State cell which operated in the city, and knew one of the terror group's most prolific recruiters, Sky News can reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170525082135/http://news.sky.com/story/manchester-suicide-bomber-salman-abedi-linked-to-key-uk-is-recruiter-10891692,"Our investigation reveals how Abedi grew up on the same housing estates in south Manchester as a group of young men who radicalised each other - with some fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq. Using documents obtained from inside Islamic State, we have been investigating for a year how this group was radicalised, and who did the radicalising. Information in the 'IS Files' - a huge cache of documents obtained by Sky News - shows how a baby-faced IS fighter called Raphael Hostey, from Moss Side in the south of the city, sponsored hundreds of terror recruits. Abedi and Hostey hung around on the same estates and worshipped in the same Didsbury mosque, before they became disaffected with life in the West. Counter-terrorism sources have told Sky News they have established a ""significant"" connection between the two men as they investigate the murder of 22 concertgoers and search for possible accomplices. Although his death has not been confirmed by UK authorities, Hostey is thought to have been killed by a drone strike in Syria last year at the age of 24. South Manchester, and in particular Moss Side, was once plagued by drugs and gun crime during Manchester's gangland years, but it has seen huge improvement in recent years thanks to tireless work from campaigners in the community. But as the area has cast off its 'Gunchester' image a new threat has emerged - from the ruthlessly effective IS propaganda machine, with at least 16 young people from the wider area believed to have signed up to fight jihad abroad. Hostey - who grew up less than a mile from Abedi's Fallowfield home - used the nom de guerre Abu Qaqaa al Britani on social media to lure hundreds of fighters to join IS, including dozens of his fellow Britons. The IS Files - revealed by Sky News in March 2016 - gave an unprecedented insight into the inner workings of the most brutal terror group in the world. They show the former graphic design student - who left a wife and child in Manchester when he travelled to Syria in 2013 - was the named sponsor for a series of young men and women, many from the North West. Hostey sponsored a number of young men from Moss Side, including former RAF gunner and Muslim convert Stephen Gray, Raymond Matimba and Ronald Fiddler (AKA Jamal al Harith), in their attempts to join IS. Gray is in jail for terrorism offences, Matimba was killed fighting in Syria, and Ronald Fiddler killed himself in a suicide bombing in February this year. There are others who are believed to still be fighting for IS. Authorities have now admitted that more could have been done to prevent them being radicalised. At the time this cell was formed, Peter Fahy was chief constable of Greater Manchester Police and counter-terrorism lead for the Association of Chief Police Officers. ""We didn't really believe that this could happen,"" he told Sky News. ""Suddenly, organisations like ISIS could stream their poisonous ideology into a child's bedroom, and still I think a lot of people believe that won't have any impact. ""We started to see cases where young men, even young women, were receiving this stuff and making decisions to leave their families, abandon their futures and go out to conflict zones."" He added: ""If you look at the pattern we've seen in Manchester, Birmingham and parts of West Yorkshire, you've got some people who are open to that ideology. ""You have young people who may feel a sense of isolation from the country that they're living in and that is the right territory for IS to play in."" Counter-terrorism police will continue to arrest anyone who has suspicious links to Salman Abedi. But none of this Manchester cell will be targets - because they are either dead, in prison or fighting in Syria."

Now, in a dramatic late-night statement inside 10 Downing Street after the Manchester bomb attack, Theresa May has both declared war on terror and changed the rules of the game. :: LIVE: The latest updates on the Manchester attack from the Sky News team :: Manchester attacker named by authorities Putting armed troops on the streets and deploying them at major events like this Saturday's FA Cup Final is a declaration of war against terrorists who want to kill and maim sports fans or concert goers. And raising the threat level from ""severe"" to ""critical"" - meaning the threat of another terrorist attack is seen as imminent - means the Prime Minister has spectacularly changed the rules. Only 24 hours earlier, after an embarrassing general election U-turn on social care, the Prime Minister was being denounced as ""weak and unstable"" by opponents who were ridiculing her ""strong and stable"" boast. Yet after a frenetic day which saw her chair two Cobra meetings, meet police chiefs and visit injured children in hospital in Manchester, the Prime Minister could not have acted more decisively or swiftly. :: Desperate search for Manchester attack missing :: Eight-year-old Saffie Roussos named as Manchester bomb victim :: #RoomforManchester - People open their homes Here, on terrorism, she talked tough and acted tough, with the steel and unflappability she so often deployed as home secretary, unlike in her Tory manifesto wobble on social care. After six years as home secretary, Mrs May was far more experienced in dealing with national security and the terrorist threat than just about any incoming prime minister in recent history. But her predecessor, David Cameron, always resisted calls to raise the terror threat to critical, while this Prime Minister - true to her character - has decided to take no chances with the safety of the public. :: Bomb attack witness: 'It was absolute carnage' Although her visit to Manchester Children's Hospital was ""private"", according to her official spokesman, she cannot help but have been deeply moved by desperate plight of the injured and their families. Some of the sights she saw in the children's wards and the stories she will have heard about their terrifying ordeal in the Manchester Arena on Monday night must have been harrowing and distressing. :: Manchester music legends rally behind bombing victim :: Singer Ariana Grande 'broken' by bombing of young fans Her visit will have persuaded her - if she needed it after the no-doubt chilling briefings from security chiefs on the possibility that Salman Ramadan Abedi was part of a wider group - that drastic action was necessary. What were her options? In France, President Hollande declared a state of emergency after the terrorist attacks on Paris in 2015 that killed 130 people. The measures give police extended powers of search and arrest. Mrs May has not gone that far. Indeed, a state of emergency is so rare in the UK that it was last declared by Edward Heath in late 1973 during a miner's strike and three-day week that caused blackouts. :: Politicians unite to condemn attack The terror threat was last raised to critical in 2007 after a blazing car loaded with gas canisters was driven into Glasgow Airport just days after Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair as Prime Minister. Four years earlier, just weeks before the Iraq war in 2003, Mr Blair sent tanks and troops to guard Heathrow Airport after he was briefed that an attack on London was not only prominent but imminent. Sounds familiar? In the next few days, the world's busiest airport could become a military zone once again. But Theresa May won't welcome comparisons with Tony Blair and his ""war on terror""."

She said: ""We walked out, we'd gone through the gates to actually go out, suddenly something really hot just flew over us and behind me and my sister and we all dropped to the floor. ""I couldn't really hear anything, it was just really scary."" Oliver Jones, 17, was at the concert with his 19-year-old sister. He said: ""The bang echoed around the foyer of the arena and people started to run. ""I seen people running and screaming towards one direction and then many were turning around to run back the other way. ""Security was running out as well as the fans and concert goers."" Anne-Marie was at the concert with her 13-year-old daughter. She told BBC News: ""You just felt this utter shudder of the building and... there seemed to be a smog at the top of the stadium and around you. ""People were dropping to the floor and thought there might be a gunman in there. ""Unfortunately the security were at a loss as much as anybody else and it was just each to their own."" Nikola Trochtova, from the Czech Republic, told Czech public radio: ""There was almost no security check, rather zero. They let us get in without any check if we have anything with us. ""The only thing they were interested in was if we had any bottles of water with us. They almost didn't check our bags, they didn't take a look."" Paula Robinson, 48, from West Dalton, said she was at the train station when she felt the explosion and saw dozens of teenage girls screaming and running away. She said: ""We ran out. It was literally seconds after the explosion. I got the teens to run with me."" Mrs Robinson took dozens of teenage girls to the nearby Holiday Inn Express hotel and tweeted out her phone number to worried parents to get in touch with their children.

""It's thought he flew in from Manchester and flew back from Dusseldorf to Manchester. ""It appears he wasn't on an international terror watch list, so was free to come and go, seemingly around Europe. ""All of this is reported in Focus magazine in Germany today - well-known for its good intelligence sources."" :: Why many terror suspects are not being watched Four suspected extremists have also been arrested in Berlin over the past 24 hours, Brunt added. However, there is no word whether they are linked to the Manchester attack. Abedi's visit to Germany will help police and security services build a picture of the killer's movements before the atrocity that killed 22 people. CCTV footage appears to place him at Manchester's Arndale shopping centre at around 8pm on Friday.  The images show a man dressed in black with a black and blue bag - similar to the one pictured blown to shreds in photos from the concert venue that were leaked to US media. Those leaked pictures are said to have caused fury among police and security services, with Theresa May reportedly set to raise the issue with Donald Trump at the Nato summit. As well as visiting Germany, Abedi is also understood to have recently flown back to the UK from Libya, where his younger brother and father live. :: Who was Salman Abedi? In the UK, eight people are now in custody after two more men were arrested overnight in Greater Manchester. There were also raids and arrests on Wednesday in Manchester, Wigan and Nuneaton in Warwickshire. One of those in custody is the bomber's older brother, 23-year-old Ismail Abedi, who was detained the day after the bombing. Police have said it is ""very clear"" there is a ""terror network"" at work that is likely to have helped the Manchester-born attacker. Sky News has found Abedi had links to an Islamic State cell which operated in the city, and knew one of the terror group's most prolific recruiters. The sophistication of Abedi's backpack device has led to concerns a bomb maker could still be at large. Meanwhile, Abedi's father and brother have also been detained in Libya. Ramadan Abedi, and 20-year-old Hashem Abedi were arrested in the capital, Tripoli. Authorities say Hashem was preparing his own attack in the city and knew about his brother's plot. When arrested he is reported to have said: ""I have ideology with my brother... I know everything about my brother, what he was doing there in Manchester."" More names of those who died in the attack after Ariana Grande's concert are also becoming known. Eilidh MacLeod, from Barra in Scotland's Outer Hebrides, was with her friend Laura MacIntyre, who is in hospital with serious burns. Her family said their ""darling Eilidh"" was ""vivacious and full of fun. She loved all music whether it was listening to Ariana or playing the bagpipes with her pipe band"". Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19, from South Shields, have also been named. :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack After travelling to Manchester to search for the teenagers and circulating their picture on social media, their parents have now paid tribute to the ""inseparable"" pair, calling them ""beautiful inside and out""."

A settlement would stave off the prospect of former boss Fred Goodwin giving evidence in open court on the case, which centres on an ill-fated 2008 rights issue. The judge, Mr Justice Hildyard, on Monday allowed the start of proceedings to be delayed to see if discussions could lead to an agreement. On Tuesday, the High Court was told that the majority of investors were willing to settle. But a day later Jonathan Nash QC, representing the group, said both sides had agreed to ask for an adjournment until 7 June - which was agreed by the judge. Mr Nash said that ""progress towards a settlement remains good"" and it was still hoped that a ""final compromise of the claims made in these proceedings"" would be reached. A further hearing would still take place this Thursday to update the judge on progress. An agreement could bring an end to years of pursuit over the £12bn rights issue launched by Mr Goodwin just months before the lender needed rescuing by British taxpayers. The RBS offer this week represents the latest in a string of last-ditch efforts by the bank to avoid the lead-up to its 2008 cash call being played out in public. Investors allege that RBS, under Mr Goodwin's leadership, misled them about the state of the bank's finances when it raised billions of pounds from them just months before it had to be rescued. Mr Goodwin, along with Sir Tom McKillop, the former RBS chairman, are named alongside the state-backed bank as defendants in the case. The Government continues to own more than 70% of the bank, and there is little prospect of it ever recouping the money it paid to avert its outright collapse."

The device, which first came out in 2000 and was discontinued five years later, was known for its long battery life, indestructible nature and popular Snake game, with 126 million units produced. The updated version has a battery that lasts a month on standby mode - defined as the amount of time a fully-charged phone can be left on waiting for a call or text message - compared to around 11 days in the original. It also offers modern upgrades including a 2 megapixel camera and a microSD card slot to help with storage. When the new model was first unveiled in February, HMD Global, which owns the Nokia brand, said it would be aimed at those looking for a second or so-called ""burner"" phone to make calls and send texts. It offers 2.5G connectivity, meaning the user can only get basic internet on the handset, and there is no Wi-Fi. The phone comes in several colours including red and yellow and also boasts a colour screen - including an updated colour version of the much-loved classic Snake game. Nokia once dominated the mobile phone market but was overtaken by Apple and Samsung as its popularity waned. In 2014, Nokia sold its ailing handset operations to Microsoft for $7bn. HMD, a new company led by ex-Nokia executives and backed by Chinese electronics giant Foxconn, took over the Nokia feature phones business in December. It struck a licensing deal that gave it sole use of the Nokia brand on all phones and tablets for the next decade."

""Celebrating my birthday in Manchester as news of the Manchester Arena bomb broke. The anger is monumental,"" he wrote. ""For what reason will this ever stop?"" Morrissey, who is known for his political views and vegetarian militantism, said Theresa May lives ""in a bullet-proof bubble"" and ""evidently does not need to identify any young people today in Manchester morgues"". ""Theresa May says such attacks 'will not break us',"" he said. ""That means that the tragedy will not break her, or her policies on immigration. The young people of Manchester are already broken - thanks all the same, Theresa."" He then goes on to criticise the London and Manchester Mayors, for their reluctance to condemn Islamic State, or ""say what we all say in private"".

""Manchester mayor Andy Burnham says the attack is the work of an 'extremist'. An extreme what? An extreme rabbit?."" Not even the Queen escaped the wrath of the musician, who called public praise for her words ""absurd"". ""The Queen receives absurd praise for her 'strong words' against the attack, yet she does not cancel today's garden party at Buckingham Palace - for which no criticism is allowed in the Britain of free press.""

""These images leaked from inside the US system will be distressing for victims, their families and the wider public. ""The issue is being raised at every relevant level by the British authorities with their US counterparts."" :: LIVE: The latest updates on the Manchester attack The leak of intelligence to the US media has also angered British anti-terror police chiefs.

""We greatly value the important relationships we have with our trusted intelligence, law enforcement and security partners around the world,"" a spokesperson told Sky News. ""These relationships enable us to collaborate and share privileged and sensitive information that allows us to defeat terrorism and protect the public at home and abroad.

But later, after the leak of photos to the New York Times, the Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said, using very diplomatic language: ""It's obviously disappointing. ""This is a very fast moving investigation involving our security services tracking down as rapidly as possible who the accomplices to this terrorist were, as it's unlikely he did this all on his own, and establishing very quickly whether he's part of a network and indeed if further attacks are planned. ""To do that you need to be able to absolutely focus on getting to the rest of this network - if it is a larger network - as quickly as possible and that's not helped by any premature release of some of the details."" Meanwhile, CCTV images apparently show Abedi moments after he bought the rucksack used in his deadly attack. One picture appeared to show a sales tag hanging from the backpack. The images were taken in the Arndale shopping mall in Manchester city centre around 8pm last Friday, three days before the bombing. A vivid blue flash of the rucksack's inner lining matches crime scene pictures published by the New York Times.

""A strong capable and united NATO is at the heart of the security of each and every one of our nations.

The youngest person he killed was just eight years old. Abedi was born in 1994, in Manchester, the son of Libyan parents who had fled the Gaddafi regime and, like many refugees fleeing to the UK, ended up being placed in the city. :: Salman Abedi: Tracing the needle back to the haystack He was one of four children. His older brother Ismail was born in Westminster in 1993. He had a younger brother called Hashim, and a sister called Jomana. A childhood friend of Ismail described Salman as ""normal"". There was, he said, nothing to suggest he was violent. ""He was always friendly."" Abedi had been registered at a number of addresses in Fallowfield, a community that sits in the shadow of Manchester City's old Maine Road stadium. :: LIVE: The latest on the Manchester attack :: Chelsea cancel Premier League title parade The area, which is dominated by social housing and students, has its share of the city's drug and violence problems - but nothing on the scale of its more infamous neighbour Moss Side. Nor is it a hotbed of radicalism. Salman was said to have attended Didsbury Mosque, where Ismail volunteered and his father, Ramadan Abedi, used to perform the call to prayer. The mosque, also known as the Manchester Islamic Centre, is described by trustee Fawaz Haffar as ""moderate and modern"". Mr Haffar said he remembered seeing Abedi's father praying. :: Troops will be deployed on streets :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack He said: ""I see him praying but I don't know really who he is. I see him sometimes raising the azan, or call to prayer, but that was a long time ago. ""As far as I knew he went back to Libya when things were much better over there, to work over there. ""That's all I know about him. He was devout as far as I know."" By 2014, Abedi was studying business and management at Salford University but, after two years, he stopped going to lectures and dropped out. At the time of the bombing, he was registered at an address in Elsmore Road, where neighbours said he had lived for the last year. Alan Kinsey, who lived opposite, described the man living at the house as keeping odd hours and who once stuck his middle finger up at him when he complained about a badly parked car. He said Abedi appeared to be living alone but had many visitors in the time he was there. Simon Turner, who also lives in the area, said that two ""young lads"" lived in the house but he knew very little about them. Other neighbours said Abedi had kept himself to himself. He had recently returned from Libya and France's interior minister said he had probably travelled to Syria at some point. A friend told The Times: ""He went to Libya three weeks ago and came back recently, like days ago."" Reports also suggest he knew a fellow Mancunian called Raphael Hostey, who left the UK in 2013 and joined Islamic State in Syria. Hostey, who was once described as an ""inspirational figure"" for would-be jihadis, was believed to have been killed in a drone strike in 2016."
2017-05-25,"The production of cars in the UK fell by almost a fifth in April compared to the same month of 2016, with the timing of Easter blamed for the drop.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170525082135/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-car-production-falls-by-almost-a-fifth-in-april-10891840,"Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed that around 122,000 cars were built over the course of the month, compared to 149,000 during April last year. The timing of the Easter Bank Holiday weekend has been identified as a potential reason for the decline - Easter this year fell three weeks after its timing in 2016, when it was celebrated on 27 March. The SMMT points out that the holiday reduced the number of active production days available for manufacturers over the course of April. But the figures echo a similar plunge seen in new cars sales figures for last month. SMMT data published earlier in May showed that registrations for new cars fell by 19.8% as motorists brought forward purchases to March to avoid new vehicle excise duty (VED) rates, which came into force on 1 April. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said that despite the poor performance last month the UK car industry is doing well, with almost 600,000 new cars built so far this year. Demand for British cars from overseas buyers also saw a boost, most likely due to the ongoing weakness in sterling, which makes UK products cheaper abroad. This helped to offset a 7% decline in demand from the home market. ""Overall, British car manufacturing remains in good health with the production outlook still very positive and significant new models due to go into UK production shortly,"" he said. But Mr Hawes did extend a warning that the future of the sector depends on the current trade and customs deals the UK currently enjoys with Europe and elsewhere - trade deals which could be at risk thanks to Brexit. ""To guarantee future growth and investment into our industry and its vital supply chain, however, we need the next government to safeguard the conditions that have made us globally competitive, keeping us open and trading and delivering an ambitious industrial strategy for our sector,"" he said."

They looked at tweets sent to or from a UK MP between 9 May and 18 August 2016. Analysis of the messages found that 188,000 were abusive, with almost two-thirds of the tweets coming from accounts registered to men. The report said the abuse reached a peak on the day of the EU referendum result (24 June) and the day Boris Johnson pulled out of race to be the next leader of the Conservatives (30 June). #Brexit was the most commonly used hashtag in abusive tweets, while #BorisJohnson and #VoteLeave ranked second and third. Party leaders, deputy leaders and prominent campaigners in the EU referendum were among those who most frequently received abuse, according to the research. Earlier this year, Labour MP Diane Abbott said there was a case for a parliamentary inquiry into the ""appalling"" vitriol directed at MPs. The analysis found that 34% of the abuse was ""unqualified"", meaning the tweets did not contain any additional information about why the abuse was sent. Six MPs were subjected to abuse in 10% of the tweets they received, while 34 received none. The ""anonymous and 'safe distance' nature of social media platforms"" was blamed for allowing ""abuse to be handed out far less respectfully than it would usually be if delivered face-to-face"". In a foreword to the report, David Evans, director of policy and community at BCS, called for ""a cross-party allegiance to work with us and existing social media platforms to improve their offerings, and establish a purpose-built platform to facilitate meaningful and effective political engagement online"".

Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the attack was ""utterly heartbreaking"". :: Manchester bombing: What we know so far He said: ""It's been made all the more clear to me this morning as I spoke to my kids, all of whom each had a friend or more at the gig last night in Manchester. ""We know that every terrorist attack on our country is an attack on every single one of us, but this is of a different order. ""This was a terrorist attack deliberately targeted at children having the time of their lives."" UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said: ""My prayers and thoughts are with those affected. Stay strong."" Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: ""For young people to be targeted in this way is utterly atrocious. ""As ever our emergency services have done us proud - and we pay tribute to the police, firefighters and paramedics who stepped up in this time of need. ""Our country will never be divided by terror."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed police are in contact with the families of two Scottish teenagers who are missing after the concert. Ms Sturgeon described the incident as a ""dreadful atrocity"". ""There can be nothing more cowardly than to attack children and young people enjoying a night-out,"" she said."

Hashem Abedi was held on Tuesday evening and is claimed to have known about his elder brother's plot to detonate a nail bomb at the end of a pop concert on Monday night. Twenty-two people were killed in the attack at Manchester Arena, following an Ariana Grande show. :: LIVE: The latest updates on the Manchester attack A spokesman for Libya's counter-terror force said: ""We have evidence that he is involved in Daesh (Islamic State) with his brother. ""We have been following him for more than one month and a half. He was in contact with his brother and he knew about the attack."" Hashem, said to have been born in Britain in 1997, is suspected of planning to carry out an attack in Tripoli and travelled from London to the Libyan capital on April 16, the spokesman added. The Libyan authorities claimed Hashem was receiving money transferred by Salman, 22, at the time of his arrest. There was no reason given for the arrest of father Ramadan Abedi, who was detained outside his home in a Tripoli suburb on Wednesday afternoon. Earlier on Wednesday, Ramadan had insisted his son Salman was innocent of Monday's suicide bombing. He said: ""We don't believe in killing innocents. This is not us."" Ramadan and his wife emigrated to London to escape Libya's former dictator Muammar Gaddafi before moving to south Manchester. They are believed to have returned to their home country following the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, with their son Salman remaining in the UK. Sky News has revealed how Salman had links to an IS cell which operated in Manchester and knew one of the terror group's most prolific recruiters. The developments in Libya follow the arrest of five people in the UK in connection to Monday night's horror, as part of a fast-moving probe. Greater Manchester Police said they are investigating a ""network"" over the suicide bombing carried out by British-born Salman. A man was arrested in Wigan on Wednesday afternoon with officers assessing a package he was carrying. Earlier on Wednesday, three men were arrested after police executed warrants in south Manchester. Greater Manchester Police chief constable Ian Hopkins said: ""It's very clear that this is a network that we are investigating."" On Tuesday afternoon, a 23-year-old man was arrested at a supermarket just a mile away from a house occupied by bomber Salman Abedi. Officers entered an address in Manchester city centre on Wednesday afternoon using a controlled explosion, the latest in a number of properties that have been searched in connection with the attack. Following Monday's attack, the UK terror level has now been raised to ""critical"", the highest possible, meaning an attack is expected imminently. :: Operation Temperer: What will Army's role be? Nearly 1,000 soldiers are on patrol, supporting police at key locations. Army personnel are replacing armed police at sites including Buckingham Palace, Downing Street and the Palace of Westminster as part of Operation Temperer. Wednesday's Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace was cancelled to redeploy police officers, while all public tours and events in Parliament have been cancelled. A minute's silence will be held at 11am on Thursday to remember those who lost their lives or were affected by the attack, the Government announced. :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack Police have now identified all 22 victims of the attack, with the victims including an eight-year-old girl and an off-duty female police officer."

Mr Rhodes, who was smaller than his 6ft, 14-stone wife, said he lashed out after his wife grabbed a kitchen knife and ""came at him at speed"" while making a ""growling noise"". He told the jury he managed to take knife from her, at which point he swung out once and slashed her across the neck leaving a 13cm wound. Following the fight, he fled upstairs and barricaded himself into a bedroom where he called the police. When officers arrived they found Mrs Rhodes lying face down in a large pool of blood in the dining room. Mr Rhodes was treated in hospital for an injury to the back of his head and a cut on his hand, The couple - who had known each other for 21 years - were in the process of getting a divorce after Mrs Rhodes, who was an IT analyst, began an affair with a married work colleague. Mr Rhodes had discovered the affair by looking at messages on his wife's old mobile phone. He had gone on to create a fake Facebook account in order to contact the wife of the work colleague and allegedly threatened to kill him by driving his motorbike into him. Mr Rhodes - who had been living in the loft conversion since Christmas Eve - had begun a relationship with a divorcee he had met on a dating website. Mrs Rhodes had found out about his new girlfriend two days before her death on 2 June. Prosecutors told the jury it was more ""plausible"" that Mr Rhodes had attacked his estranged wife from behind, which could suggest it was not self defence, but said they could not also rule out a frontal attack. The jury deliberated for more than 36 hours before finding Mr Rhodes not guilty of murder."

But their operation has come under criticism in the wake of the firing of James Comey, the former FBI boss, and amid a widening scandal over links to Russia. The resignation is seen by many in the US as the beginning of a staff shake-up at the White House. ""It has been my great honour to serve President Trump and this administration,"" Mr Dubke said in a statement. ""It has also been my distinct pleasure to work side-by-side, day-by-day with the staff of the communications and press departments."" A Republican consultant and strategist, Mr Dubke reportedly offered his resignation on 18 May but agreed to stay on as Mr Trump undertook the first foreign trip of his presidency - a high-profile tour of Europe and the Middle East. ""He has expressed his desire to leave the White House and made very clear that he would see through the President's international trip,"" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News. The President is reported to have been frustrated with members of his team, pinning some of the blame for his administration's problems on the communications strategy. Press secretary Sean Spicer may also have fallen out of favour, according to some reports in the US. He is reportedly preparing to bring in new aides to the White House, and has entertained formally bringing back his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie. On Tuesday he tweeted: ""Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News."" Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News. Returning to Washington, Mr Trump has been faced with new allegations that his campaign may have colluded with Moscow before the election, as his son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner's Russia contacts came under scrutiny. In Europe, the US President and his Western allies failed to see eye to eye on issues including climate change, with a final G7 declaration acknowledging a lack of consensus on the Paris agreement. Mr Trump's comments at a NATO summit in Brussels, which included demands for increased defence spending, also rattled some allies. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had some strong words this week when she suggested that Europe's relationship with Washington had shifted significantly and that ""we in Europe have to take our fate into our own hands"". In response, Mr Trump renewed his criticism of Ms Merkel, saying in a tweet: ""We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for US. This will change."""

Arlene Foster, Democratic Unionist Party leader, said: ""If you want to secure the Union, then you have to vote for the strongest Unionist party because Sinn Fein members don't even go to Westminster."" But Sinn Fein's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill, defended her party's policy of abstention. ""We don't swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. We think that our oath of allegiance has to be to the people we represent,"" she argued. In the recent Stormont election, Sinn Fein surged to within one seat of the Democratic Unionists. Party leader, Gerry Adams, said the General Election ""will be seen in many ways as a barometer on Irish unity"". Colum Eastwood, leader of the nationalist SDLP, claimed securing the option for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU, had made a border poll much more winnable. ""Instead of it being a narrow nationalist agenda now, it's about a pro-European internationalist agenda to reunite Ireland and put it back into the European Union,"" he said. But Ulster Unionist leader, Robin Swann, argued there were more pressing issues. ""People are more concentrated on getting our health service up and running again, sorting out our Education Service's budget and sorting out jobs and day to day issues that they want resolved rather than looking to a border poll,"" he said. Up to a third of Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies could change hands in this election. It is the fourth poll here in two years and some have grown weary of polarising campaigns.

2017-05-31,Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly floundered when asked how much a flagship new childcare policy would cost in a difficult radio interview.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-pledges-major-roll-out-of-free-childcare-10898164,"The Labour leader was challenged seven times on how much money would be needed to extend the provision of 30 hours of free childcare a week to all two to four-year-olds. At one point he looked up the figure on his iPad and said ""can we come back to this in a moment?"" in an interview with the BBC's Woman's Hour programme. He added: ""It will obviously cost a lot."" :: May and Corbyn left bruised after TV showdown Interviewer Emma Barnett eventually told him that the cost, given by his shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, was £4.8bn a year, which Mr Corbyn said ""sounds correct"". Mr Corbyn later apologised for not being able to recall the figure, but said he was ""very proud"" of the commitment to early education. He also condemned online abuse to which the interviewer was subsequently subjected to by his purported supporters, which he branded as ""totally and utterly unacceptable"". ""I will not tolerate it under any circumstances,"" he added. In addition to the £4.8bn for extending childcare provision, which would be raised from tax increases, his party also pledged to put £2.7bn of capital spending into providing more places and training staff. :: The verdict on Corbyn and May's studio grilling The Conservatives promised at the last election to give 30 hours of free childcare to working parents of three and four-year-olds - up from 15 hours - from April this year. They have also extended the entitlement to 15 hours of free early education to 40% of two-year-olds. But reports suggest local authorities have struggled to find enough places and nurseries are facing severe financial pressures to deliver the existing commitments. Labour say they would extend the entitlement to all parents, not just those in work, and end means testing for two-year-olds by the end of the parliament. They also highlight spending cuts which have led to the loss of 1,240 Sure Start centres since 2010 - and say they would put £500m into reversing them. Mr Corbyn, meeting staff at a nursery in Westminster, said today: ""The Labour party believes every child, no matter what their background, deserves a good start in life, and that childcare costs shouldn't be a barrier for parents who want to go back to work. The current patchy support for childcare is holding back too many families. ""High quality childcare can transform a child's life chances and make it much easier for parents to work."" :: The Battle for Number 10: What we learned (and what we didn't) Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, campaigning in the Midlands, said: ""The Conservatives' 2015 promise to provide parents 30 free hours of childcare a week has unravelled, as they have failed to give the policy the funding it needs. ""Too many parents have been let down, unable to go back to work due to the cost of childcare."" Labour point to a recent survey by the Family and Childcare Trust showing only a third of local authorities expected there to be enough childcare places in time for September 2017, with half reporting that they did not know. Most councils reported that they expect providers not to offer the hours, because it does not make financial sense to do so. Currently, the free hours are only available to parents who work and earn at least £120 a week - equivalent to 16 hours at the National Minimum Wage. Labour say they would would also push nurseries to employ a graduate-led workforce, increase staff wages and improve training opportunities, and look to extend maternity pay to 12 months at a later date. The Education Policy Institute, which has looked at all parties' plans for childcare, said Labour's would involve doubling the existing early years budget and that extending provision to this extent would be a ""significant challenge""."
2017-05-31,"The NHS could have to find £1bn every year if retired British expats currently being cared for in Europe need to be treated in Britain, a report warns.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/expats-returning-for-care-after-brexit-could-cost-nhs-1631bn-a-year-report-warns-10899091,"If pensioners currently receiving health care through European Union agreements are forced to return, caring for them would land the NHS with the additional bill, says the Nuffield Trust. The £1bn figure would be twice the amount currently spent by the UK for them to be treated abroad, says the health charity. British pensioners have the right to go to any other EU member state and receive the same health care rights as the local population under the EU reciprocal care 'S1' scheme. About 190,000 British pensioners currently benefit from the scheme which costs the Department of Health approximately £500m a year. The authors also say that if the NHS needs to care for those who now receive care abroad, it will need a significantly higher number of hospital beds equivalent to two new hospitals. They say Brexit negotiators should try to secure a deal which would mean expats still receive care in the country where they live. The report also highlights how health and care services are dependent on EU migrant workers. The NHS depends on nurses from the EU ""to prevent the serious problem of under-staffing from getting even worse"", the report says. Social care, meanwhile, faces a shortfall of as many as 70,000 workers by 2025/26 if net migration from the EU is halted after Brexit, they added. Report author Mark Dayan said: ""The NHS and social care were already under pressure from tight funding settlements and growing staffing problems well before the EU referendum last year. ""But if we handle it badly, leaving the EU could make these problems even worse, given the potential impact on both the strength of the UK economy and the supply of overseas staff to both health and social care services. ""It is possible that extra funds could be found for the NHS from any cancellation of Britain's EU membership fees - but whether or not these benefits will outweigh the significant staffing and financial costs Brexit may impose on already stretched services remains to be seen. ""That depends largely on the NHS being recognised as a significant priority as we enter some of the most important negotiations in Britain's history."""

Frances O'Grady, Secretary General of the Trades Union Congress, told Sky News it was ""extremely optimistic"" to think that a deal could be done by the end of March 2019, while Meurig Raymond, head of the farmers' union, predicted that it could take until the end of the next Parliament for a deal to be done. Tim Martin, chairman of Wetherspoons pubs and an outspoken supporter of Brexit, was another to say that a deal was not feasible in the time-frame, suggesting it would be better to walk away from negotiations and instead switch to the terms of the World Trade Organisation. The Government's negotiations over a trade deal are one of the most crucial elements of Brexit talks, covering topics as varied as the price of milk, what counts as a home-built car and where bank loans can be agreed. A deadline is supposed to be agreed by the end of March 2019 - two years after the triggering of the Article 50 process. However, many within British business told us they were dubious about this deadline being met. That would mean the Government having to make a choice between walking away from talks without a deal, or else agreeing to extend talks for longer - a so-called ""transitional period"". :: Post-Brexit construction skills shortage 'a critical issue' Mr King is one of the best-known retailers and business leaders in the UK, having spent a decade as chief executive of Sainsbury's. During that time, he earned a reputation for both long-term planning and astute negotiation. He thinks it is almost inconceivable that a full deal could be done by March 2019. ""The reality is that this is a negotiation with an unhelpful backdrop,"" said Mr King. ""You wouldn't want to be doing any negotiation with an absolute clear dropdead deadline and we set that process in motion. You wouldn't want to be doing it in the public domain and you wouldn't want to have to lay out your non-negotiables. ""The people we've got have never done anything remotely like this - they will be doing something for which they have no experience, skills or formal set of rules, and that is not a recipe for success. ""When you overlay that with a tight timetable, and 27 parties who all have a vested interest - there is no realistic prospect of doing a deal. It will have to be transitional of some sort - people don't like that word - but I think that's what we will have to have."" His comments were echoed by other business leaders, by economists and also by trades unionists. TUC boss Frances O'Grady told us that she felt ""years would be added"" to the negotiating period, while Meurig Raymond, leader of the National Farmers Union, claimed that ""senior cabinet members"" had told him that a deal could need a further three years of talks beyond the March 2019 deadline. Mr Raymond also told us that he didn't expect serious negotiations to begin until after the German elections had been held in September of this year. Of all the business leaders we spoke to, none had supported Brexit as publicly as Tim Martin, the chairman and founder of the Wetherspoons pub chain. He agreed that a full deal was unlikely to be agreed within the next 22 months, but maintained that it wouldn't matter. :: Brexit: Consumer confidence at its lowest level since the EU referendum ""I think no [it won't be agreed] and thank God for that,"" said Mr Martin. ""I think we're better off if we say to the Europeans: 'listen guys we're happy to trade on WTO rules so if you want a trade deal give us a bell, if not we'll get on with organising trade deals with other countries'. ""If you say we must have a deal at all costs, you can't negotiate a good deal. It's like me saying that I must buy your house, at all costs but that I'm not going to pay market price but what you think I can afford."" The question marks over Brexit are also causing nervousness across British business, which has seen investment fall. Alison Rose, chief executive of private and commercial banking at RBS, told Sky News that the effects of Brexit were ""the important consideration for businesses at the moment"". ""Businesses like to make their investment plans on a three, five or even ten-year horizon,"" she said. ""They don't have that now. We're seeing a horizon of just two years. We need some clear sense of direction to provide clarity, and the longer we have, the better."""
2017-05-31,Jeremy Corbyn has launched a fight back after his childcare funding embarrassment by attacking the Conservatives on schools and the NHS.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-fights-back-after-childcare-funding-gaffe-10899008,"The Labour leader has claimed patients will suffer longer waiting lists and children will be ""crammed"" into overcrowded classrooms if the Tories are re-elected on 8 June. He has been buoyed by the latest YouGov poll that suggested the UK could be heading for a hung parliament on 9 June, with the Tories falling short of an overall majority. However, the Conservatives are also likely to seize on the findings to ramp up their warnings of a ""coalition of chaos"" under Mr Corbyn. The Labour leader's fightback comes after a Labour childcare pledge misfired when he failed to say how much it would cost during a stumbling interview on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. Now, in a speech in central London, he sought to shift the election campaign on to Labour's agenda after Theresa May made Brexit her issue and said Mr Corbyn was unfit to lead the UK's negotiations with Brussels. Mr Corbyn claimed the future of the National Health Service and English schools are on the line in the election and new analysis shows the impact of the Tories' plans. Labour's argue under Tory plans::: 5.5 million people will find themselves on NHS waiting lists in England by 2022, a 1.8 million increase;:: On social care, he will claim 1.5 million older and vulnerable people will not have their needs met;:: 650,000 school children will be ""crammed"" into primary school classes larger than 30 pupils; and:: Families will be almost £450 worse off per child as a result of Tory plans to scrap free school meals for 1.7 million children. Mr Corbyn said Labour plans to invest £37bn in the NHS and £8bn in social care, with moves towards creating a National Care Service. He also said Labour would cap class sizes at 30 for five, six and seven-year-olds and provide free school meals to all primary school children, paid for by charging VAT on primary school fees. Speaking in Westminster, the Labour leader said: ""The futures of our NHS and schools are at stake in this election. ""Over the last seven years the Tories have starved the public services we rely on of resources, running them down and pushing them into disrepair. ""Patients are suffering ever longer waits and overcrowded wards, those who need care have been left without it. Children are crammed into overcrowded and crumbling classrooms. It has to change. ""Labour will invest in our people, schools and hospitals. We will cut class sizes, take a million people off the NHS waiting list and ensure people get the care they deserve."" But Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green said: ""Brexit negotiations start 11 days after people vote and are crucial to our economic security and the future of public services. ""Made up numbers from Corbyn cannot hide the fact he's not up to the job of getting the deal we need."""
2017-05-31,Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been grilled by a studio audience and then Jeremy Paxman on the central themes of this General Election. How did they square up?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/how-did-theresa-may-and-jeremy-corbyns-square-up-in-studio-grilling-10897971,"SECURITY :: Jeremy Corbyn Not easy territory for the Labour leader as he was mauled by the audience on his links to the Provisional IRA and his views on the nuclear deterrent. Perhaps prepped for these questions, Mr Corbyn handled them relatively well - saying he had gone with his party on Trident renewal (""it's not a dictatorship"") and insisting that his priority on Northern Ireland was to secure a peace process. :: Corbyn: I won't be soft on terror if I become PM But his most uncomfortable moments of the entire show included when Paxman quizzed him on the Falklands War: ""Did you think the Falklands War was a Tory plot? No. Why did you say it then?"" Mr Corbyn was then asked whether he would take out a terrorist such as Jihadi John in a drone strike. He dodged this by replying: ""This is a hypothetical question."" While conceding to Trident's renewal, he would not be drawn on what circumstances he would use it in - eventually saying he would ""write the appropriate letters"". :: Theresa May  Having served as home secretary for six of the past seven years and with police numbers being cut by 20,000 since 2010, you might have thought the Prime Minister would come unstuck when quizzed by serving police officer Martyn Hargreaves over her handling of the police and security services. But she did a good job - explaining counter-terrorism funding is protected, and the shift of investment had to move from bobbies on the beat to cybersecurity. Verdict: May win. Corbyn passable. SOCIAL CARE AND U-TURNS Mrs May was forced to u-turn over her key manifesto pledge concerning social care following a backlash from her own party and the public. The plan was to ask pensioners to pay for all of their care costs - in a care home or their own home - bar their last £100,000 in assets, which they could pass on. Amid collective fury from Middle England, the Prime Minister announced she would, after all, also introduce an absolute cap on the total cost of bills. But there was no detail on the level of that cap. Like thousands of others out there, 89-year-old Philip Webster said he was worried about not being able to leave money to his children. Mrs May insisted that she ""clarified"" the position on a cap because of ""scaremongering"" in the manifesto. But she also defended the policy, arguing that ""if you don't address our social care system now, it will collapse"". She was given a round of applause. She was tripped up later by Paxman who attacked her on both the social care u-turn and the reversal of planned National Insurance tax rises in the Budget. It does not bode well for Brexit, with Paxman saying: ""I'd think she's a blowhard that collapses at the first sign of gunfire"". Verdict: Best result May could have hoped for. The u-turn was the biggest bungle of the Tory campaign, but she escaped a mauling from the audience. BREXIT :: Jeremy Corbyn For Mr Corbyn, two difficult issues were raised by the audience - mirroring the ravine Labour has to try to traverse between its working-class Vote Leave base and its metropolitan Remain supporters. On the one hand, Mr Corbyn was asked why he will not be more robust on immigration and commit to a cap, while on the other, he's asked why the 48% who wanted to remain in the EU should pick him over the Lib Dems. On immigration, he says the levels will probably be a bit lower - and on the matter of the why Remainers should stick with him, Mr Corbyn argues that the will of the people must be respected. :: Theresa May A safe spot for her. Goaded by Paxman over her apparent shift from Remainer to Leaver, she insisted that she wanted to ""respect the will of the people"" (cue applause). She added she was going to be a difficult woman when it came to negotiations, and she would walk away if she didn't get a good deal. Verdict: May win. Solid ground. Asserts her position as the Brexiteer-in-chief. EDUCATION AND WELFARE Mrs May promised £4bn more funding for schools in her manifesto yet, in real terms, schools still face per-pupil funding falling by 3%. Teacher and mother-of-two Nicola Middleton tackled her on spending cuts. The Prime Minister was rather boxed in, but tried to argue that Labour's spending plans don't add up when it comes to education. There was jeering and heckling from the crowds. One audience member shouted: ""You've clearly failed."" Mr Corbyn also had a stumble, telling Paxman that he would oversee an uprating of benefits. It would cost about £3.5bn, according to Lib Dem Vince Cable, and is not in the manifesto. Verdict: This was one of Mrs May's most awkward moments - genuine irritation from the audience. But what of Mr Corbyn? It was a lucky escape that Paxman didn't tackle him on his off-the-cuff spending commitment. Hardly a ringing endorsement of Labour's economic competence. MONARCHY Perhaps not a key election theme! Nonetheless, Paxman was keen to challenge Mr Corbyn on his Republican views and apparent desire to abolish the monarchy. ""It's certainly not on anybody's agenda, it's certainly not on my agenda and do you know what, I had a very nice chat with the Queen,"" Mr Corbyn said. Pressed further, the Labour leader side-stepped again - telling Paxman: ""I don't think she should be brought into political discussion."" Verdict: Paxman laid a trap for Mr Corbyn and he didn't fall into it. His remarks that we have democracy where we have a titular head of state and ""that law will prevail"" was hardly a ringing endorsement of the Queen. But he avoided a devastating headline. OVERALL :: May and Corbyn left bruised but not battered after TV showdown :: The Battle for Number 10: What we learned (and what we didn't) As the incumbent, with a record in government to defend, this was always going to be a tougher performance for Mrs May. She came through relatively intact, and avoided a blow-up on social care and the NHS (despite a tough question from a midwife on ""chronic underfunding""). Brexit and security were her strong suit. She would do well to stick to those over the next nine days. Mr Corbyn exceeded expectations and was more relaxed with the audience. He had conviction in his views and managed to avoid being skewered on security and the monarchy. A marginal, slight win for Corbyn, but he has a lot of ground to make up. :: Watch the highlights of May v Corbyn: The Battle For Number 10 on Sky News at 4.30pm."
2017-05-31,"There are any number of curiosities in the fertile, occasionally febrile, world of Scottish public affairs and politics.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/is-snp-exceeding-its-reach-with-uk-pledges-in-general-election-manifesto-10898692,"The strange relationship (or absence thereof) between patriotism and nationalism, for example. The recent penchant for tearing up the textbooks and tearing down long established truths about political affiliation and fealty. :: Scotland 'must have a choice' on independence One might also mention the unveiling of a United Kingdom manifesto by a party standing in only one small part of it. The SNP delayed publication of its policy portfolio because of those hideous events in Manchester, and no one would blame them for doing so. But in its absence the party was often limited to semantics, to arguing, again, that only they could represent Scotland's best interests in Westminster. A strong Scottish voice, a stronger Scotland. Similarly, they continued to repeat that every vote their way increases the chances of an SNP majority north of the border, and with it their political mandate for a second independence referendum - especially when combined with the results in the General Election of 2015 and the Scottish parliamentary elections of last year. :: SNP manifesto: What it says and what it means But recently a number of people, including party members and supporters, began to point out that mere sophistry wasn't enough, especially in an election that had moved, nationally at least, away from a focus on leadership to a debate over policy. And we did get plenty of policy commitments - yet this is where things get tricksy. Take the SNP pledge to raise the minimum wage to bring it into line with the Real Living Wage. Eye-catching, popular, and entirely unachievable by a party standing only in Scotland, given that the minimum wage is set by the UK government. Some have accused the SNP's reach of exceeding its grasp. But even they have no designs on Downing Street. Nicola Sturgeon spoke of her ""support"" for a UK-wide 50p top rate of tax. Yet again she needs much more than twice-yearly access to Number 10 to achieve that, and is certainly not in favour of doing it unilaterally in Scotland, despite having the power. In truth, all of the smaller parties articulate positions and policies they will never have the opportunity to implement. It serves to define them and their approach from the opposition benches. But there are three key differences. First, the SNP does have power in that it forms the Scottish Government - there often *is* something they can do unilaterally. Second, that they're only standing in Scotland. Third, that their ultimate ambition is for Scotland to be independent. Theresa May says there will be no referendum ahead of the conclusion of the Brexit process. For all the SNP talk of a political mandate the constitution is one of those reserved matters on which Westminster has authority, which means indyref2 will not happen until the 2020s. Not what many of her supporters want to hear, of course, so a door to working with Labour has been left if not open then certainly ajar. All the while repeated references to democracy and the will of the Scottish people will echo around the House of Commons chamber. And perhaps the calculation is this - that against a backdrop of bruising Brexit negotiations, with a strong Scottish voice booming away about democratic deficits and the iniquities of Westminster rule, the most curious thing about Scottish politics would be if support for a second independence referendum did not rise, and significantly."

Maya penned the letter after watching her mother Michelle, who has been selected to compete in rowing and swimming events, and other competitors train. In it she said: ""I am very proud of mummy and every other brave boy and girl. Thank you Help for Heroes and Prince Harry for helping my mummy and all her friends."" Talking about how she felt when she watched the injured service personnel training, Maya told Sky News: ""I was like 'wow' because some people had no legs and they were amazing at swimming and stuff."" Asked why she was proud of her mummy, she said: ""Because I want her to get better and stronger."" Holding her teddy bear for moral support, Maya read her thank you letter in front of an audience of around 200 people including the 90 UK team members. Speaking to Sky News, Michelle Turner said: ""We found that letter in her book bag, so it was completely her own words, her own spellings, and it just blew us away."" The UK is one of 17 nations taking part in the Invictus Games with more than 550 athletes competing in 12 adaptive sports. Asked how it felt to make the UK team, Michelle added: ""We go through the whole journey together so we start off and we're kind of a bit broken and then we get more confident and do that journey together."" Michelle Turner is a sergeant in the RAF but has a serious heart condition which causes her to collapse. In 2015, Maya, then aged four, was given an award by emergency services after making a 999 call when her mother collapsed at home."

The suicide attack after an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena killed 22 people and injured dozens of others. Detective chief superintendent Russ Jackson said the release of potential suspects ""can be expected in investigations of this nature as we corroborate accounts that have been provided."" He said there had been ""huge progress"" in the investigation and it was ""vital"" to ensure that Abedi had not been part of a ""wider network"". :: Ariana Grande to be joined by stars for benefit gig DCS Jackson said: ""Much of the investigation has been painstakingly working through Salman Abedi's last movements. ""We have done this by examining his movements on CCTV and other interactions he has had whether it be with people or the phone calls he has made."" He added: ""With specialist support we have also have a good understanding of the likely component parts of the bomb and where these came from. ""Our inquiries show Abedi himself made most of the purchases of the core components and what is becoming apparent is that many of his movements and actions have been carried out alone during the four days from him landing in the country and committing this awful attack."" Earlier, officers investigating the attack searched a home in Wigan and the bomb squad was called out for the second time in five days. Residents in Springfield Street, Swinley, were asked to leave their homes but were allowed back in after an hour.

Liar Liar is set be the highest new entry on the UK Official Singles Chart this week, but impartiality rules during the election period mean it is unlikely to get radio air time, regardless of chart position. The Big Top 40 show on Heart and Capital FM has banned the song from being played. The song samples clips of Tory speeches and has the chorus ""She's a liar liar, you can't trust her, no, no, no"". Another lyric talks about the NHS, saying: ""When there's nurses going hungry and schools in decline, I don't recognise this broken country of mine."" Other lyrics by the London-based ska band focus on poverty levels, schools and police cuts. The seven-piece group is made up of session musicians who have performed with Vampire Weekend, Paloma Faith and The Streets. Describing their music as ""new wave political"", the band said: ""The success of this song shows people are fed up with this government of the rich, for the rich. ""We're overwhelmed with the support and our message is that people do have the power to change society if we act together."" All proceeds raised from the song between now and election day will be split between food banks and campaign group The People's Assembly Against Austerity.

In some cases, Britons with an Irish grandparent also have an automatic right to an Irish passport. Ambassador Dan Mulhall said: ""The increase this year, the first few months of this year, over last year is up 70% - that's the demand for Irish passports from people based in Britain."" ""Also, of course, people applying for Irish citizenship through a grandparent, that's gone up quite dramatically,"" he added, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On average, he said, about 50,000 Irish passports are issued in Britain each year, while as many as 70,000 were issued last year. Dublin has expressed concern over the possibility of a hard border with Northern Ireland as a result of Brexit. That issue, and efforts to protect the peace agreement, will be an important part of exit talks. Mr Mulhall said talks over the border in Ireland were ""in a good position"", due to the recognition on all sides to maintain a soft border after Brexit. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, reassured Ireland during a visit to Dublin this month that he will work to avoid a hard border. Mr Mulhall said a border poll on a united Ireland could be ""something that will arise at some time in the future"". ""Brexit complicates the situation for everyone in Ireland,"" he said. ""We would prefer if Britain were to remain in the European Union, that would be the most straightforward way of maintaining the good situation we have with Northern Ireland."""

Gallagher told the 3,000-strong audience: ""We are together."" The final song of the night was an emotional rendition of Live Forever. One fan told Sky News: ""That was the best gig I've been to in a long time, just amazing. It was emotional. When everyone started singing 'respect to the 22' it brought a tear to the eye."" Another said: ""It was electric, unbelievable. It just caught a moment and everyone was united. Awesome."" All the profits from the gig will go towards the victims and survivors - millions have already been raised. This Sunday, Ariana Grande herself will return to Manchester for a special fundraising concert. Just 13 days after the bombing, the singer will be joined by other a-list artists including Justin Bieber, Katy Perry and Coldplay at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground. Tickets are free for those who were there on the night of the attack. While some survivors have said they would like to attend, others told Sky News it is too soon. Jodie Stephenson from Fleetwood was at Ariana Grande's concert with her daughter. She said: ""I don't think personally I could go. ""I really don't think I could be stood in that crowd and feel comfortable with my daughter, I just wouldn't feel safe, I just think it's far too soon. ""It's not two weeks after that event, the sheer thought of being in that exact scenario with more people and more stars who are even more high profile, I couldn't do it.""

Those who knew Ms King have described her as a ""lovely lady"" who was ""absolutely passionate"" about the animals in her care. Her mother Andrea King described her dedication to the job, saying: ""She wouldn't have done anything else, it's what she has always done, it's what she has always loved."" As well as loving big cats, Ms King also raised funds three years ago for a charity helping bears. Linking to a JustGiving page, she told donors she was going to skydive for Animals Asia. Garry Chisholm, a wildlife photographer who met Ms King through visiting the Cambridgeshire attraction, said: ""Rosa wasn't just a keeper at Hamerton Zoo - she was Hamerton Zoo. ""She was the absolute central point of it, the focal point of it. She was the shining light of it. It revolved around her. ""She will be greatly missed, not just by me, but by everyone who came to know her."" Pete Davis was at the zoo with his family when he saw workers rushing towards the tiger enclosure. He said: ""I heard a scream, then one of the zookeepers just shouted 'run' to everyone that was there. ""We ran to a nearby room that was three or four metres away with some other people, for about 10 minutes. ""When we came out there was distressed people everywhere - there was a couple (of workers) throwing meat over the enclosure to try and get the tiger to come away. ""It had been going on for 10 or 15 minutes then - it was too long."" Police were called to the zoo at 11.15am on Monday to reports of a serious incident, and an air ambulance was at the scene 20 minutes later. An East of England Ambulance Service paramedic crew and two rapid response vehicles also attended. Visitors to the attraction were evacuated shortly afterwards. On Facebook, Cambridgeshire Constabulary said the incident is not believed to be suspicious - and stressed that the animal had not escaped from the enclosure at any point. Jeff Knott, who witnessed the incident, said staff had been a ""real credit"" to the zoo during the evacuation. He added: ""Staff were very calm and professional. All visitors around us were leaving in a very calm manner - no running, shouting or anything similar."" In a statement, Hamerton Zoo Park said public safety was never affected by the ""freak accident,"" adding: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with our colleagues, friends and families at this dreadful time."" The zoo is going to remain closed on Tuesday as investigations continue. Police said the tiger involved was believed to be fine, after Twitter users expressed fears over what would happen to the animal. Four years ago, a keeper at South Lakes Safari Zoo in Cumbria died after being mauled by a Sumatran tiger. The zoo was fined £255,000 at Preston Crown Court in June last year following the death of Sarah McClay, who was 24."
2017-05-31,Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn were left bruised but not battered as they survived tough questioning from voters and veteran interviewer Jeremy Paxman on Sky News.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/may-and-corbyn-left-bruised-after-general-election-tv-showdown-10897977,"In the 90-minute programme, the Prime Minister was repeatedly challenged on her policy u-turns - while the Labour leader was grilled on his past support for the IRA. Both leaders dodged some awkward questions: Mr Corbyn on whether he would order the killing of a terrorist threatening an attack on the UK, and Mrs May on the Conservatives' social care policy. Supporters of both party leaders claimed victory after the Battle For Number 10 show - the first in this General Election to be broadcast in front of a live TV audience. Brexit Secretary David Davis said: ""The Prime Minister brought it back to the fundamentals - who is going to get the best Brexit deal, and in doing so who will be able to secure our economy, our public services and our national security."" And a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: ""Theresa May floundered on her record on police cuts, on funding for our NHS and schools and on her manifesto policy on social care that didn't last more than a few days before it was amended with an unspecified cap."" At times, Jeremy Paxman was scathing about both party leaders - claiming the PM 's u-turns made her look like a ""blowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire"". Mr Corbyn's most uncomfortable moments during questions from the audience came when it was claimed he had ""openly supported the IRA in the past"" by attending a commemoration for IRA members killed by the SAS. In reply, Mr Corbyn said there was a period of silence for ""everyone who died in Northern Ireland"" at the 1987 event. Another member of the audience said he could not vote Labour due to Mr Corbyn's ""ruthless, short-sighted"" policies, which include raising corporation tax to 26%, a £10 an hour minimum wage and imposing VAT on private school fees. Replying to another man who said he liked the Labour manifesto but did not see him as ""someone who could run this country"", Mr Corbyn said he saw himself as a listening politician. And in one of his better moments during the programme, he pointed to his ear at first and then his mouth and said: ""Leadership is as much about using this as using this."" Mr Corbyn refused to be drawn on immigration levels under Labour after Brexit, though he said it would ""probably"" be no higher than at present. Then, in fierce clashes with Jeremy Paxman, Mr Corbyn was asked why he had been unable to get his long-held belief in nuclear disarmament into the Labour manifesto, which backs the renewal of the Trident deterrent system. ""This manifesto is the product of the views of the Labour Party - party conference decisions and the views put forward by individuals in the shadow cabinet,"" Mr Corbyn said. The renewal of Trident was ""a conference decision by the Labour Party and as the leader of the party I accept the democracy of our party"", the leader added. As Mr Paxman repeatedly interrupted him, Mr Corbyn said light-heartedly at one point: ""Come on, give us a chance."" And when he was challenged over why some of his ""core beliefs"" - such as nationalising banks - did not feature in the Labour manifesto, he said: ""I'm not a dictator who writes things to tell people what to do."" The Labour leader appeared surprised when asked why he was not proposing to abolish the British monarchy, saying: ""It's not on anybody's agenda, it's certainly not on my agenda."" During her grilling from the studio audience, Mrs May was accused by a police officer of presiding over ""devastating"" cuts, asked by a midwife to justify her ""chronic underfunding"" of the NHS and heckled over school funding. She told the police officer: ""What we had to do when we came into government in 2010 was to ensure that we were living within our means and that was very important because of the economic situation we had inherited. ""It's not just about the numbers of police - people often focus on the numbers of police. It's actually about what the police are able to do and how they are being deployed on our streets."" Mrs May was then tackled on social care plans, dubbed the ""dementia tax"", by an elderly audience member wearing a military tie and blazer, who asked: ""Why should we in my generation vote for you?"" She told him: ""We will put an absolute cap on the level of money that people have to spend on care. ""And I think what we're doing is ensuring we can have a sustainable solution for the long-term."" She was then heckled by an audience member after a replying to a question on school funding, saying: ""Nobody can guarantee the real terms per pupil funding increase."" Mrs May also repeated her ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" slogan when asked if she was prepared to walk away from Brexit talks. When Mr Paxman asked whether she was prepared to walk away, Mrs May replied: ""I think you have to. In negotiations you have to recognise that you're not in there to get a deal at any price. But the toughest exchanges for the Prime Minister came when Mr Paxman challenged her on a series of u-turns, on social care, national insurance and calling an election. Mr Paxman told her: ""What one's bound to say is that if I was sitting in Brussels and I was looking at you as the person I had to negotiate with, I'd think 'she's a blowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire'."""

The 14-time major champion said in a statement that alcohol was not involved, but admitted: ""I didn't realise the mix of medications had affected me so strongly."" Woods added that he understood the severity of what he did and takes full responsibility for his actions. According to jail records, the golfing legend was picked up by police in the town of Jupiter and released four hours later. Woods had undergone a back operation for the fourth time on 20 April. Last week, he wrote on his website that the fusion surgery had given him instant relief from pain - and said he hadn't felt so good for years. In the update, Woods told his fans: ""My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. ""I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day by day. There's no hurry. ""But I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again."" He pulled out of the Dubai Desert Classic in February after just one round because of back pain and hasn't played in a tournament since. It is not the first time he has made headlines away from the golf course. In 2009, his private life unravelled after allegations of several affairs that eventually led to his marriage breaking up."

It said the safety alert was for some 3,450 of its machines, affecting five models - Beko and Blomberg 8kg and 9kg capacity dryers. They were sold between May and November 2012 carrying the model numbers DCU9330W, DCU9330R, DCU8230, DSC85W and TKF8439A. Owners have been urged to stop using the machines immediately and unplug the appliances from the wall as a precaution. Affected customers can arrange for a home visit by an engineer to check if their appliance needs to be repaired. One of the affected models - the 8kg DSC85W - led to the death of Mishell Moloney last year, but Beko stressed the latest alert relates to a separate issue. The 49-year-old died from carbon monoxide poisoning and smoke inhalation at her home in Birmingham on 7 February 2016. An investigation found the product had been involved in 20 previous blazes, but Beko did not recall the model as none had the defect thought to have caused the fatal fire. In a statement posted on its website about its latest alert, Beko said: ""As a responsible manufacturer, we have decided to proactively contact the owners of these condenser tumble dryers to offer a free of charge in-home check and to modify affected products to remove any potential risk. ""This is completely free of charge and will take no longer than 30 minutes."" It added: ""We would like to apologise for any inconvenience that this causes you and we want to reassure you that we are doing our very best to resolve this matter as quickly and efficiently as possible."" A separate statement said: ""Ms Moloney's death was a tragic and isolated incident. As stated by the coroner at the inquest, the source of the fire within the tumble dryer was most likely the printed control board. ""The component in this repair programme was excluded by forensics experts as the cause so is therefore unrelated."" In February, owners of faulty Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda tumble dryers were told to unplug their machines until they had been repaired after the brands' parent company Whirlpool upgraded its warning to customers."

After a tumultuous day's trading, however, it clawed back to 1.38% down. British Airways' chief executive said he was ""profusely"" sorry for the computer system failure which he revealed had disrupted 75,000 passengers' flights. BA said its IT system was back up and running and that it expected to run a full flight schedule at Heathrow and Gatwick airports on Tuesday, but it conceded there was still work to do to reunite a ""significant number of passengers"" with their missing luggage. The company's boss, Alex Cruz, told Sky News the power outage which caused the disruption was ""a tragedy"". He denied claims from the GMB union the problems were down to BA cutting ""hundreds of dedicated and loyal"" IT staff and contracting the work out to India to save money. Mr Cruz insisted those parties involved in the weekend's problems had ""not been involved with any type of outsourcing in any foreign countries"". ""They've all been local issues around a local data centre who have been managed and fixed by local resources,"" he said. BA has not revealed exactly where the data centre is that had the problem, but electricity suppliers SSE and UKPN have confirmed they did not experience a power surge at BA's Heathrow hub or HQ nearby. Mr Cruz said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" a cyberattack was behind the computer problems. He instead cited a ""power surge"" at around 9.30am on Saturday morning for the ""catastrophic effect"" on all of BA's systems. Passenger data has not been compromised, Mr Cruz said, and the problem has not led to concerns about access to the terror watch list for flights. He said BA was operating more than 95% of its flights on Monday, with all of its Gatwick services and long-haul flights from Heathrow going ahead. More than 90% of BA short-haul flights from Heathrow are also operating, while more than two-thirds of passengers affected over the weekend are expected to make it to their final destination by the end of the day. Other passengers whose flights were disrupted will have the option to rebook for any time over the next six months. :: Passengers describe airport pandemonium Responding to the chaos that grounded scores of planes, Mr Cruz said: ""We do apologise profusely for the hardship that these customers of ours have had to go through. ""We know that there have been holidays interrupted and personal events that have been interrupted and people waiting in queues for a really long time. ""We absolutely profusely apologise for that and we are absolutely committed to provide and abide by the compensation rules that are currently in place."" Mr Cruz promised an ""exhaustive investigation"" into the meltdown, adding: ""We're absolutely committed to finding the root causes of this particular event and we will make sure nothing like this happens to British Airways ever again."" :: 'Worst honeymoon ever': BA chaos spoils plans  Experts predict BA is facing a huge compensation bill, estimated at more than £100m, over the disruption. Customers have been left queuing for hours in packed terminals over the last few days and some had to bed down on terminal floors on Saturday. Many complained of scant information from staff. Mr Cruz was shown a Sky News video of a honeymoon couple who had been stranded for three days at Heathrow, causing them to miss the start of their cruise holiday. He said: ""We are extremely sorry and what we will do is make up and follow absolutely our obligations and provide as much flexibility as we can to them and the rest of the passengers that have been affected."" The IT outage had a knock-on effect on BA services around the world, while passengers who did get onto flights from the UK reported arriving without luggage. Prime Minister Theresa May said it was up to BA ""to sort their IT out and to ensure that they are able to provide the services that people expect them to provide"". Video has emerged of a BA employee at Venice Airport threatening to call the police on a woman who asked about the policy on customers who do not have money to pay for hotel rooms. Stacy Irish, who posted the footage on Twitter on 28 May, said: ""I was told it has nothing to do with BA if customers can't afford it. She then said she would call the police."" Some experts expect the disruption to linger for several days, as planes and aircrew are returned to their positions and the backlog of passengers is cleared."
2017-05-31,Rogue breast cancer surgeon Ian Paterson faces prison when he is sentenced later for wounding patients by carrying out unnecessary operations. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/rogue-breast-cancer-surgeon-ian-paterson-faces-jail-10899071,"Paterson, 59, was convicted last month after his trial heard he carried out mastectomies on patients after inventing or exaggerating their risk of cancer. The surgeon, described by police and his victims as having a ""God complex"", performed many of the operations at private hospitals, using the money he made to fund his lucrative lifestyle. Patricia Welch and Frances Perks both underwent unnecessary mastectomies after being led by Paterson to believe it was the safest option to prevent cancer developing and spreading. Both were later recalled to the private hospitals in the West Midlands where their operations had been carried out and told by different specialists that none of their surgery was needed. They believe no sentence will be long enough for the trauma they have suffered. ""I would just like him to not ever come out of prison. What he's done to us and everyone else, he doesn't deserve to come out,"" Frances told Sky News. ""We can't walk away from the scars so why should he."" Patricia agrees: ""He takes away a part of what's being a woman and then you've got to get your head around it and you'll never get over it because you'll see it every morning in the mirror"". The Paterson case raises serious questions about how rogue surgeons can be identified and dealt with. Concerns were first raised about his work at the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust in 2003 yet despite a series of complaints and investigations he was not suspended by the trust until 2011. Among the concerns raised by his colleagues were the ""cleavage sparing"" mastectomies he carried out on patients known to have cancer. The operations involved some breast tissue being left for cosmetic reasons but led to an increased risk of cancer returning. The NHS has already paid out almost £18m settling claims from more than 250 patients. Lawyers believe there could be as many as 1,000 victims. Linda Millband, national lead lawyer for clinical negligence at Thompsons Solicitors believes concerns about Paterson's NHS work were not properly shared with or acted on by private hospitals where he saw patients. ""Certainly when Mr Paterson was working there they had an inadequate appraisal system we believe they should also take responsibility for the consultants who they allow to operate within the private sector,"" she told Sky News. ""At the present time their argument is that they are contractors rather than employees and therefore they don't' have to take responsibility for erroneous and negligent surgery that takes place within their hospitals."""

2017-05-31,A mother who drowned three of her children by deliberately driving the family car into a lake has been jailed for 26 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/mother-who-drowned-her-three-children-in-lake-jailed-for-26-years-10898360,"Akon Guode, 37, pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, one count of infanticide and one count of attempted murder at Victoria's Supreme Court in Australia. The mother had driven four of her seven children into a lake on the outskirts of Melbourne in April 2015. Her 16-month-old son Bol and four-year-old twin boys Hanger and Madit died, while her five-year-old daughter Alual was rescued from the partially submerged car. A court had previously heard how Guode, who arrived in Australia after fleeing Sudan's civil war in 2006, believed witchcraft was to blame for her actions. Guode's eldest daughter claimed her mother had experienced dizzy spells in the months leading up to the deaths. Justice Lex Lasry described a ""horrendous crime"" as he jailed her for 26 years and six months, with a non-parole period of 20 years. The judge, who revealed he would have sentenced Guode to life in prison had she not pleaded guilty, said: ""People don't understand why you did what you did."" He branded the reasons for her deed a ""tragic mystery"". But Justice Lasry also described Guode's actions as the ""product of extreme desperation"" after her mental health declined following the birth of her youngest child. Witnesses had told how Guode, who wept and wailed during the sentencing, had become isolated from the Sudanese community. She was also said to have complained of threats from the estranged wife of the children's father, with whom she'd been having a long affair. Guode's husband died in Sudan's civil war, which resulted in the independence of South Sudan that now incorporates her hometown. The judge said Guode, born one of 16 children, is likely to be deported on her release from jail."

The incident - described as ""routine business"" for the navy - is the fourth such incident in the past two months, The Portsmouth-based patrol vessel was tasked to locate, monitor and escort intelligence ship Vasily Tatishchev and the depot ship PM82. A Russian tug and the frigate Severomorsk were also shadowed. The Severomorsk was later handed over to fellow Navy ship HMS Iron Duke to be escorted out of the UK area of interest. HMS Mersey is one of four River Class patrol ships, three of which conduct fishery protection, general patrols and other maritime security duties around the UK. A fourth, HMS Clyde, is permanently deployed to the Falkland Islands. In January a Royal Navy frigate closely shadowed a Russian warship which was sailing through British waters on its way back from Syria. In April the navy kept a ""vigilant watch"" on two Russian warships as they passed through the English Channel. And a month later navy warships shadowed a surfaced Russian submarine through the Strait of Dover. RAF jets are also often scrambled to watch Russian military planes that fly close to UK airspace. In February, Typhoons were deployed from Lossiemouth in Scotland and Coningsby in Lincolnshire to monitor two nuclear-capable Tupolev TU-160 Blackjack bombers"
2017-05-31,The UK competition watchdog has launched an investigation into Tesco's planned £3.7bn takeover of wholesaler Booker.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/cma-starts-investigation-into-tescos-planned-booker-takeover-10898493,"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will look into whether the deal ""could reduce choice and competition for shoppers and other customers, such as stores currently supplied by Booker"". Booker, the country's largest wholesaler, owns Londis and Budgens as franchised outlets and saw its latest annual pre-tax profits jump 15% to £174m. After an initial phase, running until 25 July, the CMA could allow the deal. Or, if it identifies potential problems, it will refer the takeover for an in-depth investigation which could last up to 24 weeks ""unless the merging parties can offer proposals following the first phase of the investigation which address any concerns identified"". Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, could be forced to offload some of its stores. The supermarket confirmed it had filed a formal notification of the merger, which had triggered the CMA's ""standard phase one review"". Tesco announced the deal in January, saying it would create the UK's ""leading food business"" and deliver significant savings for the group. But some shareholders have described it as a ""distraction"" and said it should be scrapped."
2017-05-31,The jury in the trial of TV star Rolf Harris has been discharged after failing to reach verdicts on four indecent assault charges.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170531062238/http://news.sky.com/story/rolf-harris-jury-discharged-after-failing-to-reach-verdicts-10898453,"The case has now been dropped after prosecutors decided not to seek a retrial. The jurors deliberated for just under five hours since Friday afternoon at London's Southwark Crown Court over allegations Harris, 87, molested three teenage girls. But they were discharged by Judge Deborah Taylor on Tuesday after failing to reach a unanimous or majority verdict on any of the charges. In a statement read by his lawyer outside the court, Harris said: ""While I'm pleased that this is finally all over I feel no sense of victory, just relief."" Harris described how his wife Alwen, 85, is ill and the couple ""simply want to spend our remaining time together in peace"". He also thanked the ""extraordinary work and dedication"" of his legal team, adding: ""Above all I want to thank my wonderful friends and family who have supported me and Alwen over this difficult period."" The court heard from three women who had made allegations against Harris. The youngest was 13 at the time of a broadcast of BBC show Saturday Superstore in 1983. She alleged Harris assaulted her after the programme was filmed. Another woman alleged Harris groped her at a music event when she was 14 in 1971, while the third woman claimed the star touched her inappropriately during filming of ITV's Star Games in 1978 when she was 16. Harris' lawyers said he did not remember any of the events in question and claimed the women were driven by greed. The former presenter did not give evidence in what had been a retrial on three of the four charges. A jury in a previous trial at Southwark Crown Court earlier this year failed to reach verdicts. Prosecutors had been given until Friday afternoon to decide whether to seek a second retrial on the charges but decided to abandon the case. Jonathan Rees QC told the court: ""We have reviewed whether it would be appropriate to seek a further retrial on these allegations. ""We have come to the firm view that it would not. Accordingly we offer no evidence to the four counts on the indictment."" Someone shouted ""well done Rolf"" from the public gallery as Harris left the courtroom. Earlier this month, Harris was released from HMP Stafford on licence part-way through the retrial allowing him to appear in the dock in person. He previously appeared via video link from prison. It can now be reported Harris previously asked to stand trial from the comfort of his own home in Bray, Berkshire. He even offered to pay for a video link to be installed but Judge Taylor rejected his request and ordered Harris to attend court each day. Harris' lawyers said the arrangement would allow him to spend more time with his ill wife. Harris had served less than three years of a sentence of five years and nine months after being convicted of 12 unconnected counts of indecent assault in June 2014. The counts involved four female victims aged between eight and 19. Harris, born in Australia, moved to England in the 1950s before finding work in TV. He also had a number one single in the music charts with the song Two Little Boys."
