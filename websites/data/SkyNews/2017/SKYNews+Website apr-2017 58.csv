2017-04-01,The Government is facing fresh criticism over Britain's rail network after it was found that half of all passenger journeys will soon be on services owned by foreign countries.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/half-uk-rail-journeys-will-be-on-foreign-owned-services-after-franchise-begins-10820177,"The Press Association's analysis of industry data comes after the announcement earlier this week that Hong Kong company MTR will help run the South West Trains franchise for the next seven years from August. It follows the recent awarding of the c2c franchise, which runs from the City of London to Essex, to Italian state operator Trenitalia. The equivalent of 863 million such trips were made last year, which was 50% of total journeys, the figures show. The breakdown of the annual journeys made on Britain's railways on services owned by foreign countries are: :: Germany 391 million:: Netherlands 197 million:: France 143 million:: Hong Kong 86 million:: Italy 46 million Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald called for the railways to be renationalised as he claimed it is ""ludicrous"" that foreign government-owned firms are invited to run UK services ""in their own interests"" but the British state ""is banned from doing so"". He said: ""With promised upgrades delayed or cancelled, punctuality at its worst for a decade and fares up 27% since 2010, it's becoming increasingly difficult for the Tories to justify allowing private and foreign state-owned companies to take money out of the system, which should be used to improve services or hold fares down. ""When in public hands, the East Coast Mainline returned over £1bn to the Treasury, kept fares down, had record passenger satisfaction and had excellent industrial relations. We should be building on that success."" Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said privatisation has failed passengers and left foreign state train operators ""laughing all the way to the bank"". He added: ""The case for public ownership of UK rail to end this racket is now overwhelming."" The number of journeys being made on Britain's railways has more than doubled over the past two decades, from 846 million in 1997/8 to 1.72 billion in 2015/16. Recent analysis by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), representing train companies and Network Rail, found that 6,400 more train services will be running each week by 2021 due to the ongoing £50bn investment in the network. RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: ""Passengers and taxpayers have benefited from franchising, where rail companies from around the world bring new ideas and innovation to Britain's railway, and railways across the world still want to learn from our successes. ""Rail companies have worked together to transform Britain's railway, doubling the number of passengers and creating one of the world's safest railways. ""Under franchising, the railway has gone from costing taxpayers £2bn a year in terms of day-to-day costs to contributing £200m, money which helps to fund major rail upgrades."" A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""Rail franchises are awarded through fair and open competition to the bidder offering the best deal for passengers and the taxpayer. We look for expertise and knowledge to build a better railway."" The Government is delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century which will improve journeys by providing ""more seats, more of the services people want and modern stations,"" she added."
2017-04-01,"A ""serious data breach"" is being investigated after the names and salaries of MPs' staff were published on the internet.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/data-breach-as-names-and-salaries-of-mps-staff-put-online-10819714,"The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) wrote to MPs to inform them that a number of documents had been been available on the watchdog's ""old website"" for about four hours after an ""error"". ""These should not have been made public as they contained confidential personal information about MPs' staff names, salaries, rewards, working patterns and holiday entitlements,"" Marcial Boo, IPSA chiefe executive, said. ""I would like to reassure you that no information relating to the security of the individuals affected was made public - no addresses, no bank account details, no phone numbers, and no National Insurance numbers were disclosed. ""However, we recognise that this was still extremely sensitive personal information."" It is understood that the documents were viewed and downloaded while they were visible, but it is not immediately known how many people did so. IPSA said the Information Commissioner had been informed about the breach. ""Our first priority was to remove the data from our website as soon as we were first notified and it was taken down from our website last night within an hour of becoming aware of the issue,"" Mr Boo said. ""We believe that the information was accessible for around four hours and we will keep you updated with further details as we carry out a full investigation."" IPSA launched a new website last year but the old website is still used, mainly by MPs and their staff."
2017-04-01,A huge increase in the number of wet wipes being flushed down the toilet is having a major impact on rivers and marine life in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/explosion-of-wet-wipes-found-near-rivers-10821730,"Conservationists have warned of an ""explosion"" in the number of non-biodegradable wet wipes which end up on river banks or make their way into our seas and oceans. Debbie Leach from environmental group Thames 21 is behind a campaign which it is hoped will raise public awareness. She described the number of wet wipes in rivers as ""completely disgusting"". ""It's layer upon layer of wet wipes and they will be here for a very long time as the plastic in the wipes takes so long to breakdown."" :: Sky Ocean Rescue: How to get involved She added: ""One study showed seven in 10 flounders in the Thames had plastic in their stomachs. ""We are using wipes in our everyday lives more and more and we are seeing so much more of them in the River Thames. ""It is so unnecessary. ""Just don't put them down the loo."" When flushed down the toilet, wet wipes mix with fats and oils and can develop into huge so-called ""fatbergs"", which can block drains and sewers. These mounds of wipes can then overflow into rivers, settling on twigs and mud, collecting on the riverbanks where water flows more slowly, even changing the shapes of the riverbeds themselves. In its third annual survey, Thames 21 and a group of volunteers combed the foreshore near Hammersmith in London, where the biggest concentration of wet wipes has been found - more than 235 per square metre. AJ McConville, who organised the count, said its purpose was to collect real data to highlight the scale of the problem. He said: ""We have been coming down to the river over the last 20 years and in that time things like shopping trolleys and bags have decreased but new issues have emerged, including wipes. ""We want to see this disappear and stop the river getting dirty in the first place. ""Wet wipes are made of lots of different fabrics but often it can be polyester, which is reinforced by plastic. ""The issue there is that once it gets into the environment it will break down into lots of tiny plastics which fish will eat and then those plastics will get into the food chain."""
2017-04-01,Art lovers with a head for heights have the chance to be an arm's reach away from one of the greatest baroque ceilings in Britain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/the-painted-hall-britains-answer-to-the-sistine-chapel-10820028,"The Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich is often referred to as the UK's Sistine Chapel. The public is now being allowed to climb almost 100ft up into the air to see up-close how it's being restored. William Palin, director of conservation, says the scaffolding-scaling experience is ""thrilling"". ""You are within just a few feet of this incredible painted scheme but it's rather weird and disorientating because you're so close, so you get these amazing figures emerging from the shadows."" It is one of the lesser-known treasures of British architecture and art. The building was designed by Sir Christopher Wren in the early 18th century as the Royal Hospital for Seamen. The ceiling was painted by James Thornhill who spent almost 20 years working on its 4,200 square metres of decoration. The conservation project will cost around £8m and take two years. Partly funded by a Heritage Lottery grant and private charitable donations, removing decades of dirt is going to be a painstaking process for conservators. As well as wiping away candle smoke, sweat and air pollution, they've got to delicately repair flaking and cracking. Lead conservator Stephen Paine says it's been over half a century since the ceiling has received any attention like this. ""It's 60 years of accumulated grime which has had a significant muting effect on the painting, so it looks flat and lacking in vibrancy. Of course what we're doing is to bring that punch and brilliance back to the painting."" The scaffolding tours provide a fascinating insight into the challenge it must have been to paint, as Mr Palin explains. ""Thornhill and his team would have been up on a deck like this when they painted these ceilings, so we're in his shoes in a sense."" :: Bookings for the tours are available on-site at the Old Royal Naval College and online."
2017-04-01,Twelve people arrested in connection with the Westminster terror attack have all been released without charge. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/westminster-attack-all-12-people-arrested-released-without-charge-10820451,"A 30-year-old man detained on 26 March in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist attacks was released on Saturday, Scotland Yard said. He was arrested four days after Khalid Masood's murderous assault, which left four dead, including police constable Keith Palmer outside the Palace of Westminster. :: Westminster attack: Timeline of terror Eleven other people previously held in connection with the investigation have also been released without further action, police said. Inquests into the deaths of both Masood, 52, who was shot dead by armed police after his knife attack on PC Palmer, and his victims, were opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner's Court this week. Coroner's officer Eric Sword said the provisional cause of death of Masood was ""a gunshot wound to the chest"". He said Masood, who was also known as Adrian Elms and Adrian Ajao, was identified by fingerprints and DNA. The inquest heard before he died, Masood drove his hire car across Westminster Bridge and mounted the pavement twice ""in an apparently deliberate attempt to target pedestrians"". Pre-inquest reviews for PC Palmer and Masood are expected to be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice on 19 May. The other victims killed were American tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, and college administrator Aysha Frade, 43. More than 35 others were injured, including three police officers. Seven victims remain in hospital."

The images show debris from the jet strewn on the floor, rescue workers searching for survivors and the extent of the damage to sections of the building. Almost 3,000 people were killed in the 9/11 attacks, which were claimed by al Qaeda and its then leader Osama bin Laden. Hijackers seized control of passenger jets and crashed them into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. Another flight, United 93, was also taken over and believed to be heading for Washington DC, but it crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers and crew tried to regain control."
2017-04-01,Twitter has dropped the egg that serves as its default profile picture because of fears it has become synonymous with online abuse.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/twitter-drops-default-egg-profile-picture-over-links-to-online-abuse-10819996,"The company admitted abusive accounts often use the image rather than upload a different one. While acknowledging that some users kept the egg because they thought it was fun and cute, Twitter said its anonymity had a darker side. ""We've noticed patterns of behaviour with accounts that are created only to harass others - often they don't take the time to personalise their accounts,"" Twitter said. ""This has created an association between the default egg profile photo and negative behaviour, which isn't fair to people who are still new to Twitter and haven't yet personalised their profile photo."" The egg, which has been in use since 2010, is being replaced by what Twitter describes as a neutral silhouette, which resembles a grey, androgynous human image with rounded shoulders and a slightly square-shaped head. ""The new default image feels more like an empty state or placeholder, and we hope it encourages people to upload images that express themselves,"" said Twitter. The social media service has faced accusations in the past that it does not do enough to tackle abuse. However, earlier this month, it announced users would be able to block abusive accounts that use the egg avatar. Attention is likely to focus on the unusual new image and Twitter admitted its designers had struggled to achieve a figure that did not look too much like a man. ""We reviewed many variations of our figure, altering both the head and shoulders to feel more inclusive to all genders,"" said the firm. ""When the shoulders were wider, the image felt overly masculine, so we decreased the width of the shoulders and adjusted the height of the figure. ""As a result of these iterations, we ended with a more gender-balanced figure."" As for colour, they opted for greys because they fit the feel of being temporary, generic and universal and it also gives less prominence to accounts with a default profile photo. It also comes in a darker shade accompanying a a figure with a thicker head and body for those who are visually impaired. In the wake of the Westminster terror attack, Twitter, Facebook and Google have also promised to work harder to fight terrorist content on their sites. Earlier this month, a committee of MPs accused Twitter, Facebook and Google of having a ""terrible reputation"" for acting on reports of abuse and offensive material posted to their sites. But Twitter recently revealed it had shut down more than 375,000 accounts in the second half of 2016 because of abuse or hate-filled content."
2017-04-01,"Britons are being warned their household incomes are likely to be squeezed for the next two years, as utility bills for millions of consumers become more expensive from today.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/raft-of-household-bill-increases-to-squeeze-incomes-experts-warn-10820171,"Dubbed ""national price hike day"", 1 April is going to see a wave of increases to the cost of living. Nine out of 10 local authorities in England are raising council tax rates - by as much as 5% in some areas. The cost of NHS prescriptions is going up by 20p to £8.60, and the price of a dental check-up is also rising. People in England and Wales will be paying more for their water and sewerage by an average of £6, up to £395. And the price of a colour TV licence goes up to £147 today - that's a rise of £1.50. Andrew Hood, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Sky News: ""So the big picture here is that inflation is starting to rise, and part of the reason is the fall in the value of the pound since the recession. ""As inflation rises that's not being matched by increases in people's incomes necessarily, they're not growing more quickly. ""So together this puts a squeeze on household incomes that's likely not to just be about next week, but about the next couple of years."" Heating bills are also expected to rise - with Co-operative Energy increasing costs by an average of 5%, adding an extra £58 a year. From the end of March, Scottish Power announced an average increase of 7.8%. Npower has also recently hiked gas and electricity prices by 9.8%, adding about £109 to annual dual fuel bills. Posting a letter also became more expensive this week after stamp prices increased by a penny. But there is some good news for hundreds of thousands of workers on the national living wage. Those over 24 years old are going to receive a 30p boost to their hourly rate, taking it to £7.50. The national minimum wage will also increase by 10p to £7.05 for those aged 21 to 24, by 5p to £5.60 for those between 18 and 20, and by 5p to £4.05 for workers aged 16 and 17. But a study by the Low Pay Commission has found that the rise in minimum wage rates will put pressure on employers - with some companies passing the costs onto consumers in the form of price rises. Bryan Sanderson, the commission's chairman, added that pay for other workers remains well below its pre-recession peak. A statement from the Government described the rate rise as ""good news for some of the UK's lowest-paid workers"". However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has accused the Conservatives of ""disguising the truth"". He said: ""The National Living Wage isn't a real living wage at all, and the £9 an hour promised by 2020 has been cut to just £8.75."""
2017-04-01,The first day after the trigger is pulled and already there is returning fire. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/eu-fires-back-after-theresa-may-pulls-brexit-trigger-10818385,"The British Government has received salvos from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande over how the negotiations should be conducted. Both have rejected one of Theresa May's key demands, which is to settle the terms of the UK's departure at the same time as agreeing future trading arrangements. It's an unsettling start to the process and could lead to delay. First it was Mrs Merkel, speaking in Berlin yesterday. She said: ""The negotiations must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship."" Trade could only be discussed afterwards. Then this morning Mr Hollande told the PM during a phone conversation that he also thought the terms of withdrawal should come first. Settle that, then discuss future trading deals. This doesn't work for the UK. It's clear the PM doesn't want to pay up her divorce bill without knowing how much access she will have to the kids. But who is right on this and who is likely to get their way? So far the Government hasn't budged. The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said this morning on Sky News: ""We've got to debate this"" as he defended the Government's view that talks over the UK's departure should run in parallel with future trade negotiations."" He insists that Mrs Merkel doesn't have the final word, saying: ""It's a negotiation and we want to do it in a certain way."" The Brexit Secretary believes it is the Commission rather than the member states that has been pushing to complete the departure bill first and the trade deal second. But he adds: ""Article 50 says the departure should be negotiated taking into account the ongoing deal."" ""It makes it pretty plain they've got to be done together. ""We think that's a smart way to do it, because everybody then can make a judgement as to what's a good outcome for everybody - what the balance of outcomes are."" He is right that this is specified in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. It states that if a country chooses to leave, ""the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union"". This is open to interpretation, however. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the European Parliament's Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, told Adam Boulton's All Out Politics on Sky News: ""The treaty is very clear about this. ""In Article 50 it's stipulated that first of all you do the withdrawal agreement in the light of your future relationship between the UK and the EU."" So Mrs Merkel's view seems to have growing support, whereas this morning, when asked by Sky News, the PM's spokesman was unwilling or unable to name any leaders who supported Mrs May on this. In some ways, Mrs Merkel's position on dismissing the idea of parallel negotiations is strengthened by Mrs May's approach to Brexit. In her Lancaster House speech in January, the PM was explicit that the UK wanted a clean break from the EU, saying she did ""not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave"". It is therefore quite easy for the Europeans to offer the UK the clean break it wants - settling assets and liabilities, paying off the divorce bill and then saying only afterwards we should look at the future trading relationship. If the UK had begun with an approach that it might want to retain some aspects of EU membership, this would have made it much more difficult to split the negotiations into two parts. It could however argue that there will still be aspects of shared interests, such as ongoing investment in scientific research, and that these things need to be settled and agreed upon before the divorce bill can be known. When Sky News asked Number 10 whether the divorce bill was a negotiating chip for a possible future trading deal with the EU, the PM's spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment on negotiation strategy. It seems the negotiation over the negotiation could drag on and certainly it is unlikely to be settled until after the Council of Europe meets on 29 April. Here ministers will decide the guidelines for negotiations. Mr Davis says ""that's the point at which we should start saying 'OK, we agree here, we disagree there'"". But it's a worry that in the first battle of this negotiation, the EU's biggest players are so openly opposed to the UK's planned approach."

They paid as much as $35,000 (£27,900) for the infomercial-like seminars, lured by what they described as ""false promises"" of Mr Trump's investing secrets from his ""hand-picked"" instructors. Students said they had been constantly pressured to spend more money but that the university had failed to deliver on the promises. The Trump University closed in 2010. Mr Trump vowed to fight the fraud claims during his presidential campaign, but then agreed to settle the cases soon after his election win in November. He said he was too busy for a trial, despite being adamant that he would have won. Under the terms of the settlement, Mr Trump does not admit any wrongdoing. Sky News US Correspondent Amanda Walker said: ""It was a problem for him during his campaign, with hundreds of people coming forward saying that Trump University was not what it proclaimed to be, that it wasn't a university of any kind. ""Part of that settlement is actually $1m to the state of New York for those misleading claims that it was a university."" During his campaign, Mr Trump even criticised Gonzalo Curiel, who gave the settlement the final nod, implying the Indiana-born judge's Mexican heritage made him biased. Judge Curiel said the settlement ""provides significant and immediate recovery"" and that only two of about 7,000 eligible class action members had objected to its terms. Sky's Amanda Walker said: ""The way (Trump's team) is shaping this is that Donald Trump needs to focus on running the country. ""If he hadn't paid up he would have had to testify, that would have become a distraction from his presidency, so now this is out of the way, he can focus on that. ""But for those people who were involved in this case and for those who have criticised his handling of what was called his university, this is an example of his fraudulent activity as a businessman and it's another criticism, certainly from people who didn't agree with him during his campaign, that he's not fit to be president."""

The clause has inflamed tensions over the status of 'the Rock', which has been held by the UK since 1713 and is home to UK military bases. Chief minister Fabian Picardo said that Spain was ""employing her unhealthy obsession with Gibraltar and bringing it to the table of a very complex negotiation already"". :: What is the row over Gibraltar all about? Insisting that the guidelines would allow Spain ""to discriminate against the British people of Gibraltar"", he said: ""Gibraltar is not going to be a political pawn in Brexit, neither is it going to be a victim of Brexit. ""Gibraltar is going to be very prosperous, very successful and entirely British before, during and after Brexit."" Good to speak to #Gibraltar Chief Minister @FabianPicardo. As ever, the UK remains implacable & rock-like in our support for Gibraltar Mr Picardo said he had spoken to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who he described as ""implacable"" in the defence of the rights of Gibraltar. :: EU tells UK to settle Brexit bill before trade talks Describing its future ""as even more British after Brexit than it is now"", he said: ""The whole of Europe will see that Spain is trying to abuse this moment for her own selfish political purposes."" The European Council's negotiating principles state: ""After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom."" It hands Spain, which has long held ambitions to reclaim sovereignty of the territory, significant power over Gibraltar's future. Unless Theresa May is prepared to sacrifice the future of Gibraltar's 30,000 inhabitants to secure a good deal for the rest of the UK then she could have to make concessions to Spain. The draft guidelines also stipulate that the UK must settle its Brexit bill and agree the future of EU citizens in the UK before trade deal talks could start. Julie Girling, MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, told Sky News: ""There is something that the Spanish want that we have... fishing grounds. Let's start telling them how tough we're going to be in this area."" Labour MP and Open Britain campaigner Mary Creagh said ""Brextremists"" had destabilised the situation in the British Overseas Territory. ""The decision to leave the European Union has thrown Gibraltar's future up into the air,"" she said. Up to 12,000 people who live in Spain come to work in Gibraltar every day. Some 96% of Gibraltar's citizens voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. In 2002, they also voted to reject the idea of shared sovereignty between the UK and Spain, with 99% of citizens voting to remain under British jurisdiction."

Its comments relate to the SAVE organisation - an animal rights group which started in the US but now has more than 20 branches in the UK. In November 2016 the East London Chicken SAVE group blocked a lorry carrying crates of chickens to an abattoir. The protest became heated with abuse shouted at workers. Police were called but no one was arrested. On its website, SAVE says it is a ""love-based non-violent group"" and urges its members to refrain from any ""loud or threatening behaviour"". The vast majority of SAVE vigils - which are held as animals are driven into abattoirs - are peaceful. But the BMPA says it is concerned about the number of activists not adhering to the group's guidelines. It said: ""We respect the rights of the protesters to mount vigils and that they have strong views. In return we expect them to be peaceful and civilised in their approach to vigils at our members' sites. ""Our members do have concerns that it is only a matter of time before someone is hurt as a result of this behaviour and we continue to work closely with local police forces in order to ensure everyone's safety."" Kirsty Henderson from PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) told Sky News the violent protests are rare. ""The SAVE movement is a mainstream movement made up of people around the world. They hold candlelit vigils outside slaughterhouses and give the animals who are destined to have their throats cut in just a few minutes their last semblance of life, some comfort. It is really a movement based on no violence."" Chrissy Dean is an animal rights activist from SAVE's Manchester group. At a peaceful protest, she told Sky News why she attends the vigils moments before the animals are killed. ""I just love animals and I just think that everything that is living has a right to live. Those pigs don't want to die. I've seen them just run around fields and be free. I'm a mother and they are babies. They just don't deserve to be treated in the way they are treated."" The meat industry says it will continue to work with police to ensure the safety of those it represents."

Asked if he was prepared to do the same, Mr Adams replied: ""Yes, I have said and Martin and I said this together and we've said it quite a few times, that we would both do our best and we would also encourage other Republicans to come forward if there was a satisfactory arrangement put in place and that's my commitment. ""Martin's not here, but that's still my commitment."" Mr Adams denied that his party was focused only on the actions of British soldiers during the conflict. ""Our position has been for an international, independent truth commission that everybody can make use of but we compromised on this issue,"" he said. ""I believe that victims of the IRA, or at least their relatives, have the right to truth and I believe that those who are victims of British Army violence or state violence also have the right to truth and the British government is holding that back."" He said power-sharing had collapsed because Unionists had reneged on commitments, adding: ""Martin McGuinness was big and strong and formidable enough to carry that to a certain degree for the rest of us. ""Martin's gone so even if we were able to cobble together something tomorrow, it wouldn't last. I want it to be sustainable."" He said the current negotiations were the first since 1972 that he had been without Mr McGuinness. On Brexit, he claimed the only way to avoid a hard border was for Northern Ireland to have designated status within the EU and denied that would be a united Ireland by the back door. Mr Adams said his party was exploring the option of requesting a referendum on Irish unity but didn't want to ""exploit the consequences of Brexit"".

She is believed to be with six-year-old Dylan Madge and Louis Madge, aged nine. Police issued a missing person appeal on Tuesday, and a day later said they are treating the disappearance as an abduction. On Monday, Nottingham Family Court ordered the two boys be removed from the care of their mother. In a highly unusual move, the court has now issued a statement in which it said: ""It is assumed that she has abducted Louis and Dylan. The children have now been made wards of court. ""Miss Baldwin is considered to pose a risk of harm to the children."" Nottinghamshire Police have said Ms Baldwin could be ""harboured by someone"", may have used a different name or changed her or the boys' appearance. They have urged bed and breakfast operators and hotel and guest house owners and staff to check their registers. Superintendent Rich Fretwell said police were ""increasingly concerned"" for the boys' welfare and safety. ""Samantha has no legal custody of the boys at this time,"" he said. ""Our investigation team are exploring a number of lines of inquiry. There's always the possibility that Samantha could be being harboured by someone. ""We would urge that person to come forward and let us know where the boys are."" Two women, aged 62 and 36, have been released on bail after their arrest on suspicion of assisting an offender. Ms Baldwin is described as 5ft 7in, of slim build, with shoulder-length blonde hair and green-blue eyes; Louis has collar-length straight fair hair, a fair complexion and blue eyes, while his brother Dylan has collar-length straight brown hair, a tanned complexion and brown eyes. Anyone with information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101 urgently, quoting incident number 332 of March 27."

The Government offers the equity loan to buyers of newly-built properties worth up to £600,000. Figures show almost 4,000 households in England earning more than £100,000 per year have bought a home using the programme, out of a total of 112,338 that have used it. And more than 20,000 households - nearly a fifth - were not first-time buyers, compared to 90,000 who were. Shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""I don't think it's right that taxpayers' help is going to people who are earning over £100,000, many of whom say they could have afforded to buy that without that help."" Speaking on told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: ""A lot of this help is not even going to people who are buying for the first time. ""So ministers have got to do a great deal more to target this scheme on help for those with ordinary incomes, younger people who really need the help most."" Mr Healey said the scheme should be limited to people getting on the housing ladder and proposed a ban on people with ""sky-high incomes"" from getting the support - although he did not give a figure. ""This is a scheme that is part of nearly £43 billion set to go from the taxpayer in support of commercial housebuilders over the next few years,"" he said. ""In many ways, Help To Buy is a blank cheque from ministers which housebuilders are cashing in on."" A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""Since 2010, Government-backed schemes have helped more than 362,000 households to buy a home, with the number of first-time buyers more than doubling since 2009. The spokesman said the Government is determined to ""fix the broken housing market so that homes are more affordable and people have the security they need to plan for the future - and our recent housing white paper set out the measures to do just that""."

The elephant is said to have disappeared into the bush after the incident. ""I don't know if he was part of a herd, said Mr Gericke. ""The elephant was already gone when we arrived."" Officials are investigating the woman's death. The details of the injuries sustained by the other woman are unclear. There have been rare reports of elephants killing or injuring villagers in parts of Africa. They are sometimes attacked by villagers trying to protect their crops. Kruger National Park, one of South Africa's best-known wildlife parks, has seen a few instances of elephants charging cars which get too close. In December 2013, one elephant charged at a car carrying British woman Sarah Brooks and a South African man. One of the tusks stabbed her in the thigh, while the man had minor injuries."

Kacey Adams, 34, and Daniel Wallace, 33, made off with around £50,000 in the raid on a bungalow in Halstead, Kent in April 2016. They were arrested as they flew back from Dubai the following month and their luggage was found to contain more than £18,000 of luxury goods. Before the attack, victim Janis Buswell was knitting clothes for her expected great-grandchild and husband John was watching a boxing match on TV. Adams and Wallace tied them up and tortured them for two hours, demanding to know the codes for their safes, Chelmsford Crown Court was told. They tipped a kettle of boiling water over Mrs Buswell's head, which made her husband so angry he broke free from his cable ties, the court heard. The men, wearing all black, threatened him with a knife, and he took them to a bathroom safe containing £3,000-£5,000. Adams, who wore a mask, and Wallace, who had a hoodie drawn tight around his face, then tipped a second kettle of boiling water over Mrs Buswell, 64, and said they knew there was more money. ""She was screaming in terrible pain,"" said prosecutor Tracy Ayling QC Mr Buswell, 66, took the men to a second safe, hidden under the floor, which contained around £40,000. Their ordeal continued as the men tipped boiling water over his head, threatened to chop off his wife's fingers with a knife and his ears with scissors. The men also told Mr Buswell they were going to ""dig his wife's eye out then they would see where the fifties were"", said Ms Ayling. ""They said they knew he changed £50 notes in the local pub,"" she said. ""They said they knew where members of the family lived and said 'we're going to get your grandchildren'."" After the men fled with cash and jewellery, Mr Buswell was able to untie himself and raise the alarm. His wife suffered burns to a fifth of her body, was placed in an induced coma and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She said the criminals' behaviour was ""barbaric"". Adams and Wallace have both admitted aggravated burglary and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The two men smirked and chatted to each other throughout the sentencing hearing in Chelmsford and are set to hear their punishment on Monday. A third burglar has never been caught, while a fourth man Drew Morris, 27, admitted to being the getaway driver but said he did not enter the house or know what was going to happen."

Mr Wilkinson remains in hospital in a serious condition with stab wounds to his chest and back after all three were attacked at a property in Greyhound Lane. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called to the property just after 8am and discovered Mrs Wilkinson and Pierce inside the house and Mr Wilkinson in the garden.

Police said officers had ""intercepted"" the car and pictures showed it had apparently hit a wall. Stephen Dunster, executive headteacher of Stourbridge's Redhill School, paid tribute to Pierce. He said: ""Pierce was a loyal, caring and conscientious pupil who will be sadly missed by all members of our school community. He always met everyone with a smile and was a kind and thoughtful young man. ""He was passionate about his football team, West Bromwich Albion, and was devoted to his pet greyhound dog. ""He was a loving son and brother. Our thoughts and prayers remain with his family, in particular his father Peter and sister Lydia."" The couple's daughter, Lydia, was away from home at university.

The 60-year-old has also been given a 12-month supervision order and will have to wear an electronic tag and carry out 150 hours' unpaid work. Senior Fiscal Depute Martin Allan told Glasgow Sheriff Court that a neighbour spotted Clarke driving out of the car park of his home in the Baillieston area of Glasgow and called the police. ""Both were suspicious about his ability to drive because of the media coverage and they did some research online and found that his licence had been revoked on medical grounds. They called the police at 8.04pm. ""While waiting for the police between 10.15pm and 10.20pm, they saw his car return again to the car park and it parked up in the usual space. ""He got out and went to the boot to get carrier bags."" Police went to Clarke's home on September 22 and he was cautioned and charged. The court heard that he told police: ""I have never been out on a public road, I've just moved the car in the private car park."" Ross Yuill, defending Clarke, said his client drove from the car park of his block of flats through a tunnel onto Buchanan Street and parked near the main entrance to the building so that he could unload some heavy items. He said Mr Clarke drove around 30 yards on the public road, and added ""he wholly accepts that that decision was a gross error of judgment."" Sheriff Martin Jones QC told Clarke he passed the ""custody threshold"" but that he was legally prevented from jailing him because he was a first offender. He said that following the bin lorry crash Clarke was diagnosed with a medical condition that sometimes resulted in temporary loss of consciousness. He said: ""The history you provided suggested that you had no prior warning before the episode of December 2014 which made it very difficult to predict whether the episodes will ever recur."" Six people died and another 15 were injured in December 2014 when Clarke lost control of his refuse lorry in the city centre. He was not prosecuted over the crash after the Crown Office said there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal proceedings. Jack and Lorraine Sweeney, 68 and 69, and their granddaughter Erin McQuade, 18, Stephenie Tait, 29, Jacqueline Morton, 51, and Gillian Ewing, 52, died. A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) heard Clarke had history of health issues but did not tell his employers or the DVLA about his medical background."

2017-04-01,"Nine months on from referendum result, the ball is rolling on Brexit and the daunting workload involved is becoming clearer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/is-there-anything-beyond-brexit-10819710,"But while Theresa May will be remembered as the Prime Minister who steered Britain out of the European Union, is there room for anything else? It's an active debate at the heart of Government. The reasons are obvious. Today's newspapers lead on the acute pressures on social care, with a damning report from MPs showing funding is in freefall. Elderly people who pay their own way (because they have assets of more than £23,250) are being charged even more to cover the increasing toll of those whose care is covered by the state. Meanwhile, the NHS - which featured heavily in the Leave campaign - has axed its 18-week limit for operations. The four-hour A&E target limps on, but the last time it was met was the summer of 2015. In one horrifyingly case, Kayden Urmston-Bancroft, aged 20 months, died after his operation was cancelled for three days running. Such a story would once have had a Government on the ropes. Schools funding is also on the political agenda in a way it hasn't been for years, with parents asked to buy their own textbooks as head teachers grapple with funding gaps. For patients awaiting operations, parents worried about school places and the legions of young people working but with no hope of buying a home, there are more immediate concerns than Brexit over the next two years. Theresa May is acutely aware of all this. She declared in her party conference speech in October that the referendum vote was ""not just a vote to withdraw from the EU, it was about something broader"". ""It was about a sense deep, profound and let's face it often justified - that many people have today that the world works well for a privileged few, but not for them."" The Queen's speech on 17 May is a chance, Tory MPs say, to put her sentiment - about broken markets, burning injustices and building infrastructure - into action. But it will be dominated by Brexit-related bills. ""There will be some domestic stuff, but all likelihood it will be Brexit with bells on"", a senior Conservative tells me. A relatively quiet group of MPs and ministers believe making the most of Brexit means turbo-charging economic reforms now to meet the need of the future - on skills, apprenticeships and rebalancing the economy away from London and the financial services sector. ""We need to prepare for global Britain now, or we're just promising jam tomorrow. But there's real debate about whether the Government has the bandwidth for it"", says one figure familiar with discussions in Number 10. Education and skills and a bill about workplace practices are expected to feature in the speech, but they won't be the headlines. Deep thinking about public services is under way, but in the medium term there are only sticking plasters. If Mrs May is constrained by her small majority, she is also immeasurably helped by the lack of credible opposition. Her party retain a significant poll lead on almost every issue apart from the NHS, on which Labour have a slim lead. In polls asking the public what issues they are concerned about, leaving the EU has been at the top of the agenda since June. But Joe Twyman of YouGov explains that this isn't quite what it seems. He said: ""The impact Brexit has on all those issues - from the economy to health and immigration - means that they're all judged through that prism now. If promises aren't delivered on health or immigration, the Tories could still take a big hit in the polls."" The scale of the Brexit challenge is setting in. Hundreds of sittings of Parliament are expected to be devoted to arranging 40 years of EU legislation onto our statute books. Whitehall must set up a new immigration system, repatriate business regulation, farming subsidies, environmental protections and all manner of other things. There's the prospect of deadlock with the Remainers in Parliament as well as difficulties with Brussels. Mrs May's legacy won't be her domestic reforms, but her Brexit success will be judged on whether voters feel that life is really getting better."
2017-04-01,The Co-op Group will next week write off the value of its shareholding in the bank that bears its name – incurring a £140m hit that will plunge the mutual into an overall statutory loss for 2016.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/co-op-group-plunges-to-2016-loss-as-bank-stake-is-written-off-10820360,"Sky News has learnt that Co-op Group directors and their advisers will opt to reduce the value of its 20% stake in the Co-operative Bank to zero, reflecting mounting uncertainty about the troubled lender's future. The decision, which sources said reflected a conservative approach to accounting by the Co-op Group board, reinforces a widely held belief in the City that the bank's shares may now be worthless. The development will emerge in the group's annual results on Thursday, which will show a statutory loss because of the Bank writedown but report a healthy operating profit, according to insiders. It will come in an important week for the bank, six weeks after it was formally put up for sale. Potential bidders have been asked to submit initial expressions of interest by 4 April. While Virgin Money and CYBG, the owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank networks, are expected to register proposals, there remain serious doubts about whether any party will seek to acquire the Co-op Bank in its entirety. Thursday's results will mark the third consecutive reporting period at which the Co-op Group has slashed the value of its bank shareholding, which was reduced to 20% in 2013 when a group of hedge funds injected funds into it to save it from collapse. At its half-year results in September, the group said it would reduce the value of its holding by 25% to £140m, which it said was ""consistent with falls in bank valuations generally"". The Co-op's 2016 results are expected to paint an otherwise-rosy picture of the state of Britain's most prominent mutual. A revamped membership scheme has attracted more than 600,000 new members since last autumn - ahead of executives' targets. Its food retailing business is performing strongly, with 18 consecutive quarters of outperformance of the wider grocery market. The Co-op's chief executive, Richard Pennycook, has just handed over the reins of the Group to Steve Murrells, who had run the food operations since 2012. Mr Pennycook, who was dubbed the Co-op's ""saviour"" by colleagues, announced in January that he would step down, almost a year after he asked fellow directors to sanction a big pay cut to reflect the mutual's transition from crisis to recovery. The Co-op, which declined to comment on the bank stake writedown, says it is now moving from a ""rebuild"" phase to ""renewal"", marking an appropriate time for a new leader to take over. However, next week's loss will serve as a potent reminder of the lingering curse of its shareholding in the Co-op Bank, which has been hit by a string of legacy issues and the problem of ultra-low interest rates. Mr Pennycook is remaining as an adviser to the mutual on the future of its bank stake. In a statement last month, the bank said it had been contacted by ""a number of credible strategic and financial parties"". It added that it would ""proceed to a second phase of the sale process where selected parties will be provided with additional information in order to continue their due diligence with a view to making an offer for all of the issued ordinary share capital of the Bank"". Doubts over bidders' intentions have also forced the bank to consider a plan B, which involves ""discussions with existing equity and debt security holders as well as new potential investors on a capital raise alternative to the sale process"". The Bank of England and the Prudential Regulation Authority are taking a close interest in the process, with the former having engaged Deutsche Bank to advise it, according to The Sunday Times. The Co-op Bank's huge pension liabilities are among the major obstacles to a sale. Senior Co-op Bank bonds have been trading at little more than 80p in the pound in recent weeks, underlining investors' pessimism that a £400m repayment due in September will be made. The lender announced an annual loss last month £477m, taking its total losses since its rescue in 2013 by a group of American hedge funds to well over £2.5bn. If new capital is not forthcoming, regulators would have little choice but to put the Co-op Bank into a resolution process, which would involve an orderly wind-down of the company's operations. At that point, the likes of Nationwide could be asked to step forward to take on some or all of the Co-op Bank's four million customers. A number of other parties, including OneSavings Bank and Santander UK, are said to be more interested in acquiring individual loan portfolios from the Co-op Bank. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was drafted in last year to help the Co-op Bank find buyers for a £350m portfolio of commercial real estate loans. The Co-op Bank has been continuing to grapple with some of the issues that took it to the brink of collapse in 2013, although its customer base has been remarkably resilient during its period of turmoil. The Co-op Bank's balance sheet ballooned following a disastrous merger with the Britannia Building Society, and then ran into trouble when it tried to buy more than 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. Last summer, the mutual exercised its right to appoint a director to the board of the bank for the first time, raising the prospect of it playing a significant role in the resolution of the lender's future. The Co-op Bank's former chairman, Paul Flowers, brought it into disrepute when his drug-taking and sexual proclivities were exposed by a tabloid newspaper, while his financial competence was questioned by MPs."
2017-04-01,"Cabinet ministers secretly agreed that Britain should put security on the table in Brexit talks, despite official Government denials, it is reported.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170401211041/http://news.sky.com/story/security-on-the-table-during-brexit-talks-10821808,"There was ""panic"" from EU leaders about the impact the UK's exit would have on security in the face of ""increased Russian aggression"", according to The Sunday Telegraph. The paper claims leaked minutes of a Brexit Cabinet committee meeting on 7 March show ministers identified the UK's ""very strong hand"" on defence as a key advantage in negotiations. The disclosure comes after Boris Johnson attempted to play down a row triggered by Theresa May in her Article 50 letter to the European Council president, Donald Tusk, by claiming Britain's support for EU security was ""unconditional"". In her letter, which sparked a furious backlash in the EU, the Prime Minister said failure to reach a Brexit deal on trade ""would mean our co-operation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened"". But in an interview with France's Le Figaro, asked whether Britain was trying to use security cooperation as a bargaining chip to secure an EU trade deal, Mr Johnson said: ""No, not at all."" He added: ""We consider the historic contribution of the UK to the security and stability of Europe as unconditional. ""We will maintain this contribution, which benefits all of Europe and the world. It's in our interest and in the interest of others, and we hope this will be one of the planks of our deep and special partnership (with the EU)."" But according to The Sunday Telegraph, ministers at the 7 March meeting said security would be a ""defining"" issue for the EU and that Britain should not ""underplay"" its hand as it seeks to secure a favourable free trade deal. The paper claims Cabinet ministers Sir Michael Fallon, David Davis, Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson are all understood to have spoken up about the importance of British security to the EU ahead of talks. A source familiar with the discussions told the paper: ""While there were nuances, I think the absolute view around the table was we are in a very strong position and the Europeans know it. ""We go into these negotiations with security and defence being a big thing in our corner."" A Government source has declined to comment on the leak, but said that Britain wants ""a deep and special partnership with the EU covering all aspects including security"". The PM faced allegations of ""blackmail"" and ""threats"" by EU figures after her Article 50 Brexit letter mentioned security 11 times across six pages. On the same day Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, said in a Sky News interview: ""If we left Europol, then we would take our information with us."" Number 10 has insisted no ""threat"" was intended and that the UK Government was not explicitly linking the country's help on security with a trade deal. However, The Sunday Telegraph claims to have obtained an official account of the 7 March meeting, at which a paper on Britain's defence and security drawn up by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office is said to have been submitted for discussion. According to the paper, it both spelled out the country's existing EU security links and reported back what EU leaders were thinking on the topic, including rising concerns over Russian aggression. Mr Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, led discussions by saying that Britain had a ""strong hand"" at the negotiating table when it came to security, the paper reports. He stressed that ""we should not be a demandeur"" in negotiations when it came to security - the French word for someone who makes demands - but be aware of the tactical advantage. Sir Michael, the Defence Secretary, is understood to have said: ""Insecurity in Europe is at its highest since the Cold War. There is increased Russian aggression. ""The EU needs our capabilities,"" he is recorded as adding, before saying that the UK had ""high cards"" to play at the negotiating table on security. Mr Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is noted as saying: ""I agree that Britain has high cards and a very strong hand [on security]. ""The UK is in a strong position and there is a degree of panic within Europe over defence policy and cooperation."" He is said to have added that the UK should not ""underplay"" its hand. Mr Hammond, the Chancellor, said that the EU would not offer an economic relationship which deterred Britain from co-operating on defence. He added the UK should make that ""clear"" during talks. The Prime Minister is said to have attended the meeting and summed up at the end. She is understood to have said that defence and security were a ""defining issue for the EU"" and that the UK is in a ""strong position"". Those familiar with the talks said there was no mention of ""threatening"" the EU but an acceptance the UK could use its strong position during negotiations. A Government source told The Sunday Telegraph: ""We do not comment on Cabinet Committee leaks, however we have been clear that we want a deep and special partnership with the EU covering all aspects including security. ""Our position is simply a statement of fact - if we leave with no agreement in place, the arrangements we currently have will lapse. We are not bargaining security with anyone - we want to maintain the degree of cooperation on these matters that we have currently."""

Citizan - which trains volunteers to recognise surface archaeology in the area - had chosen the beach after a Bronze Age trackway was discovered in the same area last month. Oliver Hutchinson, 33, an archaeologist for the group, told Sky News the discovery was ""a chance find"". When the archaeologists dug down around the tip, they discovered the 6ft (1.8m) tusk hidden in the beach, around 1,000m from the shore. Using a phone app, the team logged its location but had to move on with their field trip before the tide came in.

 Volunteers returned on Friday morning, taking around 60 photos to create a 3D image using photogrammetry - the science of making measurements from photos. Mr Hutchinson said: ""The good thing about being able to make a 3D model of the tusk, is that using this technology we can capture and share our find with other experts."" They also took small samples of the tusk itself, and from the ground around and below it, in order to date the find, which could be 14,000 years old. ""We can't actually pick up the tusk as it's laminated and flaking apart,"" said Mr Hutchinson. ""It has to stay in situ and slowly erode away. It's just the nature of it - many things have gone the way of the dodo."" Most mammoths died out 10,000 years ago, with a tiny population enduring on isolated Wrangel Island - off the northern coast of eastern Siberia - until 1650 BC. While it is widely believed they were driven to extinction by humans, scientists have also found evidence that rising temperatures may have melted the mammoths' habitat, causing them to die out. US scientists recently said they were just two years away from creating a hybrid woolly mammoth embryo using DNA from specimens found frozen in ice."

The former diplomat said the conversation took place by phone around a month into the operation. In a new biography of the heir to the throne, serialised by the Daily Mail, Mr Farish said: ""Prince Charles asked me if it would be possible to stop the invasion to honour Ramadan, and if I could convey that request to President Bush."" It is claimed when Prince Charles was told that it would be difficult he replied: ""But Americans can do anything!"" According to the account, when the envoy asked: ""Sir, are you really serious?"", Charles replied: ""Yes I am.""

Mr Farish,78, was US ambassador to the UK between 2001 and 2004 and appeared alongside George Bush senior, Tony Blair and the Queen at a service to remember the victims of the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York. Prince Charles also attended the service around seven weeks after the Afghan invasion began on 7 October, 2001. Ramadan began on 16 November 16 and ended on 17 December. The claims emerged as Prince Charles was due to honour First World War dead during a visit to Italy, while the Duchess of Cornwall visits a project supporting vulnerable people, based in a former mafia villa.

2017-04-02,"The organisation representing the UK's meat industry says it is concerned it is ""only a matter of time"" before someone is hurt because of violent protests by animal rights groups.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170402153829/http://news.sky.com/story/fears-over-tactics-used-by-vegan-activists-at-abbatoirs-and-restaurants-10820168,"The British Meat Processors Association has told Sky News there have been a number of instances of unlawful behaviour during co-ordinated protests which have included abusive and intimidating behaviour towards employees, contractors and hauliers as well as trespassing on private property. Its comments relate to the SAVE organisation - an animal rights group which started in the US but now has more than 20 branches in the UK. In November 2016 the East London Chicken SAVE group blocked a lorry carrying crates of chickens to an abattoir. The protest became heated with abuse shouted at workers. Police were called but no one was arrested. On its website, SAVE says it is a ""love-based non-violent group"" and urges its members to refrain from any ""loud or threatening behaviour"". The vast majority of SAVE vigils - which are held as animals are driven into abattoirs - are peaceful. But the BMPA says it is concerned about the number of activists not adhering to the group's guidelines. It said: ""We respect the rights of the protesters to mount vigils and that they have strong views. In return we expect them to be peaceful and civilised in their approach to vigils at our members' sites. ""Our members do have concerns that it is only a matter of time before someone is hurt as a result of this behaviour and we continue to work closely with local police forces in order to ensure everyone's safety."" Kirsty Henderson from PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) told Sky News the violent protests are rare. ""The SAVE movement is a mainstream movement made up of people around the world. They hold candlelit vigils outside slaughterhouses and give the animals who are destined to have their throats cut in just a few minutes their last semblance of life, some comfort. It is really a movement based on no violence."" Chrissy Dean is an animal rights activist from SAVE's Manchester group. At a peaceful protest, she told Sky News why she attends the vigils moments before the animals are killed. ""I just love animals and I just think that everything that is living has a right to live. Those pigs don't want to die. I've seen them just run around fields and be free. I'm a mother and they are babies. They just don't deserve to be treated in the way they are treated."" The meat industry says it will continue to work with police to ensure the safety of those it represents."
2017-04-02,A mother and father trying to raise £1.2m to fund treatment for their unwell baby son have reached their target.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170402153829/http://news.sky.com/story/charlie-gard-parents-of-unwell-baby-reach-16312m-target-to-pay-for-us-treatment-10822181,"Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have told the couple they believe it is time to stop life-support treatment to Charlie Gard who is almost eight months old. Charlie suffers from a rare genetic condition and medics say he should be moved to a palliative care regime. His condition, which has no cure, is caused by a disruption in the mitochondria that provides energy to his muscles, kidneys and brain and even leaves him unable to cry. But the little boy's parents, postman Chris Gard and Connie Yates, want to be allowed to take Charlie to a hospital in America where they have found a doctor who can provide ground-breaking treatment. A judge is due to analyse medical evidence at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London on Monday before deciding what is in Charlie's best interests. The couple, from Bedfont, west London, who are both in their early 30s, launched an appeal on the GoFundMe website and said they needed to raise £1.2m to pay for the treatment. Almost 80,000 people have pledged money and the target has been exceeded. The couple wrote on the GoFundMe page: ""We just can't let our baby die when there is something that might help him! ""We won't give up on him because he has a rare disease. He deserves a chance and he deserves a life as much as anyone else. ""We understand that rare diseases don't get enough funding for research but why should that be a reason for a child to die? He's here now and this could help our baby."" The money raised so far includes £40,000 from a couple in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Housewife Helen Barnes watched Charlie's parents discussing his condition on TV and immediately pledged £20,000 from her life savings. When her husband came home from work and she told him what she had done, he agreed to donate another £20,000. Mother-of-two Mrs Barnes, 45, told the Daily Mail: ""I was moved to tears when I saw Connie and Chris being interviewed. ""I couldn't believe the terrible situation they've found themselves in. ""It seems wrong that their child isn't being given the chance of life when there is something that could help him. ""I am a spontaneous person and immediately it felt right to give them this money. ""As a mother, you will do anything you can for your child and I just wanted to help them."" Celebrities Michelle Keegan, Katie Price and Charlotte Crosby have also been urging the public to dig deep after hearing about his condition."

""Well he's imprisoned, that would be a little difficult"", she said. She went on: ""Let's see what happens when he's free, but I spend probably more time with him than with any other man, socially, which is very odd. ""He's very sexy."" Mr Assange sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012, fearing he would be deported to Sweden to answer allegations of sexual assault. He claims he is innocent. Mr Assange and Anderson are believed to have met for the first time last year, when she visited him at the embassy. Rumours of a possible romance began when she posted on her blog: ""My relationship with Julian - it's no secret. ""He is one of my favorite people - and he might be the most famous, most politicized refugee of our time. Famous for being persecuted. Famous for being persecuted is not a position of power but a position of vulnerability,"" she wrote. ""Julian is trying to free the world by educating it. It is a romantic struggle - I love him for this - He is the strongest person I know - but, living as he is, is very unhealthy, demeaning and inhumane."" Anderson, who gained fame as the star of the hit TV show Baywatch in the 1990s, has more recently focused her attention on humanitarian work and activism."

The four men and two women, aged either 20 or 24, were arrested on Saturday evening at several addresses in Croydon and taken into custody at a police station. Detectives are continuing to appeal for information and witnesses to the attack, which is being treated as a suspected hate crime. The 17-year-old asylum seeker, a Kurdish Iranian, was waiting at a bus stop with two friends at about 11.40pm on Friday when they were approached by a group of eight people. After discovering he was an asylum seeker, they chased him and launched a ""savage"" attack including ""repeated blows to the head"", police said. Someone who lives in Shrublands Avenue, where the attack happened, said: ""There were more than eight people. There was a massive group coming up from The Goat pub. ""You couldn't see who was hitting who. ""There was one person, the one who ended up in hospital, he was getting absolutely beaten up - kicked, mostly in the facial area. He was getting kicked and punched by everyone."" The resident added: ""There was a group of roughly 10 people that was kicking and punching him, and the rest, another 10 or 20, were all just around watching. ""Then when they heard sirens they started to go. People that were there, witnesses, because they couldn't do anything against a group of 30 people, they had to wait until they moved off and that's when they managed to help him. ""That's eventually when the ambulance and police (arrived), and that was it."" The teenager remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition with a fractured skull, a blood clot on his brain and facial injuries. His two friends escaped with minor injuries. DS Kris Blamires, from Croydon CID, said: ""A number of people came to the aid of the victim as he lay unconscious and injured following the assault. ""The suspects are believed to have made off in the direction of the Goat Pub, Broom Road following the attack. ""I would encourage all those who came to his aid and those in the immediate area who witnessed the attack or saw the males leave the scene to get in touch. ""All communities stand together against hate and we would ask anyone with any information to come forward immediately."" The local community has been left shocked by the ferocity of the attack, and extra officers have been out and about to try to reassure people. Croydon Central MP and Conservative minister Gavin Barwell described the attackers as ""scum"". ""I think most people in Croydon will be as appalled as I am that what appears to have happened is a young man who came to this country seeking sanctuary has apparently been targeted because of his ethnic background,"" he said. ""It's an appalling crime and I hope the people responsible are caught quickly and receive the full force of British justice."" He said Croydon generally had ""very good relations between people of different backgrounds"". ""This is completely out of character but that is no comfort to the individual who is fighting for his life now,"" he added. :: Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111."

Spain has a long-standing territorial claim on Gibraltar, which has been held by the UK since 1713 and has the status of a British overseas territory. Draft Brexit negotiating guidelines, sent out on Friday, contained a clause suggesting Spain will be able to veto any future trade deal between the EU and the UK. Mrs May, who has been criticised for not mentioning the territory in her Brexit letter to the EU, spoke to Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo to reassure him and the people of Gibraltar over their status. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May ""reiterated our long-standing position that the UK remains steadfastly committed to our support for Gibraltar, its people and its economy"". ""The Prime Minister said we will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes, nor will we ever enter into a process of sovereignty negotiations with which Gibraltar is not content. ""The Prime Minister said we remain absolutely dedicated to working with Gibraltar for the best possible outcome on Brexit and will continue to involve them fully in the process."" The reassurance from Number 10 came as former Conservative leader Lord Howard said the PM would show the same resolve to defend the Rock as Margaret Thatcher did over the Falklands. He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show: ""I think there's no question whatever that our Gibraltar will stand by Gibraltar. ""Thirty-five-years-ago this week, another woman prime minister sent a task force half way across the world to defend the freedom of another small group of British people against another Spanish-speaking country. ""I'm absolutely certain that our current Prime Minister will show the same resolve in standing by the people of Gibraltar."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said it was ""unbelievable"" that within a week of triggering Article 50 ""there are Conservatives already discussing potential wars with our European neighbours"". He said: ""Brexiteers have gone from cheering to sabre-rattling ... it is absolutely ludicrous."" Mr Picardo, who has hit out at the threat of a Spanish veto on the Rock's future, said he was ""sure the UK will be batting for Gibraltar"". He told the Andrew Marr Show: ""The United Kingdom goes to war over the principle of consent around the world, and the people of Gibraltar have expressed their views as to what they think the sovereignty of Gibraltar should be democratically and freely."" Sky's Political Correspondent Lewis Goodall said: ""In her latter years as Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher used to tell a story. ""For visitors lucky enough to receive a personal tour from the PM around Chequers, she pointed out a certain desk and uttered what must have seemed rather ominous words: 'That is the chair I sat in when I gave the order to sink the Belgrano'. ""Perhaps that's the sort of ""resolve"" Michael Howard had in mind when he spoke this morning. ""Either way it's hardly going to do much to ameliorate Anglo-Spanish relations, which have had a rough week. ""When speaking of 'another Spanish-speaking nation', I doubt very much the Spanish government would much appreciate the comparison with Argentina in 1982, run by a military junta. ""Whatever the Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy might be, General Galtieri he ain't. ""The comments aren't likely to make the Gibraltar tussle any better. Nor are the Spanish Foreign Minister's in El Pais today where he confirmed that Spain would not veto an independent Scotland's entry into the EU. ""The negotiations haven't even begun yet. And they've already been waylaid by a tiny rock on the Mediterranean. Not the best start."""

Asked if he was prepared to do the same, Mr Adams replied: ""Yes, I have said and Martin and I said this together and we've said it quite a few times, that we would both do our best and we would also encourage other Republicans to come forward if there was a satisfactory arrangement put in place and that's my commitment. ""Martin's not here, but that's still my commitment."" Mr Adams denied that his party was focused only on the actions of British soldiers during the conflict. ""Our position has been for an international, independent truth commission that everybody can make use of but we compromised on this issue,"" he said. ""I believe that victims of the IRA, or at least their relatives, have the right to truth and I believe that those who are victims of British Army violence or state violence also have the right to truth and the British government is holding that back."" He said power-sharing had collapsed because Unionists had reneged on commitments, adding: ""Martin McGuinness was big and strong and formidable enough to carry that to a certain degree for the rest of us. ""Martin's gone so even if we were able to cobble together something tomorrow, it wouldn't last. I want it to be sustainable."" He said the current negotiations were the first since 1972 that he had been without Mr McGuinness. On Brexit, he claimed the only way to avoid a hard border was for Northern Ireland to have designated status within the EU and denied that would be a united Ireland by the back door. Mr Adams said his party was exploring the option of requesting a referendum on Irish unity but didn't want to ""exploit the consequences of Brexit"". ""The type of Ireland we want is one in which Unionism, decent Unionists, are content,"" he said. ""As someone who was born into a state that didn't want me, I don't want a new Ireland to be anything other than a harmonious fraternity of all the people who live on this island."" :: Watch the full interview on Sophy Ridge on Sunday at 10am on Sky News"

The 38-year-old charity worker was arrested at Tehran Airport on 3 April last year as she attempted to return to the UK following a holiday with her two-year-old daughter. She was sentenced to five years in prison by an Iranian court on ""secret charges"" and lost an appeal against her sentence but maintains her innocence. Her daughter remains in Iran with family after authorities seized her passport. Iran does not recognise dual nationalities, and those detained cannot receive consular assistance. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard Ratcliffe said it had been a ""long year of separation, a year of our lives interrupted"". He has branded her sentence as ""a punishment without a crime"" and previously said she was struggling most with being separated from her daughter and had suffered hair and weight loss as a result of her ordeal. The Free Nazanin Campaign said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had still not been shown her charge sheet following January's appeal or what she has been convicted of. Supporters tied yellow ribbons to a tree in the park along with quotes from inmates at Evin prison in Iran, where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being held, describing what they would do with one day of freedom. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's wish reads to her husband: ""My fondest dream has always been to arrive at our home, you ask me if I want to have a cup of tea, then make me one. ""I just sit back and watch you two play. This is the image I had most when in solitary confinement. ""How I wish I could watch you both dance in the middle of our sitting room to the Michael Jackson music - like when Gabriella was only tiny."" She also told of how she would like to ""put a huge paper on the wall"" and ""draw a world in which there are no prisons, walls or fences - and let Gabriella do the colouring"". A FCO spokeswoman said: ""We are deeply concerned that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence has been confirmed following an unsuccessful appeal while Iran continues to refuse the UK consular access to her. ""We continue to raise our strong concerns about all dual British/Iranian prisoners in Iran, including Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, at the highest levels in both London and Tehran. ""The UK's Minister for the Middle East, Tobias Ellwood, has spoken to his Iranian opposite number, and the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have both previously raised this case with their counterparts. ""We have been supporting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family since we were first made aware of her arrest. Mr Ellwood has met her husband in London and her family in Tehran to assure them that we will continue to do all we can for her. ""We are continuing to press the Iranians for consular access and for due process to be followed, and are ready to help get her daughter back safely to the UK if requested."""

Scotland Yard said marine experts examined the shell and it was removed by specialist officers on Sunday morning. Chief Inspector Tracy Stephenson said: ""I'm very happy to update that the ordnance has now been safely removed and the race will be going ahead as planned. ""We have been working very closely with the organisers of the boat race to plan this event, which is eagerly awaited by spectators and supporters alike."" Thousands of people lined the banks of the Thames to watch the 163rd edition of the Boat Race between the two universities. The men's event starts at 5.35pm, while the women's race - in its 72nd year - was won by Cambridge. A spokeswoman for the event said the race was only ever called off during the two world wars."
2017-04-02,Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth has questioned the legality of government plans that will see operation waiting times increase.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170402153829/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-questions-legality-of-scrapping-nhs-18-week-waiting-time-target-10822139,"He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show he has written to Jeremy Hunt asking him to publish what legal advice he may have on the scrapping of the maximum 18-week waiting time for non-urgent consultant-led treatments. In his letter he also demands to know whether the Health Secretary plans to legislate to change the NHS constitution. The NHS target is for 92% of patients to be treated within 18 weeks of referral but this has not been met since February 2016. Mr Ashworth said the 18-week waiting time was ""an absolute right for patients"" which was ""enshrined in the NHS constitution"". The Labour frontbencher said he was worried the move to scrap the target could be challenged in the courts. He said: ""Effectively what you are seeing now bit-by-bit, step-by-step, is the NHS being pushed back to the bad old days. ""It is a direct consequence of the very severe Tory under-funding that has been imposed on the NHS by Theresa May's Government. ""My worry about the dropping of this 18-week target is, it isn't a promise by politicians, or a promise by NHS bosses. ""It's actually enshrined in the NHS constitution. Parliament legislated for that. ""It is an absolute right for patients to be seen within 18 weeks, so I am very worried that this could be challenged in the courts, that the constitution is being breached. ""I'm writing to Jeremy Hunt asking him to publish what legal advice he may have on this, asking him whether he is going to come to Parliament and legislate to change the NHS constitution. ""If he's not, he's breaking that constitution, he's breaking the rules and then he has to go to the Chancellor and ask for the funding so that we can get the NHS that we expect."" Mr Ashworth added: ""It is absolutely disgraceful that pensioners, elderly people, are going to be waiting longer for their hip replacement, knee replacement, cataract replacement - operations of that order. ""What is going on in the NHS really is a crisis and Theresa May's got to get a grip."" Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, revealed the blueprint for how the service will cope with huge clinical and financial pressures over the next two years, earlier this week. He conceded measures to improve A&E services and mental health care involved a ""trade-off"" that will see some waiting times increase, ""hundreds of thousands"" of patients no longer referred to hospital consultants, and new drugs not automatically prescribed. The plans also include 150 new urgent treatment centres as an alternative to A&E, and extending GP services in an attempt to vacate up to 3,000 hospital beds. Sky News has contacted the Department of Health for a comment."
2017-04-02,"Nine months on from referendum result, the ball is rolling on Brexit and the daunting workload involved is becoming clearer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170402153829/http://news.sky.com/story/is-there-anything-beyond-brexit-10819710,"But while Theresa May will be remembered as the Prime Minister who steered Britain out of the European Union, is there room for anything else? It's an active debate at the heart of Government. The reasons are obvious. Today's newspapers lead on the acute pressures on social care, with a damning report from MPs showing funding is in freefall. Elderly people who pay their own way (because they have assets of more than £23,250) are being charged even more to cover the increasing toll of those whose care is covered by the state. Meanwhile, the NHS - which featured heavily in the Leave campaign - has axed its 18-week limit for operations. The four-hour A&E target limps on, but the last time it was met was the summer of 2015. In one horrifyingly case, Kayden Urmston-Bancroft, aged 20 months, died after his operation was cancelled for three days running. Such a story would once have had a Government on the ropes. Schools funding is also on the political agenda in a way it hasn't been for years, with parents asked to buy their own textbooks as head teachers grapple with funding gaps. For patients awaiting operations, parents worried about school places and the legions of young people working but with no hope of buying a home, there are more immediate concerns than Brexit over the next two years. Theresa May is acutely aware of all this. She declared in her party conference speech in October that the referendum vote was ""not just a vote to withdraw from the EU, it was about something broader"". ""It was about a sense deep, profound and let's face it often justified - that many people have today that the world works well for a privileged few, but not for them."" The Queen's speech on 17 May is a chance, Tory MPs say, to put her sentiment - about broken markets, burning injustices and building infrastructure - into action. But it will be dominated by Brexit-related bills. ""There will be some domestic stuff, but all likelihood it will be Brexit with bells on"", a senior Conservative tells me. A relatively quiet group of MPs and ministers believe making the most of Brexit means turbo-charging economic reforms now to meet the need of the future - on skills, apprenticeships and rebalancing the economy away from London and the financial services sector. ""We need to prepare for global Britain now, or we're just promising jam tomorrow. But there's real debate about whether the Government has the bandwidth for it"", says one figure familiar with discussions in Number 10. Education and skills and a bill about workplace practices are expected to feature in the speech, but they won't be the headlines. Deep thinking about public services is under way, but in the medium term there are only sticking plasters. If Mrs May is constrained by her small majority, she is also immeasurably helped by the lack of credible opposition. Her party retain a significant poll lead on almost every issue apart from the NHS, on which Labour have a slim lead. In polls asking the public what issues they are concerned about, leaving the EU has been at the top of the agenda since June. But Joe Twyman of YouGov explains that this isn't quite what it seems. He said: ""The impact Brexit has on all those issues - from the economy to health and immigration - means that they're all judged through that prism now. If promises aren't delivered on health or immigration, the Tories could still take a big hit in the polls."" The scale of the Brexit challenge is setting in. Hundreds of sittings of Parliament are expected to be devoted to arranging 40 years of EU legislation onto our statute books. Whitehall must set up a new immigration system, repatriate business regulation, farming subsidies, environmental protections and all manner of other things. There's the prospect of deadlock with the Remainers in Parliament as well as difficulties with Brussels. Mrs May's legacy won't be her domestic reforms, but her Brexit success will be judged on whether voters feel that life is really getting better."

An FCO spokeswoman said Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke to Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, son of the Saudi king and the country's defence minister, on Saturday. ""They discussed bilateral relations, regional issues and the humanitarian situation in Yemen,"" the spokeswoman said. ""The Foreign Secretary expressed his regret at the disturbance to Saudi Major General Assiri's visit to London on Thursday."" Saudi state media said that Britain had apologised. :: UK-made cluster bombs used in Yemen war, says Defence Secretary Gen Assiri had said after the incident that he had been ""subject to aggression"" by protesters critical of Riyadh's operations in Yemen. Footage on Twitter showed anti-war activist Sam Walton approaching Gen Assiri last week, putting his hand on the general's shoulder and announcing he was placing him under citizen's arrest, before being pushed aside by the official's security detail. As the general, shielded by his bodyguards, entered a building, another protester threw the egg. Video then showed Gen Assiri turning around and making a rude gesture towards the activist.

2017-04-02,The first day after the trigger is pulled and already there is returning fire. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170402153829/http://news.sky.com/story/eu-fires-back-after-theresa-may-pulls-brexit-trigger-10818385,"The British Government has received salvos from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande over how the negotiations should be conducted. Both have rejected one of Theresa May's key demands, which is to settle the terms of the UK's departure at the same time as agreeing future trading arrangements. It's an unsettling start to the process and could lead to delay. First it was Mrs Merkel, speaking in Berlin yesterday. She said: ""The negotiations must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship."" Trade could only be discussed afterwards. Then this morning Mr Hollande told the PM during a phone conversation that he also thought the terms of withdrawal should come first. Settle that, then discuss future trading deals. This doesn't work for the UK. It's clear the PM doesn't want to pay up her divorce bill without knowing how much access she will have to the kids. But who is right on this and who is likely to get their way? So far the Government hasn't budged. The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said this morning on Sky News: ""We've got to debate this"" as he defended the Government's view that talks over the UK's departure should run in parallel with future trade negotiations."" He insists that Mrs Merkel doesn't have the final word, saying: ""It's a negotiation and we want to do it in a certain way."" The Brexit Secretary believes it is the Commission rather than the member states that has been pushing to complete the departure bill first and the trade deal second. But he adds: ""Article 50 says the departure should be negotiated taking into account the ongoing deal."" ""It makes it pretty plain they've got to be done together. ""We think that's a smart way to do it, because everybody then can make a judgement as to what's a good outcome for everybody - what the balance of outcomes are."" He is right that this is specified in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. It states that if a country chooses to leave, ""the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union"". This is open to interpretation, however. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the European Parliament's Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, told Adam Boulton's All Out Politics on Sky News: ""The treaty is very clear about this. ""In Article 50 it's stipulated that first of all you do the withdrawal agreement in the light of your future relationship between the UK and the EU."" So Mrs Merkel's view seems to have growing support, whereas this morning, when asked by Sky News, the PM's spokesman was unwilling or unable to name any leaders who supported Mrs May on this. In some ways, Mrs Merkel's position on dismissing the idea of parallel negotiations is strengthened by Mrs May's approach to Brexit. In her Lancaster House speech in January, the PM was explicit that the UK wanted a clean break from the EU, saying she did ""not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave"". It is therefore quite easy for the Europeans to offer the UK the clean break it wants - settling assets and liabilities, paying off the divorce bill and then saying only afterwards we should look at the future trading relationship. If the UK had begun with an approach that it might want to retain some aspects of EU membership, this would have made it much more difficult to split the negotiations into two parts. It could however argue that there will still be aspects of shared interests, such as ongoing investment in scientific research, and that these things need to be settled and agreed upon before the divorce bill can be known. When Sky News asked Number 10 whether the divorce bill was a negotiating chip for a possible future trading deal with the EU, the PM's spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment on negotiation strategy. It seems the negotiation over the negotiation could drag on and certainly it is unlikely to be settled until after the Council of Europe meets on 29 April. Here ministers will decide the guidelines for negotiations. Mr Davis says ""that's the point at which we should start saying 'OK, we agree here, we disagree there'"". But it's a worry that in the first battle of this negotiation, the EU's biggest players are so openly opposed to the UK's planned approach."

Both candidates have spoken during the campaign of how they would deal with Mr Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Mr Lasso has said if he is elected he will evict the WikiLeaks founder within 30 days of taking office. Mr Moreno, who is aligned with outgoing President Rafael Correa and was hand-picked by him, has said he would let Mr Assange stay in the embassy. Mr Assange sought asylum in the embassy in 2012, fearing he would be deported to Sweden to answer allegations of sexual assault. He says he is innocent, and fears that from Sweden he might be extradited to the United States, where he is wanted on espionage charges. The election is expected to be tight. Mr Moreno is seen as continuing Mr Correa's ""Citizens' Revolution"" while Mr Lasso is promising to deliver a jolt to the nation's beleaguered economy. The country is heavily dependent on oil and its economy is suffering a downturn as oil prices remain low. It is expected to shrink by 2.7% this year. Surveys show a majority of citizens are keen for change after 10 years of Mr Correa's iron-fisted rule. But in the final weeks of the race Mr Moreno has inched ahead amid an aggressive campaign to cast his rival as a wealthy, out-of-touch politician. A victory by Mr Lasso would further tilt Latin America toward the right following a series of conservative election victories. The vote is a run-off between the two top candidates. In the first round of balloting, held on 19 February, Mr Moreno fell just short of the required percentage of votes to avoid a runoff election against Mr Lasso. The process was marred by accusations of fraud from both sides and angry protests, as the vote count dragged on for several days before the official results were announced."
2017-04-02,A new taskforce of counter-terrorism experts is being launched on Monday to tackle the threat of radicalisation in prisons.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170402153829/http://news.sky.com/story/new-taskforce-to-tackle-poisonous-extremism-in-prisons-10821980,"The 100-strong team will examine intelligence from across England and Wales as part of government plans to tackle ""poisonous"" extremism behind bars. Jails will be advised on how to deal with specific threats, and the unit will help train prison workers on effective ways to deter offenders from being lured into extremism. It is hoped the specialist team will also help prisons manage dangerous and high-profile extremist prisoners. Figures suggest that more than 1,000 prisoners are identified as extremist or vulnerable to extremism at any one time - and the taskforce is going to target all forms of extremism, including far-right ideologies. Prisons minister Sam Gyimah said: ""This new team will lead this strand of important work to help combat and defeat terrorist threats posed by offenders in the prison estate and in the community. ""By countering the poisonous and repugnant activities of extremists, we will help ensure the safe running of our prisons and keep the public safe."" The new unit follows a Government-ordered review last year which concluded that Islamist extremism is a growing problem within jails. That assessment uncovered evidence of offenders expressing support for Islamic State, and ""charismatic"" prisoners acting as ""self-styled emirs"" to radicalise fellow inmates. Following the inquiry, the Government announced plans to separate dangerous extremists from the rest of the prison population. The Ministry of Justice says the new taskforce follows other measures designed to address extremism - including orders for prison governors to ban extremist literature and remove anyone from communal worship who promotes anti-British beliefs or other dangerous views. Hanif Qadir, a former Taliban fighter who runs a foundation which works to prevent radicalisation, told Sky News he welcomes the proposals as radicalisation has reached ""unprecedented levels"" in the nation's jails. He said: ""It's since the inception of Islamic State and the calling to jihad by IS. Over the last three to four years, the growth of violent extremism within prisons has been on an unimaginable scale. ""At the moment, the problem in our prisons is very, very concerning and we need to deal with it rapidly."""

Jumaili was killed with other Islamic State commanders in a strike carried out by the Iraqi air force in the region of al-Qaim, near the border with Syria, the channel said, citing Iraqi military intelligence. Jumaili, who had been an intelligence officer under Saddam Hussein, was described in the TV report as Islamic State's ""second-in-command"" and ""war minister"". The US-led coalition against Islamic State said it was unable to provide confirmation at present. Iraqi forces, backed by a US-led coalition, have been battling to retake the city of Mosul, Islamic State's stronghold in Iraq and the city where Baghdadi declared a caliphate nearly three years ago. Tens of thousands of refugees have been fleeing the city to escape the fighting, and IS has been using civilians as bait for coalition air strikes to create a public outcry. Since the push began in February, it is estimated the number of IS fighters has been halved to fewer than 1,000. This has led to the jihadists using more extreme tactics to protect themselves and the few remaining areas under their control. It is not clear whether Baghdadi is still in Mosul, but US and Iraqi officials believe he has left operational commanders behind with diehard followers to fight the battle of Mosul and is now hiding out in the desert. A separate battle is being prepared in Syria to drive Islamic State from its stronghold there - the city of Raqqa."

It follows the recent awarding of the c2c franchise, which runs from the City of London to Essex, to Italian state operator Trenitalia. The equivalent of 863 million such trips were made last year, which was 50% of total journeys, the figures show. The breakdown of the annual journeys made on Britain's railways on services owned by foreign countries are: :: Germany 391 million:: Netherlands 197 million:: France 143 million:: Hong Kong 86 million:: Italy 46 million Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald called for the railways to be renationalised as he claimed it is ""ludicrous"" that foreign government-owned firms are invited to run UK services ""in their own interests"" but the British state ""is banned from doing so"". He said: ""With promised upgrades delayed or cancelled, punctuality at its worst for a decade and fares up 27% since 2010, it's becoming increasingly difficult for the Tories to justify allowing private and foreign state-owned companies to take money out of the system, which should be used to improve services or hold fares down. ""When in public hands, the East Coast Mainline returned over £1bn to the Treasury, kept fares down, had record passenger satisfaction and had excellent industrial relations. We should be building on that success."" Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said privatisation has failed passengers and left foreign state train operators ""laughing all the way to the bank"". He added: ""The case for public ownership of UK rail to end this racket is now overwhelming."" The number of journeys being made on Britain's railways has more than doubled over the past two decades, from 846 million in 1997/8 to 1.72 billion in 2015/16. Recent analysis by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), representing train companies and Network Rail, found that 6,400 more train services will be running each week by 2021 due to the ongoing £50bn investment in the network. RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: ""Passengers and taxpayers have benefited from franchising, where rail companies from around the world bring new ideas and innovation to Britain's railway, and railways across the world still want to learn from our successes. ""Rail companies have worked together to transform Britain's railway, doubling the number of passengers and creating one of the world's safest railways. ""Under franchising, the railway has gone from costing taxpayers £2bn a year in terms of day-to-day costs to contributing £200m, money which helps to fund major rail upgrades."" A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""Rail franchises are awarded through fair and open competition to the bidder offering the best deal for passengers and the taxpayer. We look for expertise and knowledge to build a better railway."" The Government is delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century which will improve journeys by providing ""more seats, more of the services people want and modern stations,"" she added."
2017-04-02,"Cabinet ministers secretly agreed that Britain should put security on the table in Brexit talks, despite official Government denials, it is reported.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170402153829/http://news.sky.com/story/security-on-the-table-during-brexit-talks-10821808,"There was ""panic"" from EU leaders about the impact the UK's exit would have on security in the face of ""increased Russian aggression"", according to The Sunday Telegraph. The paper claims leaked minutes of a Brexit Cabinet committee meeting on 7 March show ministers identified the UK's ""very strong hand"" on defence as a key advantage in negotiations. The disclosure comes after Boris Johnson attempted to play down a row triggered by Theresa May in her Article 50 letter to the European Council president, Donald Tusk, by claiming Britain's support for EU security was ""unconditional"". In her letter, which sparked a furious backlash in the EU, the Prime Minister said failure to reach a Brexit deal on trade ""would mean our co-operation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened"". But in an interview with France's Le Figaro, asked whether Britain was trying to use security cooperation as a bargaining chip to secure an EU trade deal, Mr Johnson said: ""No, not at all."" He added: ""We consider the historic contribution of the UK to the security and stability of Europe as unconditional. ""We will maintain this contribution, which benefits all of Europe and the world. It's in our interest and in the interest of others, and we hope this will be one of the planks of our deep and special partnership (with the EU)."" But according to The Sunday Telegraph, ministers at the 7 March meeting said security would be a ""defining"" issue for the EU and that Britain should not ""underplay"" its hand as it seeks to secure a favourable free trade deal. The paper claims Cabinet ministers Sir Michael Fallon, David Davis, Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson are all understood to have spoken up about the importance of British security to the EU ahead of talks. A source familiar with the discussions told the paper: ""While there were nuances, I think the absolute view around the table was we are in a very strong position and the Europeans know it. ""We go into these negotiations with security and defence being a big thing in our corner."" A Government source has declined to comment on the leak, but said that Britain wants ""a deep and special partnership with the EU covering all aspects including security"". The PM faced allegations of ""blackmail"" and ""threats"" by EU figures after her Article 50 Brexit letter mentioned security 11 times across six pages. On the same day Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, said in a Sky News interview: ""If we left Europol, then we would take our information with us."" Number 10 has insisted no ""threat"" was intended and that the UK Government was not explicitly linking the country's help on security with a trade deal. However, The Sunday Telegraph claims to have obtained an official account of the 7 March meeting, at which a paper on Britain's defence and security drawn up by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office is said to have been submitted for discussion. According to the paper, it both spelled out the country's existing EU security links and reported back what EU leaders were thinking on the topic, including rising concerns over Russian aggression. Mr Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, led discussions by saying that Britain had a ""strong hand"" at the negotiating table when it came to security, the paper reports. He stressed that ""we should not be a demandeur"" in negotiations when it came to security - the French word for someone who makes demands - but be aware of the tactical advantage. Sir Michael, the Defence Secretary, is understood to have said: ""Insecurity in Europe is at its highest since the Cold War. There is increased Russian aggression. ""The EU needs our capabilities,"" he is recorded as adding, before saying that the UK had ""high cards"" to play at the negotiating table on security. Mr Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is noted as saying: ""I agree that Britain has high cards and a very strong hand [on security]. ""The UK is in a strong position and there is a degree of panic within Europe over defence policy and cooperation."" He is said to have added that the UK should not ""underplay"" its hand. Mr Hammond, the Chancellor, said that the EU would not offer an economic relationship which deterred Britain from co-operating on defence. He added the UK should make that ""clear"" during talks. The Prime Minister is said to have attended the meeting and summed up at the end. She is understood to have said that defence and security were a ""defining issue for the EU"" and that the UK is in a ""strong position"". Those familiar with the talks said there was no mention of ""threatening"" the EU but an acceptance the UK could use its strong position during negotiations. A Government source told The Sunday Telegraph: ""We do not comment on Cabinet Committee leaks, however we have been clear that we want a deep and special partnership with the EU covering all aspects including security. ""Our position is simply a statement of fact - if we leave with no agreement in place, the arrangements we currently have will lapse. We are not bargaining security with anyone - we want to maintain the degree of cooperation on these matters that we have currently."""

But the very fact he could be seen to make even a vague comparison to the Falklands War less than a week after Article 50 was triggered can hardly count as a diplomatic win. He is a former leader of the Prime Minister's party - these sorts of things are noticed in the chancelleries of Europe, unfair or not. At the very least it's hardly going to do much to ameliorate Anglo-Spanish relations, which have had a torrid week. Nor for that matter will the Spanish foreign minister's comments in Spanish broadsheet El Pais, where he confirmed Spain would not veto an independent Scotland's entry into the EU.Whether this is a storm in a teacup or the descent in a diplomatic debacle, it's indicative of the scale of the PM's challenge. For its manifold faults, the EU was quite good at one thing: papering over the cracks of inter-state EU relations. Tensions over issues with other EU countries like the UK-Irish border, UK's Cyprus bases and Gibraltar were (to some extent at least) eased by our mutual EU membership. We will no longer enjoy that greasing of the wheels, and bear in mind that every one of the remaining 27 EU states has a veto over whatever the Brexit negotiations produce. Therefore the PM hasn't just got to keep the Eurocrats in Brussels on side but also each and every government of the other 27 leaders - which could themselves change as elections come and go over the next few years. Each have their own particular take on Brexit and the relationship their own countries have with Britain, so she can ill-afford rows like this. The negotiations haven't even begun yet and they've already been waylaid by a Mediterranean peninsula 2.6 square miles in size. It must make Downing St feel uneasy, at best."

She is believed to be with six-year-old Dylan Madge and Louis Madge, aged nine. Police issued a missing person appeal on Tuesday, and a day later said they are treating the disappearance as an abduction. On Monday, Nottingham Family Court ordered the two boys be removed from the care of their mother. In a highly unusual move, the court has now issued a statement in which it said: ""It is assumed that she has abducted Louis and Dylan. The children have now been made wards of court. ""Miss Baldwin is considered to pose a risk of harm to the children."" Nottinghamshire Police have said Ms Baldwin could be ""harboured by someone"", may have used a different name or changed her or the boys' appearance. They have urged bed and breakfast operators and hotel and guest house owners and staff to check their registers. Superintendent Rich Fretwell said police were ""increasingly concerned"" for the boys' welfare and safety. ""Samantha has no legal custody of the boys at this time,"" he said. ""Our investigation team are exploring a number of lines of inquiry. There's always the possibility that Samantha could be being harboured by someone. ""We would urge that person to come forward and let us know where the boys are."" Two women, aged 62 and 36, have been released on bail after their arrest on suspicion of assisting an offender. Ms Baldwin is described as 5ft 7in, of slim build, with shoulder-length blonde hair and green-blue eyes; Louis has collar-length straight fair hair, a fair complexion and blue eyes, while his brother Dylan has collar-length straight brown hair, a tanned complexion and brown eyes. Anyone with information should call Nottinghamshire Police on 101 urgently, quoting incident number 332 of March 27."

Debbie Leach from environmental group Thames 21 is behind a campaign which it is hoped will raise public awareness. She described the number of wet wipes in rivers as ""completely disgusting"". ""It's layer upon layer of wet wipes and they will be here for a very long time as the plastic in the wipes takes so long to breakdown."" :: Sky Ocean Rescue: How to get involved She added: ""One study showed seven in 10 flounders in the Thames had plastic in their stomachs. ""We are using wipes in our everyday lives more and more and we are seeing so much more of them in the River Thames. ""It is so unnecessary. ""Just don't put them down the loo."" When flushed down the toilet, wet wipes mix with fats and oils and can develop into huge so-called ""fatbergs"", which can block drains and sewers. These mounds of wipes can then overflow into rivers, settling on twigs and mud, collecting on the riverbanks where water flows more slowly, even changing the shapes of the riverbeds themselves. In its third annual survey, Thames 21 and a group of volunteers combed the foreshore near Hammersmith in London, where the biggest concentration of wet wipes has been found - more than 235 per square metre. AJ McConville, who organised the count, said its purpose was to collect real data to highlight the scale of the problem. He said: ""We have been coming down to the river over the last 20 years and in that time things like shopping trolleys and bags have decreased but new issues have emerged, including wipes. ""We want to see this disappear and stop the river getting dirty in the first place. ""Wet wipes are made of lots of different fabrics but often it can be polyester, which is reinforced by plastic. ""The issue there is that once it gets into the environment it will break down into lots of tiny plastics which fish will eat and then those plastics will get into the food chain."""

They were attacked at their house in Stourbridge, West Midlands, on Thursday. A 23-year-old homeless man whom the family helped in the past, Aaron Barley, has been accused of their murder. Ms Wilkinson, an 18-year-old student at Bristol University, was accompanied by her boyfriend as she visited the scene, where a police tent remains outside the house. In a statement, the family said it was ""devastated"" by the loss of Mrs Wilkinson and Pierce. ""They were extremely loved by all of their family and friends. ""Pierce was a fun-loving, friendly and happy boy, who loved computer games and made everyone smile. ""Tracey was loving, caring and a wonderful mother and daughter. Always putting others before herself."" The statement said that, while Barley had never lived with the family, he had been assisted by them in the past 12 months. Barley is due to appear in Birmingham's Crown Court on Monday. He is accused of the murders of Mrs Wilkinson and Pierce as well as of the attempted murder of Mrs Wilkinson's husband Peter, who was injured and remains in hospital in a serious condition."

He told Sky News Presenter Sophy Ridge: ""Certainly prices could rise on supermarket shelves. Prices of foreign manufacturers could rise, the UK could become less competitive, lots of production lines in the Midlands and the North could close if we don't get this right."" Every year, £119bn of trade flows through the Port of Dover, as well as millions of freight vehicles. Mr Waggott claims that even small delays in processing these huge volumes of freight could cause major problems - as the port currently handles about 99 miles (160km) worth of traffic on busy days. ""We overflow our available space two or three times a week, at peak times. That will be a daily occurrence,"" he said. However, not everyone fears the worst. Robert Hardy, operations director at the Motis freight service in Dover, said he saw Brexit as an opportunity rather than a threat - and said concerns about traffic flowing through the port efficiently have been raised long before the UK's vote to leave. He explained: ""It was 25 years ago there were only a million trucks a year. There are four million trucks a year now. Technology has come on leaps and bounds and I think that technology can help smooth the path. ""If we're saying that everything requires customs clearance again post Brexit, 98% of that will be processed concurrently in five-minute chunks. I don't see it as such a large issue."" As well as Dover's important role in trade between the UK and the rest of the continent, 13 million passengers also rely on the port each year. But Brexit could also have huge consequences for immigration, as it may result in the border being moved from Calais to the UK. Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the ISU union for borders, immigration and customs, says losing the Border Force's presence in France means there would be no way to stop asylum seekers from boarding lorries bound for the UK. She described a ""doomsday scenario"" where tens of thousands of people attempt to arrive on UK soil. ""Once an individual has got inside a container, got on board a ferry, they are, to all intents and purposes, here,"" Ms Moreton told Sky News. ""We're going to have to hear that asylum claim, we're going to have to support them during that claim. At the moment, that can take 18 to 24 months, if not longer. ""It risks making the UK even more of a magnet for asylum seekers and migration than it already is."" At the moment, the entry of individuals holding EU passports is not controlled by UK border officials - but Ms Moreton expressed concern that changes to the immigration system after Brexit could leave the agency massively understaffed. ""If we can no longer do that… we could need at least as many staff again as we have now. We have about 8,000 border officers right now. We could easily need to double that,"" she said. The next two years of Brexit negotiations could prove decisive for Dover, where 62% of voters backed Brexit in last June's referendum. :: Watch the full interview on Sophy Ridge on Sunday at 10am on Sky News"

""Gibraltar is not for sale,"" Mr Johnson told The Sunday Telegraph. ""Gibraltar cannot be traded. Gibraltar will not be bargained away."" He added: ""The policy of the Government remains fixed and firm. The sovereignty of Gibraltar cannot be changed without the express consent of the UK and the people of Gibraltar."" Praising Gibraltar's ""vibrant business centre"", Mr Johnson said its harbour remained a ""key NATO asset"" because it can take nuclear submarines. ""The UK Government can be counted on to stick up for those interests - for instance in insurance and maritime services - which create jobs not just in Gibraltar but in the wider region of southern Spain,"" he said. ""The status of Gibraltar has been unchanged since 1713. It made no difference when the UK joined the Common Market in 1973 and when Spain was not yet a member. It should make no difference today. ""So let us go into these discussions with goodwill and optimism and get a deal that is good for the UK, good for Spain, and good for the people of Gibraltar."" Spain has a long-standing territorial claim on Gibraltar, which has been held by the UK since 1713 and has the status of a British overseas territory. Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo, also speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, hit out at the threat of a Spanish veto on the Rock's future. ""It is a slap in the face for the people of Gibraltar who are the ones who most vehemently supported remaining in the European Union,"" he said. ""It is unfair, it demonstrates that Spain will use any opportunity to try and advance its claim to Gibraltar."" The heat is being turned up on the Government after criticism of Theresa May for failing to mention Gibraltar in her Article 50 letter to European Council president Donald Tusk. Downing Street has said the Prime Minister made clear in her Commons statement on Article 50 on Wednesday that the Government was ""absolutely steadfast in our support of Gibraltar, its people and its economy"". But former Tory MP Lord Boswell, chairman of the House of Lords EU Committee, has said it was ""unfortunate that the Prime Minister's letter to Donald Tusk, triggering Article 50, made no mention of Gibraltar"". He said that ""in the absence of any clear commitment to defend Gibraltar's interests by the Prime Minister, the door has been opened for the EU to present it as a disputed territory"". At the same time, negotiation guidelines set out by Mr Tusk appear to put the future of Gibraltar at stake by giving Spain a veto in discussions about the Rock's future. ""After the UK leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom,"" he wrote. Pro-Gibraltar Tory MP Andrew Rosindell told Sky News the Government must stand firm against the Spanish threat. ""Any Brexit agreement without including Gibraltar means there can be no agreement,"" he said. ""British people must stand together. We cannot be bullied by Spain. Any deal must apply equally to the whole British family and that includes Gibraltar. There can be no compromise on this."""

Sir Alan gushed: ""I just think they are the best advertisement for the UK across the world."" The Prince of Wales is in Florence with his wife the Duchess of Cornwall, attending a series of engagements focusing on food, farming, wool and culture. UK ministers, as part of the royal delegation, are expected to travel with them to Rome on Tuesday and Wednesday when the Prince will meet senior Italian political figures. :: Prince Charles walks amid ruins of quake-hit Amatrice On Sunday, Charles visited the town of Amatrice where he hugged some of those who lost loved ones in last summer's earthquake. He walked through the rubble of the ""red zone"" where all the buildings have been demolished and met families who are now living in temporary accommodation. Charles and Camilla are spending five days of this tour in Italy. The Prince has already visited Romania and the royal couple will also travel to Austria. The tour is seen as an important diplomatic mission in the week after Theresa May triggered article 50, paving the way for Britain to leave the European Union. Silvia Francescon, at the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank in Rome, believes the Prince's visit to Amatrice sends a positive message but doesn't believe the royal tour can impact on Brexit negotiations. She told Sky News: ""I don't think it's going to make a big difference in terms of policy or what is going to change. We are just at the beginning and even the negotiators themselves don't know what is coming."" By the end of the year the Royal Family will have visited the majority of the EU's major member states - France, Germany, Italy and Poland - with the King of Spain also coming to the UK for a state visit. The Government and Foreign Office see the ""soft power"" of the Royal Family as a vital tool for maintaining friendships with European countries, and creating a positive environment within which Britain will negotiate its exit from the EU."

Italy, the Netherlands and Canada also topped the survey. Researchers analysed data on almost 8,700 babies in different countries taking part in previous studies to find out how much babies cry in their first 12 weeks. Infants in Denmark, Germany and Japan were found to cry the least. Researchers found that on average, babies cried for around two hours per day in the first two weeks after birth. Crying peaked at about two hours, 15 minutes per day at six weeks before gradually reducing to an average of one hour, 10 minutes. Lead researcher Professor Dieter Wolke, from the University of Warwick, said: ""We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy experiences or genetics."" He said the chart would help health professionals determine whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first three months, or excessively. The highest levels of colic - defined as a baby crying more than three hours a day for at least three days a week - were found in the UK, then Canada and Italy. Denmark and Germany had the lowest rates. The findings are to be published in the Journal of Pediatrics."

Speaking to reporters on a flight to Jordan, as she began a trade and security visit, the PM laughed when asked to rule out a war with Spain. ""What we're doing with all European countries in the European Union is sitting down and talking to them,"" she said. ""We're going to be talking to them about getting the best possible deal for the United Kingdom and for those countries, Spain included."" When asked if it was a case of ""jaw-jaw"" rather than ""war-war"", Mrs May replied: ""It's definitely jaw-jaw."" However, the Prime Minister refused to directly criticise Lord Howard. The former Tory leader said on Sunday: ""I think there's no question whatever that our Government will stand by Gibraltar. ""Thirty-five years ago this week, another woman prime minister sent a task force half way across the world to defend the freedom of another small group of British people against another Spanish-speaking country. ""I'm absolutely certain that our current prime minister will show the same resolve in standing by the people of Gibraltar."" When asked later to clarify his comments, Lord Howard said: ""I can see no harm of reminding them what kind of people we are."" Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis criticised Lord Howard's comments, saying: ""Comparing Gibraltar with the Falklands is taking things out of context. ""The Spanish government is a little surprised by the tone of comments regarding Gibraltar coming out of Britain, which is a country known for its composure."" Mrs May said: ""Our position on Gibraltar has not changed. We will be working with them as part of our negotiations to get the best possible deal for the UK and the best possible deal for Gibraltar."" Asked about the EU Council draft negotiating guidelines for the future EU-UK trade deal, including a veto for Spain on its application in Gibraltar, the Prime Minister, for the first time, confirmed that Spain - and every member of the EU27 - already has a veto on any future deal. ""What I say about the final deal and when we negotiate that final deal is the following: obviously there'll be 27 states that remain in the EU that will have to agree that deal with us but I'm confident that when it comes to delivering that deal, they will see that it is not just good for the UK it is good for them, and in the end it is that which will win through,"" said Mrs May. This is a clear acknowledgement of the European Council view expressed in its draft negotiating guidelines on Friday, that the UK will have to leave before negotiating a future trade deal. That deal will be concluded not under Article 50 (for which Spain does not have a veto) but with the UK as a ""third country"" under Article 218, offering every remaining member state a veto. It is also a tacit acknowledgement that agreeing a comprehensive trade deal will take longer than two years. In Luxembourg, where EU foreign ministers gathered for a monthly meeting, Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief wouldn't be drawn on the issue. Asked what the EU position is on the Gibraltar issue, why the EU draft Brexit guidelines singled it out and whether the EU was siding with Spain, she told Sky News: ""I am sorry, that is not a foreign policy issue, yet.""."

He was left with a fractured skull and a blood clot on his brain but is said to be ""starting to make a recovery"" in hospital. His two friends managed to escape with minor injuries.

The party could lose up to 15 seats to the Liberal Democrats, his projections suggest, but make major gains from Labour and could take a handful of seats from the Scottish Nationalists. Lord Hayward said: ""My expectation is if there was an election this year - and I don't expect there will be one - the Tory majority would be towards 100."" Mrs May has repeatedly played down the chances of a snap poll and last month her spokesman told journalists: ""It isn't going to happen."" But reports suggest potential dates have been discussed by cabinet ministers, and this weekend the Labour Party was reported to have been building a funding war chest to fight one. Lord Hayward, a former Conservative MP in Bristol, also predicted a catastrophic night for Labour in May's local elections, with losses of around 125 seats to all parties. It is highly unusual for the main opposition party not to make gains in local elections. He predicted Labour could be on course for its worst election results since 1985 after the damaging SDP split. The greatest losses are expected to come in Scotland with an ""iconic"" loss forecast in Glasgow. Lord Hayward said the result for Labour would be a reflection of the fact the party is failing to appeal to the ""old core of working class voters in the Midlands, north and Scotland"". The Conservatives are expected to capitalise on the ""Ruth Davidson effect"" in Scotland and gain 100 seats across England, Scotland and Wales.. :: Are Lib Dems on the brink of death or a comeback? The big winners are forecast to be the Liberal Democrats who are expected to make a gain of 100 seats, after a dismal drubbing at the last general election, and have a good prospect of taking control in Somerset and Cornwall. After delivering its political ""earthquake"" in 2013, UKIP is expected to lose 80-90 seats, which will be a significant blow. If the Conservatives don't call a general election by next year - which Labour MPs would have to vote for, under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act - they may have to fight seats on new boundaries."

First, in Jordan, she will announce a joint anti-terror initiative, with new moves ""to strike at the heart of Daesh"", and promise to improve co-operation on countering violent extremism in the region. Then, in Saudi Arabia, the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East, as well as talks on boosting trade between the two countries she will attempt to step up co-operation on counter-terrorism. During her visit, the Prime Minister is expected to say that the tragic attack in Westminster on 22 March ""showed only too starkly that terrorism is an evil facing us all and we must come together to fight it"". She will also say that working with countries such as Jordan on the frontline in the fight against terror keeps British people safe, and that sharing intelligence with Saudi Arabia has saved hundreds of lives in the UK. According to 10 Downing Street, she will also discuss how the UK Government can build on co-operation with Jordan to manage the fall-out from the Syrian conflict. She is expected to reiterate the UK's commitment to providing humanitarian support to Jordan to bolster its capacity to handle the huge number of refugees it hosts, enabling the refugees to stay close to their homes and create meaningful long-term futures for themselves. The Prime Minister will begin her visit in Jordan's capital, Amman, where she is expected to agree new support for the Royal Jordanian Air Force to improve its capability to strike Daesh targets and defeat the terrorist threat. She will then visit Saudi Arabia, where - according to No 10 - she will make clear that they are a close and important ally and that the UK will continue to work closely in a range of areas, particularly on counter-terrorism, where UK-Saudi cooperation is vital. On trade, the Prime Minister is expected to explore ways of boosting already strong ties. Exports of British goods were worth £4.67bn in 2015 and services £1.9bn. Speaking ahead of her visit, the Prime Minister said: ""As the United Kingdom leaves the EU, we are determined to forge a bold, confident future for ourselves in the world. ""We must look at the challenges that we, and future generations, will face and build stronger partnerships with countries that will be vital to both our security and our prosperity. ""It is clearly in the UK's security and prosperity interests to support Jordan and Saudi Arabia in tackling regional challenges to create a more stable region, and in delivering their ambitious reform programmes to ensure their own stability. ""An even deeper partnership with these countries, and greater knowledge and understanding of one another, will increase our ability to address the issues that concern us, including the promotion of international standards and norms. ""To tackle the threats we face from terrorism and from geopolitical instability, we must meet them at their source. ""Jordan is on the frontline of multiple regional crises and I'm clear that by working with them, we are helping keep British people safe. ""Likewise in Saudi Arabia: we must never forget that intelligence we have received in the past from that country has saved potentially hundreds of lives in the UK. ""And there is so much we can do together on trade, with immense potential for Saudi investment to provide a boost to the British economy. ""So I hope my visit will herald a further intensification in relations between our countries and deepen true strategic partnerships, enabling us to seize the opportunities ahead and ensure the security and prosperity of our people for decades to come."" It is not the Prime Minister's first visit to these two key Gulf states. She visited Jordan in 2012 when she was Home Secretary and also visited Saudi Arabia in March 2014. The UK Government's new support for the Royal Jordanian Air Force will include: :: Deploying training teams to help the Jordanians better integrate their Air and Land assets on operations;:: Providing training in the UK and in Jordan for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, who are the service personnel who direct combat action of aircraft in offensive operations;:: Increasing the number of places available to RJAF personnel on UK courses in niche areas such as Air Battle Management and Electronic Warfare; and:: Supporting aviation safety, including through training in both the UK and Jordan. According to No 10, the UK will also commit to partnering with Jordan in the development and implementation of strategies to counter violent extremism, including active consultation with civil society and affected communities, particularly focusing on youth groups."

""People are using them to fly behind properties to see if the lights are on, to see what sort of French windows they have or whether there are windows open."" Among the cases are complaints from neighbours, including one where a man said his neighbour was flying a drone ""just to annoy"" him. Among complaints were reports of drugs being dropped into prisons and a burglary was reported after a drone was seen hovering over houses. Members of the public have also contacted police to report drones being used for snooping, such as a complaint about a drone said to have flown over a garden a number of times while girls were sunbathing. There have also been several instances of drones being spotted near aircraft, something that could potentially cause a dangerous - if not fatal - crash. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for drones, said: ""As awareness of what drones are and what they can do continues to grow, police forces have seen increases in concerns and reports by the public. ""We have to balance the growth of this technology by ensuring that the public are aware of the strong regulatory framework and detailed user guidance that is available relating to drone use."""
2017-04-03,"Almost one in three people in Britain are at risk of heart disease because of physical inactivity, according to a new study.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170403190755/http://news.sky.com/story/sitting-for-too-long-carries-risk-of-early-death-says-british-heart-foundation-10822856,"The British Heart Foundation claims that levels of sedentary behaviour remain stubbornly high and are likely to be causing as many deaths as smoking. The charity warns that the UK is suffering one of the most significant national health crises and says that even physically active people are risking cardiovascular disease if they don't take part in regular vigorous exercise. The BHF's associate medical director Dr Mike Knapton said that the issue presents a substantial threat to the nation's cardiovascular health and carries the risk of early death. He said: ""Making physical activity easier and more accessible for all is of paramount importance if we are to reduce the burden of inactivity-related ill health. ""Sedentary activity is a problem as well - you might be physically active in the evening, but if you spend most of your time sitting behind a computer, whether that's playing computer games or at work, that too is a risk."" The charity is urging people to kick-start a more active lifestyle with a challenge to people of all fitness levels to run the equivalent of a marathon (26.2 miles) over the space of one month. Playing video games, reading and socialising are all listed as examples of ""sedentary behaviour"" along with the use of mobile phones and computers. According to the heart charity the most inactive region in the UK is the North West. Sky News caught up with a group of web designers who had called into a Manchester cafe with their computers to continue their work during lunchtime. One of them, Chris Atkin, said: ""I don't do much physical activity day to day. ""I know when I was younger I could get away with a lot more. ""I'm not 30 yet but I feel that if I continue with this lifestyle without exercise and without being careful what I eat in 10 years time I'm going to regret it and there wont be any coming back from it."" His colleague Edward Mortlock said that he spent on average seven and a half hours in front of a computer screen and up to a further two hours at home. He said: ""Once you've had a really long session being focused on your work and not really having the time to move around you do get stress on your back and you do start feeling it physically."" :: Women are 36% more likely to be classified physically inactive than men - 11.8 million women compared to 8.3 million men. :: The BHF estimates the average man spends over a fifth of his lifetime sitting - equivalent to 78 days each year. :: More than 5 million deaths worldwide can be attributed to physical inactivity, making it one of the top 10 leading causes of death. However Dr Knapton said: ""It's relatively simple and easy to do something about it. ""We can all do something to improve matters, and the first thing, I think, is that we can all take a bit more physical activity in our lives. ""It might not meet the Chief Medical Officer's guidelines, but just taking more physical activity on a daily basis will reduce your risk of heart disease, fatal heart disease in the future."""

A total of 16 people are being held over the attack. The victim, aged 17, and two friends are believed to have been waiting at a bus stop in Shrublands Avenue, near The Goat pub, at about 11.40pm on Friday when they were approached by a group of people. The teenager, who is Kurdish Iranian, was subjected to what is being called a hate crime. He was left with a fractured skull and a blood clot on his brain but is said to be ""starting to make a recovery"" in hospital. His two friends managed to escape with minor injuries. Detectives investigating the assault believe between 20 to 30 people were involved. Daryl Davis, 20, Danyelle Davis, 24, Barry Potts, 20, George Walder, 20, and Jack Walder, 24 - all from Croydon - are charged with violent disorder.

2017-04-03,"Nine months on from referendum result, the ball is rolling on Brexit and the daunting workload involved is becoming clearer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170403190755/http://news.sky.com/story/is-there-anything-beyond-brexit-10819710,"But while Theresa May will be remembered as the Prime Minister who steered Britain out of the European Union, is there room for anything else? It's an active debate at the heart of Government. The reasons are obvious. Today's newspapers lead on the acute pressures on social care, with a damning report from MPs showing funding is in freefall. Elderly people who pay their own way (because they have assets of more than £23,250) are being charged even more to cover the increasing toll of those whose care is covered by the state. Meanwhile, the NHS - which featured heavily in the Leave campaign - has axed its 18-week limit for operations. The four-hour A&E target limps on, but the last time it was met was the summer of 2015. In one horrifyingly case, Kayden Urmston-Bancroft, aged 20 months, died after his operation was cancelled for three days running. Such a story would once have had a Government on the ropes. Schools funding is also on the political agenda in a way it hasn't been for years, with parents asked to buy their own textbooks as head teachers grapple with funding gaps. For patients awaiting operations, parents worried about school places and the legions of young people working but with no hope of buying a home, there are more immediate concerns than Brexit over the next two years. Theresa May is acutely aware of all this. She declared in her party conference speech in October that the referendum vote was ""not just a vote to withdraw from the EU, it was about something broader"". ""It was about a sense deep, profound and let's face it often justified - that many people have today that the world works well for a privileged few, but not for them."" The Queen's speech on 17 May is a chance, Tory MPs say, to put her sentiment - about broken markets, burning injustices and building infrastructure - into action. But it will be dominated by Brexit-related bills. ""There will be some domestic stuff, but all likelihood it will be Brexit with bells on"", a senior Conservative tells me. A relatively quiet group of MPs and ministers believe making the most of Brexit means turbo-charging economic reforms now to meet the need of the future - on skills, apprenticeships and rebalancing the economy away from London and the financial services sector. ""We need to prepare for global Britain now, or we're just promising jam tomorrow. But there's real debate about whether the Government has the bandwidth for it"", says one figure familiar with discussions in Number 10. Education and skills and a bill about workplace practices are expected to feature in the speech, but they won't be the headlines. Deep thinking about public services is under way, but in the medium term there are only sticking plasters. If Mrs May is constrained by her small majority, she is also immeasurably helped by the lack of credible opposition. Her party retain a significant poll lead on almost every issue apart from the NHS, on which Labour have a slim lead. In polls asking the public what issues they are concerned about, leaving the EU has been at the top of the agenda since June. But Joe Twyman of YouGov explains that this isn't quite what it seems. He said: ""The impact Brexit has on all those issues - from the economy to health and immigration - means that they're all judged through that prism now. If promises aren't delivered on health or immigration, the Tories could still take a big hit in the polls."" The scale of the Brexit challenge is setting in. Hundreds of sittings of Parliament are expected to be devoted to arranging 40 years of EU legislation onto our statute books. Whitehall must set up a new immigration system, repatriate business regulation, farming subsidies, environmental protections and all manner of other things. There's the prospect of deadlock with the Remainers in Parliament as well as difficulties with Brussels. Mrs May's legacy won't be her domestic reforms, but her Brexit success will be judged on whether voters feel that life is really getting better."

The pair are expected to discuss trade and territorial disputes in the South China Sea as well as aggression from Pyongyang during meetings on Thursday and Friday. Mr Trump told the Financial Times: ""Yes, we will talk about North Korea. ""And China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't. ""And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone."" He suggested trade should be the main incentive for China to co-operate, but said the US could ""totally"" handle North Korea alone if necessary. Asked to elaborate on his plan, he said: ""I'm not going to tell you. ""You know, I am not the United States of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the Middle East."" While diplomatic and economic support from China is believed to be crucial to the survival of the Pyongyang regime, Beijing insists it has limited influence. During his election campign, Mr Trump was outspoken on China - threatening to raise import taxes and declare China a currency manipulator. He told the FT he did not want to discuss tariffs with President Xi at the forthcoming meeting, adding: ""Perhaps the next time we meet."" In Oval Office, @realDonaldTrump delivers his verdict: ""You lost, I won"". Full interview coming soon... pic.twitter.com/gwE6RCNq5N FT editor Lionel Barber, who interviewed Mr Trump in the Oval Office, told Sky News: ""He is the master destabiliser. ""The guy looks for leverage and I think this applies to everything. He likes to be the negotiator. ""He likes to stake out a big aggressive position and then come back, and I think you can see that in terms of foreign policy and the big story of course on North Korea."" UN resolutions have failed so far to deter North Korea from conducting nuclear and missile tests. Last year, the North conducted two nuclear tests and two dozen tests of ballistic missiles. Mr Trump's UN ambassador Nikki Haley said at the weekend that China ""has to co-operate"" with the US to tackle North Korean aggression. The President appeared to soften his approach to the European Union in the interview - praising the bloc's response to the Brexit vote. He said: ""I think Brexit is very good for the UK, it is going to be very good for UK. ""I would have thought when it happened that more would follow, but I really think the European Union is getting their act together. It could be a very good thing for both."" He added: ""If you would have asked me that the day after the election... I would have said, 'Yeah, it will start to come apart'. ""But they have done a very good job and - I am meeting with them very soon - they have done a very good job in bringing it back together."" Mr Trump, who frequently criticised Angela Merkel during the 2016 presidential campaign, insisted he had a ""great"" meeting with her. The talks in March included an awkward moment when Mr Trump appeared to decline a handshake with the German chancellor in front of the press."

The newspaper said it found call handlers asleep at their desks or describing themselves as ""busy"" on the internal computer system to avoid new calls and patients. Technical glitches reportedly ended with one handler hanging up on at least three patients, including one with heart palpitations. Workers were told to tell callers they were experiencing technical failures when they may have been struggling to work the system, according to The Sun. The newspaper reported an alleged conversation with one of the handlers about how she dealt with a suicidal patient. The newspaper said the handler told the undercover reporter ""she was crying and I was asking her stuff like, 'do you not really want to talk', she was like, 'no'... I put her on mute"". A Department of Health spokesman described the claims as ""clearly completely unacceptable"" if found to be true. He said: ""The NHS is now urgently investigating and if any wrongdoing whatsoever is found, including criminal actions, we will want to see the police and relevant NHS regulators alerted as necessary.""

In one incident, a pilot taxied on to a runway at a Midlands airport without permission. Another mid-air event involved confusion over left and right on an approach to Manchester Airport. The authority commissioned the independent review to assess whether there were any dangers from these incidents. It identified that there is a risk of ""serious"" accidents at home and abroad. A total of 267 incidents that required reporting, called mandatory occurrence reports (MOR), were based on language problems during the period under examination. The report said that cheating in exams, corruption and inadequate testing was partly to blame. It said: ""For the safety of the UK travelling public, it is imperative that all pilots and controllers working in international aviation have the proficiency to communicate clearly and succinctly in all situations, routine and non-routine. ""Language-related miscommunication, including lack of ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) proficiency standards, certainly has the potential to be the cause of serious incidents or even accidents. ""Several MOR that reported language-related miscommunication had the potential to develop into serious incidents or accidents."" To work in international civil aviation, pilots and controllers are required to gain a Level 4 qualification in English from the ICAO. But the report said it found there were enough non-UK pilots and controllers with below-standard English skills to give ""grounds to suspect cheating on aviation English exams"". In one country, candidates who started with no English skills received their certificates after 10 days' tuition - an ""impossible"" feat, according to one of the report's contributors. The report's author, consultant linguist Dr Barbara Clark, recommended increasing spot checks, improving the reporting of incidents where language was an issue and a crackdown on cheats. A CAA spokesman said it was discussing the findings with the UK's Department for Transport, adding: ""We will be studying this research and will work with ICAO, other international regulators and the wider aviation industry on any actions that can help (to) enhance safety."""

Stuart Arch's family firm delivers 9,000 pints of week to doorsteps around Coventry. About 40% of those are in glass bottles. But despite the environmental benefits of reusable bottles being delivered by an electric milk float, the majority of customers are older people who prefer the taste and tradition of glass. But there is a glimmer of hope. Stuart says: ""I've had two or three younger customers in the last month who've asked to switch over from plastic containers to glass bottles. Mainly for environmental reasons, but also for the taste."" Sky is now actively campaigning for the introduction of a bottle return scheme for plastic bottles. And using more glass could also be a way forward. One of the main problems though, is cost. A pint of milk in a glass bottle delivered by Stuart costs around 70p. A four pint carton is around £1.70. Stuart's father Derek (at 88 Britain's oldest milkman) sums it up with the benefit of his 75 years of experience in the trade. ""I don't think you'll swing anybody, lad.

UK Financial Investments (UKFI), which manages the process, has been selling off shares since 2014 and is just £300m shy of recouping all of the money used for the bailout. ""We have now recovered over £20bn for the taxpayer and are very close to recovering all of the money taxpayers injected into the bank during the financial crisis,"" said the City Minister Simon Kirby MP. The Government's current plan will see Lloyds returned entirely to the private sector by the autumn, but some in the financial industry expect the process to be completed as early as June. Lloyds has also revealed plans to reduce the size of hundreds of its branches. In some cases staffed counters will be removed in favour of self-service machines, with the ""micro branches"" taking up just 1,000 square feet. The converted branches will also include some Halifax and Bank of Scotland locations, and will be staffed by two people each who will carry tablets to help customers use the machines.

More than three quarters (77%) said they wanted to see a halt on any further alterations to pension rules going forward. The government under David Cameron and George Osborne removed limits on buying and selling pension annuities as part of the spring budget in 2015, allowing people to cash in their pension pots for a lump sum rather than receive regular payments during retirement. But Prudential's report suggests the changes have led to increased confusion, particularly around the issue of tax bills. It had been expected that the changes would mean a total of £900m being paid to HMRC between April 2015 and the end of 2016, but in fact this figure has ballooned to an expected £2.6bn. Vince Smith-Hughes, retirement income expert at Prudential, said: ""Nearly 550,000 people have accessed more than £9.2 billion in funds since the launch of pension freedoms, demonstrating that there is popular demand for the increased flexibility brought about by the reforms. ""However, two years on from the introduction of the new rules there is also widespread confusion, with two out of three over-55s admitting they don't fully understand the reforms. ""That underlines the importance of advice and guidance in ensuring that the pension freedoms are a long-term success and it is encouraging that many savers recognise how advice can help them to make the most of their retirement pot."" The challenges around planning for retirement have also been served a blow thanks to the volatility surrounding Brexit. Research by accountancy firm PwC has shown that the overall UK pension deficit has fallen by £20bn over the last month, despite relatively small market changes. Steven Dicker, PwC's chief actuary, said: ""Now the Brexit process has officially started, pension schemes face two years of uncertainty and potentially volatile deficits. ""This only adds to the challenge of long-term planning, especially when using a market 'snapshot' approach for actuarial valuations."""
2017-04-03,There aren’t too many pieces of infrastructure that have television advertisements made about them.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170403190755/http://news.sky.com/story/bp-sells-vital-forties-north-sea-pipeline-to-ineos-10823461,"But then the Forties Pipeline System (FPS) is not any old piece of infrastructure. The system, which once featured in a BP television advertisement with the tagline 'good old Forties', carries the equivalent of 40% of UK North Sea oil production to the mainland every day - some 445,000 barrels - and nearly a third of its gas. From today, though, FPS is no longer owned by BP. It has been bought by Ineos, the privately owned chemicals giant, for a maximum of $250m. It is difficult to overemphasise how important FPS has been both to the UK and to BP. The Forties oilfield, the largest in the North Sea and lying 110 miles to the east of Aberdeen, was discovered in October 1970 by BP. The discovery, in the words of former BP chief executive, Lord Browne, ""started the North Sea in earnest"" and signalled that the UK could be a major oil producer. It took almost another five years for the oil to reach the mainland. It was a hugely expensive and risky project in inhospitable and storm-swept territory. The 235-mile pipeline, transporting oil extracted from thousands of feet beneath the seabed, carries the oil 105 miles to the Cruden Bay terminal, near Peterhead, and then a further 129 miles to Kinneil processing plant next to the refinery and petrochemicals complex at Grangemouth. The first oil began flowing in September 1975, although FPS itself was only officially inaugurated by the Queen, accompanied by BP's chairman, Sir Eric Drake and the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, on 4 November that year. By 1990, the original pipeline to shore had become corroded and needed replacing with a much larger pipeline system to service other parts of the North Sea. Today's sale marks the end of that original, thrilling, adventure for BP. The company sold the Forties oilfield itself to Texas-based Apache Corporation as long ago as 2003 and offloaded Grangemouth and its other chemical assets to Ineos in 2005. Its interests in the North Sea now lie mainly to the west of the Shetland Islands, while the North Sea itself remains only a very small part of what BP does, although the experience it gained in Forties helped make the company a global force in deep-water exploration and production. Ineos, with its ownership of Grangemouth, is a logical buyer of FPS. A fifth of the oil flowing through the pipeline is used at Grangemouth and having it and the complex in the hands of one owner makes sense. As Jim Ratcliffe, the owner, chairman and chief executive of Ineos, points out, FPS was originally designed by BP to work together to feed the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical facilities. The unions see it differently. They fought a high-profile battle with Mr Ratcliffe over employment conditions in 2013 that almost led to Grangemouth's closure. The unions worry that, due to the high cost of North Sea oil production, Mr Ratcliffe could render uneconomic some of the 85 fields that use FPS by raising the tariffs paid by oil producers to access the pipeline. The original discovery of the Forties oilfield, and the pipeline that bought its black gold to shore, paved the way for 25 glorious years, between 1980 and 2005, in which the UK was self-sufficient in energy. Those days are gone, but there are plenty of companies still exploring in the North Sea, including BP. And FPS will continue to be part of that story for many years."

Emergency services found a woman in her 40s with her hand bitten and a man with injuries to both of his legs. A second woman was also taken to hospital suffering from shock. ""Armed response officers were deployed to the scene and two dogs were humanely destroyed and two dogs have been seized,"" Greater Manchester Police said. ""Officers are currently searching the area for another dog who is believed to be part of the group."" This dog is described as large, short haired, of a bulky-muscular build and police warned it should not be approached. A 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of affray and allowing a dog to be dangerously out of control in public. ""Highly trained officers responded quickly to the scene and took control to avoid the situation from escalating,"" said Superintendent Chris Allsop. ""The officers acted with our number one priority in mind - to protect people and prevent them from harm. ""I'd like to thank the public for their patience and full cooperation as we remain at the scene and carry out our inquiries."" Two roads that were closed have now reopened, and officers are trying to find the injured dog. Anyone who sees a dog loose in the area is asked to tell police, while witnesses or those with information are urged to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2017-04-03,BP has agreed to slash millions of pounds from its chief executive’s maximum pay deal for the next three years in a bid to head off the threat of a fresh shareholder revolt.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170403190755/http://news.sky.com/story/bp-slashes-dudley8217s-maximum-payout-by-1635m-to-avert-new-revolt-10823937,"Sky News has obtained the details of the FTSE-100 oil giant's future pay policy - which will be disclosed in its annual report later this week amid intense political scrutiny of boardroom pay packages. Insiders briefed on the terms of the deal that will be awarded to Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, said the company had decided to reduce his maximum long-term incentive plan award from seven times his $1.85m (£1.48m) basic salary to five times. The framework, which will also apply to other top BP directors between this year and 2019, will see his annual bonus remain constant at a maximum of 225% of his salary. Crucially, though BP has bowed to investors' demands to toughen the criteria for awarding bonuses to executives. Under the plans to be published this week, Mr Dudley will receive half his maximum annual bonus entitlement - about £1.66m, or 112.5% of his base salary - if the company achieves on-target levels of performance. Previously, he could earn 150% of his salary in short-term bonuses just for meeting those targets. City sources said the company had informed shareholders that it would also scrap the matching element of Mr Dudley's short-term incentive scheme, which meant that he could previously earn as much as an additional £2.2m annually by deferring the payment of up to two-thirds of the bonus award for three years. Excluding pension contributions and other payments, Mr Dudley's maximum annual pay over the next three years will be roughly £12.2m - comprising his salary, an annual bonus of £3.33m and an LTIP award worth up to £7.4m. That compares to a total package previously valued at up to £17.4m including the matching share awards - meaning that BP has axed more than £5m of potential pay for its chief executive. In 2015, Mr Dudley was paid $19.6m (£14m at April 2016 exchange rates), thanks partly to a $6.5m increase in the value of his BP pension. Sources said the concessions being offered by BP would probably be enough to win the support of investors at its AGM in mid-May, following an extensive round of meetings lasting more than six months. The news of BP's plans comes as MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee prepare to publish on Wednesday a string of recommendations aimed at curtailing a boardroom pay culture that they believe is too complex, unwieldy and prone to rewarding bosses without clear justification. BP's annual report will be among the most closely watched of any major company, coming 12 months after an investor rebellion at its AGM paved the way for ministers to curb excessive boardroom remuneration. Last year's revolt saw nearly 60% of investors voting against BP's remuneration report - a stunning result at such a prestigious British company. On Saturday, the Daily Mail reported that Mr Dudley's pay package had been reduced to £8.4m in 2016 - a figure on which BP declined to comment. Earlier this year, Paul Drechsler, the CBI president, told Sky News that the forthcoming pay season would be critical if businesses wanted to avert more intrusive regulation. Sky News revealed in January that BP had approached shareholders with a plan to cut Mr Dudley's maximum LTIP award for the next three years from 700% of his base salary to 550%. Since then, it has gone further, mindful of City hostility to its pay plans following a period in which it cut thousands of jobs and reported its biggest-ever annual loss. BP has since begun to turn the corner, drawing a line under most of its remaining liabilities from the fatal Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 - an accident which cost the company well over $60bn (£48bn). It has continued to shed non-core assets, but has also been in acquisition mode, striking deals with Kosmos Energy in west Africa and an Abu Dhabi state oil company. BP last year ditched its long-standing adviser on executive pay, appointing consultants at Deloitte in his place. However, the chairman of its remuneration committee, Dame Professor Ann Dowling, has remained in place - and was re-elected with overwhelming support at last year's annual meeting. BP declined to comment on Monday."
2017-04-03,New rules governing the credit card market could see customers having their cards suspended while they work to pay off persistent debt.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170403190755/http://news.sky.com/story/new-credit-card-rules-could-help-customers-shake-off-persistent-debt-10823189,"The changes suggested by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) call on firms to take a more proactive approach with struggling customers. It could mean agreeing repayment plans to clear the debt quicker; or firms reducing, waiving or cancelling interest or charges where a repayment plan is still unaffordable. Customers who fail to cooperate or who cannot afford the repayment plans would lose the use of their cards. An FCA study found many firms did not intervene because persistent debtors - defined as those who have paid more in interest and charges than in actual debt repayments over an 18-month period - are often very profitable. It estimates around 3.3 million people in the UK are in persistent debt, with more than half (1.8 million) remaining so for at least two consecutive periods of 18 months. The proposals also suggest giving customers greater control over increases to their credit limits by offering choices around how and when increases can be offered and making the process of declining them more straightforward. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive, said the proposed changes would give customers greater control. ""Persistent debt can be very expensive - costing customers on average around £2.50 for every £1 repaid - and can obscure underlying financial problems,"" he said. ""Because these customers remain profitable, firms have few incentives to intervene. ""We want to change this situation so that firms and customers will deal with outstanding debt more quickly, and avoid persistent debt in the first place."" A consultation has now been launched on the proposals and will run until July."

Thirty thousand coloured coins featuring Peter Rabbit are being released on Monday as collectables, as well as an unlimited number of plain ones. Later this year the other three in the set will be released both as collectables and for general circulation. The coins were created by designer Emma Noble, who has previously worked on pieces celebrating the Diamond Jubilee and Remembrance Sunday. They will add to a collection issued by the Royal Mint last year to mark the 150th anniversary of the author's birth. The 2016 batch showed illustrations of four of Potter's characters, Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Squirrel Nutkin. Anne Jessopp, of The Royal Mint, said demand was astonishing: ""The enormous popularity of the 2016 set exceeded everyone's expectations... The coins sold out almost instantly as people raced to collect a complete set of the four friends."" More than 45 million copies of Potter's original book, The Tale Of Peter Rabbit, have been sold since it was first published in 1902. The story's enduring popularity is also being celebrated on the big screen, with filming starting this month on a Hollywood remake. James Corden and Margot Robbie are among the stars voicing characters in the movie, which combines the scenery of the Lake District with CGI animation and is due for release in March 2018. Potter, who lived in the Cumbrian beauty spot for the last 40 years of her life, died in 1943 aged 77."

The duo, from Wales, were Sir Tom's favourites to win, and the judge was heard saying ""f*** me"" when they were announced for the final. Presenter Emma Willis was forced to apologise for the language. Moments later, a man wearing a baseball cap was seen crashing the stage, holding a piece of paper which was meant for the viewers to read. He was quickly tackled by security staff, before the audience could take a look at the message. The moment was mocked on Twitter, with some users pointing out the small letters in the piece of paper. ""If you're going to do a stage invasion, at least write big enough so we can read,"" one user wrote. Others praised the show's response to the incident, with one tweeter posting that it had ""the quickest security runners I ever saw"". @thevoiceuk #thevoiceuk that was the quickest security runners I ever saw #stage invasion 😂😂😂😂😂 The show went on to see 21-year-old Adeniran crowned as this season's winner, securing a Polydor recording contract.

The discovery by a team at the University of Manchester has the potential to revolutionise water filtration across the world, particularly in countries which cannot afford large-scale desalination plants. While the graphene-oxide membrane had previously been used to filter out large salt crystals, scientists have now found a way to control the pore size of the membrane. The discovery, which was announced in the Nature Nanotechnology journal, means the graphene layer can now sieve common salts out of salty water, making it safe to drink. Professor Rahul Nair, who lead the team of researchers in Manchester, says it is a ""significant step forward"" that will ""open new possibilities for improving the efficiency of desalination technology"". Graphene was originally isolated by two researchers at the University of Manchester in 2004 - Professor Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov, who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work. By 2025, the UN expects that 14% of the world's population will encounter water scarcity. International development charity WaterAid says one in 10 people in the world live without safe water and 315,000 children aged under five die from diseases caused by dirty water every year - about one child every two minutes."

The value of the pound dropped by almost 20% after the result of the EU referendum was announced last June and, although it has recovered slightly, it remains well below its previous levels. This means that anything bought from the UK by international customers and exported out will cost less, while importing into the UK has become more expensive. Asos has local language sites in the UK, US, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Australia and Russia and also offers free delivery to most locations worldwide when a minimum amount is spent - usually around £20. Excluding the affects of currency fluctuations the company still performed well globally, with the sales boost still equating to 42%. Nick Beighton, ASOS chief executive, said the firm was pleased with the results. ""These are a strong set of results, showing great progress across the business,"" he said. ""International growth of 54% has been excellent and with the 'rest of the world' segment a stand out performer. ""Given the current momentum we are seeing, ASOS is making good progress towards its ultimate goal of becoming the world's number one destination for fashion-loving 20-somethings."" The global boost means ASOS' profit before tax for the period was up 14% compared to the same time last year, reaching £27m. UK retail sales also saw an increase, growing 18% to hit £341m. The company's statistics on the average amount spent on the site appear to indicate consumer appetite has not taken too much of a hit since last June's vote. The average basket value of ASOS orders reached £70.86 - a £2 increase - with the average number of items purchased in one online shop growing to 2.76."

Mackie, 28, thought the notices were unenforceable and that she had a right to park in the area as her mother and stepfather were tenants at the time. But the firm, Vehicle Control Services, took her to court and won. In a written judgement, Sheriff George Way said Mackie was in breach of contract after she ignored the notices. He said she had been ""simply wrong in her analysis of the contractual chain of authority that this had led her to take a position on the ground that rendered her liable to such substantial charges"". Sheriff Way said: ""She had no better right or title to do so than any other interloper or stranger, no matter what her belief might be. ""The defender refused to pay the parking charges not because she was unaware of the parking scheme or the terms of the notices or the financial consequences of parking at any time, but because she did not believe that the charges were valid in law."" Interest will be charged at eight percent a year until the debt is repaid, according to reports. Private firms give out parking charge notices - which are different to the penalty charge notices given out by local authorities. Parking charge notices are not backed up by law in the same way and are invoices for a breach of contract. Ms Mackie said in 2015, she said: ""We have a right to park in front of our own property. ""I've considered moving out. ""It just makes my life so hellish. ""I always make a point of parking in front of my own garage, where nobody else could park, and never parking on the double yellow lines on the road."" Debt Recovery Plus, which acted on behalf of the parking company, said Mackie's fine is thought to be the ""highest value"" parking charge case in the UK."

The attack on Reker Ahmed, who was left with a fractured skull and spine, as well as a blood clot on his brain, is said to have involved about 20 people. It happened as the 17-year-old, who is Kurdish Iranian, and friends Dilshad Mohammed and Hamo Mustafa were waiting at a bus stop in Shrublands Avenue, near The Goat pub, at about 11.40pm on Friday. A crowd-funding site set up for Mr Ahmed, who is recovering in hospital, has raised more than £24,000. Police say the victim was chased and subjected to a ""brutal attack"" after a group of people discovered he was an asylum seeker. His friends managed to escape with minor injuries.

The party could lose up to 15 seats to the Liberal Democrats, his projections suggest, but make major gains from Labour and could take a handful of seats from the Scottish Nationalists. Lord Hayward said: ""My expectation is if there was an election this year - and I don't expect there will be one - the Tory majority would be towards 100."" Mrs May has repeatedly played down the chances of a snap poll and last month her spokesman told journalists: ""It isn't going to happen."" But reports suggest potential dates have been discussed by cabinet ministers, and this weekend the Labour Party was reported to have been building a funding war chest to fight one. Lord Hayward, a former Conservative MP in Bristol, also predicted a catastrophic night for Labour in May's local elections, with losses of around 125 seats to all parties. It is highly unusual for the main opposition party not to make gains in local elections. He predicted Labour could be on course for its worst election results since 1985 after the damaging SDP split. The greatest losses are expected to come in Scotland with an ""iconic"" loss forecast in Glasgow. Lord Hayward said the result for Labour would be a reflection of the fact the party is failing to appeal to the ""old core of working class voters in the Midlands, north and Scotland"". The Conservatives are expected to capitalise on the ""Ruth Davidson effect"" in Scotland and gain 100 seats across England, Scotland and Wales.. :: Are Lib Dems on the brink of death or a comeback? The big winners are forecast to be the Liberal Democrats who are expected to make a gain of 100 seats, after a dismal drubbing at the last general election, and have a good prospect of taking control in Somerset and Cornwall. After delivering its political ""earthquake"" in 2013, UKIP is expected to lose 80-90 seats, which will be a significant blow. If the Conservatives don't call a general election by next year - which Labour MPs would have to vote for, under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act - they may have to fight seats on new boundaries."

And this looks set to continue, with the Bank of England expecting inflation to climb to around 2.8% by the end of the year and some analysts predicting it could even breach the 3% mark. The weakness in sterling following the Brexit vote has led to increased costs for producers, distributors and often the supermarkets themselves, and these hikes are being passed on to the consumer through higher prices or the reduction in size of some products. With wage growth unlikely to keep pace with the hike in costs, families may be looking for cheaper alternatives during the weekly shop, a trend which is already emerging; own-branded products have taken 5% of market share from their branded rivals during the past 12 weeks. This sentiment is also reflected in statistics from consumer research company Neilsen, which found that just over a quarter of the money spent at UK supermarkets so far this year went on cut-price products or multi-buy offers - the lowest levels since 2006. ""The level of promotional spend has gone back to levels not seen since before the 2008/09 economic crisis,"" said Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight. ""There's also been a shift away from multi-buy to simpler price cuts, which is in tune with shopper needs to make it easier to manage their basket spend."" In terms of the performance of individual retailers, Lidl and Aldi are continuing their march forward and both reached their highest ever market shares during the beginning of the year, now holding a combined share of 11.7% of the grocery sector. Lidl was top of the table in terms of sales growth with a 15% boost, while Aldi saw a 14.3% increase over the three-month period. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda all lost a small amount of their market share and saw a drop in sales compared to last year, but this has likely been affected by the fact that Easter is scheduled later this year compared to 2016."

Today's newspapers lead on the acute pressures on social care, with a damning report from MPs showing funding is in freefall. Elderly people who pay their own way (because they have assets of more than £23,250) are being charged even more to cover the increasing toll of those whose care is covered by the state. Meanwhile, the NHS - which featured heavily in the Leave campaign - has axed its 18-week limit for operations. The four-hour A&E target limps on, but the last time it was met was the summer of 2015.

Schools funding is also on the political agenda in a way it hasn't been for years, with parents asked to buy their own textbooks as head teachers grapple with funding gaps. For patients awaiting operations, parents worried about school places and the legions of young people working but with no hope of buying a home, there are more immediate concerns than Brexit over the next two years. Theresa May is acutely aware of all this. She declared in her party conference speech in October that the referendum vote was ""not just a vote to withdraw from the EU, it was about something broader"". ""It was about a sense deep, profound and let's face it often justified - that many people have today that the world works well for a privileged few, but not for them."" The Queen's speech on 17 May is a chance, Tory MPs say, to put her sentiment - about broken markets, burning injustices and building infrastructure - into action. But it will be dominated by Brexit-related bills. ""There will be some domestic stuff, but all likelihood it will be Brexit with bells on"", a senior Conservative tells me. A relatively quiet group of MPs and ministers believe making the most of Brexit means turbo-charging economic reforms now to meet the need of the future - on skills, apprenticeships and rebalancing the economy away from London and the financial services sector. ""We need to prepare for global Britain now, or we're just promising jam tomorrow. But there's real debate about whether the Government has the bandwidth for it"", says one figure familiar with discussions in Number 10. Education and skills and a bill about workplace practices are expected to feature in the speech, but they won't be the headlines. Deep thinking about public services is under way, but in the medium term there are only sticking plasters. If Mrs May is constrained by her small majority, she is also immeasurably helped by the lack of credible opposition. Her party retain a significant poll lead on almost every issue apart from the NHS, on which Labour have a slim lead. In polls asking the public what issues they are concerned about, leaving the EU has been at the top of the agenda since June. But Joe Twyman of YouGov explains that this isn't quite what it seems. He said: ""The impact Brexit has on all those issues - from the economy to health and immigration - means that they're all judged through that prism now. If promises aren't delivered on health or immigration, the Tories could still take a big hit in the polls."" The scale of the Brexit challenge is setting in. Hundreds of sittings of Parliament are expected to be devoted to arranging 40 years of EU legislation onto our statute books. Whitehall must set up a new immigration system, repatriate business regulation, farming subsidies, environmental protections and all manner of other things. There's the prospect of deadlock with the Remainers in Parliament as well as difficulties with Brussels. Mrs May's legacy won't be her domestic reforms, but her Brexit success will be judged on whether voters feel that life is really getting better."

Last month, however, prosecutors in the 83-year-old's case told a hearing that he should return to the US and should not receive special treatment because of his fame. Polanski's lawyers had said he would return from nearly 40 years on the run if he was promised he would not have to spend any more time in jail. Deputy District Attorney Michele Hanisee said: ""The People simply do not believe it is in the best interests of justice to give a wealthy celebrity - and that's what Mr Polanski is - different treatment than any other fugitive from justice."" She said Polanski ""wants answers but will only show up if he likes the answers"". Harland Braun, representing Polanski, admitted the film-maker had committed an ""indefensible"" crime but said the court had ""lied"" to him about his possible sentence. Mr Braun said his client ""wants to wrap up"" the case, adding: ""We know what he was promised - we know he has served eight times what he was promised"". But in a statement on Monday, a Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman said Judge Scott Gordon had ""ruled that defendant's motions and corresponding requests are denied"". In his ruling, Judge Gordon wrote: ""There is no sufficient or compelling basis for reconsideration of these issues."" The French-Polish director lives in France, having fled the US after 42 days in jail because he said a judge had gone back on a promise about how he would be sentenced. He was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 on a US extradition request and spent 10 months under house arrest before the request was rejected by the Swiss. The US then asked Poland to send him back in 2015 but courts there decided he had served his time. Another court hearing is set for 26 April in the US regarding a bid by Polanski's lawyers to unseal evidence given in the case by original prosecutor Roger Gunson."

They've come to flee America through its northern border, in to Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police waiting on the other side of the snowy ditch tell them they will be arrested if they cross at this unofficial border point. They know this, but it is still scary to hear. The group pauses, just a few feet from the border. One man is starting to shiver in the cold. Another explains that his visa has expired and he cannot go back to his war-torn country. ""Can you help us, please?"" asks the woman as she tries to hold both her children to stop them standing in the snow, but they are wriggling and she lets one go. He is giggling and playing next to abandoned luggage and a baby stroller from previous crossings as his mother calculates if this is going to be worth the risk. Suddenly an officer offers the information she is waiting to hear - she will be arrested, processed, and then if all is well, released to the immigration authorities. The two men, the woman and her sons take just a few steps over the invisible border and in to police custody, hoping to one day become a refugee in Canada. The next morning it happens again. Three smartly dressed men from Turkey say they want to claim asylum in Canada. They don't speak much English but they've brought carefully written letters explaining why they want to leave. One is a former history teacher who was arrested and harassed in Turkey. He's been living in the States but now feels he cannot remain here. Why not stay in America? I asked. ""Because Trump. Because Donald Trump"", his friend says, shaking his head. In just this one location these crossings are happening up to five times a day. Up and down this vast border region thousands have done the same, the numbers increasing sharply since Donald Trump rode to power on a wave of populist anti-immigrant sentiment. The Canadian Border Services Agency says there was a six-fold increase in refugee claims just at Quebec's border in February compared to the same month in 2016. Nationally, the agency says that in January and February 2017 more than 2,500 people crossed over and made asylum claims. RCMP Corporal Francois Gagnon said: ""It's mostly families ... parents with kids, strollers. ""We're going to use compassion on every occasion, but definitely seeing those families crossing the border, you know it touch somewhere our hearts, you know we are all most of us fathers and mothers, so the approach is going to be softer. For many, being detained by the Canadian police is actually the aim. An agreement between the US and Canada prevents people from either country seeking refugee status in the other. But if they are arrested while crossing illegally, most people are given a criminal background check and then are released and given access to housing, schools, emergency healthcare and work permits while they await immigration hearings. Immigration lawyer and head of the Canadian Association for Refugee Lawyers Mitchell Goldberg said: ""I think it's decent, I think it's the right thing to do, I think it's an investment in the future of Canadians."""

The newspaper said it found call handlers asleep at their desks or describing themselves as ""busy"" on the internal computer system to avoid new calls and patients. Technical glitches reportedly ended with one handler hanging up on at least three patients, including one with heart palpitations. Workers were told to tell callers they were experiencing technical failures when they may have been struggling to work the system, according to The Sun. The newspaper reported an alleged conversation with one of the handlers about how she dealt with a suicidal patient. The newspaper said the handler told the undercover reporter ""she was crying and I was asking her stuff like, 'do you not really want to talk', she was like, 'no'... I put her on mute"". A Department of Health spokesman described the claims as ""clearly completely unacceptable"" if found to be true. He said: ""The NHS is now urgently investigating and if any wrongdoing whatsoever is found, including criminal actions, we will want to see the police and relevant NHS regulators alerted as necessary."" The report also claimed that managers changed the undercover reporter's timesheets to show he had done more training hours than he had. Simon Douglass, medical director of the London Central and West Unscheduled Care Collaborative, which runs the centre, said patient safety ""is, and always will be, our highest priority"". He said: ""We take any allegations extremely seriously and have launched an urgent investigation. The matters leading to the allegations appear to have arisen earlier this year when the undercover reporter participated in training. ""All issues relating to staff conduct are extremely important to us, particularly in relation to patient safety. We strictly enforce our policies for managing staff conduct at all times including whenever we receive reports of inappropriate conduct or behaviour."""

Theresa May said it was ""absolutely ridiculous"" that the word Easter was not being used in the name of the events, which are expected to be enjoyed by 350,000 people. Despite the alterations to the site, a National Trust spokesperson said: ""It's nonsense to suggest the National Trust is downplaying the significance of Easter. ""Nothing could be further from the truth. We host a huge programme of events, activities and walks to bring families together to celebrate this very special time of year. ""A casual glance at our website will see dozens of references to Easter throughout."" The spokesperson added that ""the branding and wording"" for the tie-up with Cadbury was always lead by them. The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu told the Daily Telegraph: ""The Cadburys were great Quaker industrialists. ""If people visited Birmingham today in the Cadbury World they will discover how Cadbury's Christian faith influenced his industrial output. ""He built houses for all his workers, he built a church, he made provision for schools. ""It is obvious that for him Jesus and justice were two sides of the one coin. ""To drop Easter from Cadbury's Easter Egg Hunt in my book is tantamount to spitting on the grave of Cadbury."" Cadbury's promotional video for the event calls it the ""Great British Egg Hunt"" and its website encourages chocolate lovers to ""enjoy Easter fun"". It also has tabs for ""Easter hunt"" and ""Easter products"". The chocolate-maker said its Easter campaigns were given a different name every year. It added: ""It is clear to see that within our communications and marketing we clearly state the word Easter and include it in a number of promotional materials, including our website, where we do also promote our partnership with National Trust at this seasonal time of year. ""We invite people from all faiths and none to enjoy our seasonal treats, which can be found around Easter time."""

Thirty thousand coloured coins featuring Peter Rabbit are being released on Monday as collectables, as well as an unlimited number of plain ones. Later this year the other three in the set will be released both as collectables and for general circulation. The coins were created by designer Emma Noble, who has previously worked on pieces celebrating the Diamond Jubilee and Remembrance Sunday. They will add to a collection issued by the Royal Mint last year to mark the 150th anniversary of the author's birth. The 2016 batch showed illustrations of four of Potter's characters, Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Squirrel Nutkin. Anne Jessopp, of The Royal Mint, said demand was astonishing: ""The enormous popularity of the 2016 set exceeded everyone's expectations... The coins sold out almost instantly as people raced to collect a complete set of the four friends."" More than 45 million copies of Potter's original book, The Tale Of Peter Rabbit, have been sold since it was first published in 1902. The story's enduring popularity is also being celebrated on the big screen, with filming starting this month on a Hollywood remake. James Corden and Margot Robbie are among the stars voicing characters in the movie, which combines the scenery of the Lake District with CGI animation and is due for release in March 2018. Potter, who lived in the Cumbrian beauty spot for the last 40 years of her life, died in 1943 aged 77."
2017-04-04,Prime Minister Theresa May will reveal details of a jobs and education package to help the most vulnerable victims of the Syrian conflict.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/pm-to-unveil-1631bn-package-for-syrian-refugees-and-countries-that-host-them-10824079,"The £1bn package, which includes £840m that was promised last year and £160m of new money, aims to give support to refugees and the countries hosting them. It will be unveiled by the PM during her visit to Jordan, where she will visit a school that is educating refugees alongside Jordanian children. Jordan has more than 650,000 registered Syrian refugees. The announcement also comes ahead of a Syria conference in Brussels on 4 and 5 April. The package aims to give refugees incentives to remain close to Syria rather than making the journey through Europe and potentially to the UK. It includes food, vaccinations, shelter and basic care for refugees in Syria and across the region; education for children in Jordan and Lebanon over the next three years and funding for infrastructure. It will also seek to create thousands of new jobs, vital building work, help for small and medium-sized businesses in Lebanon and technical advice to Jordanian and Lebanese governments to increase the growth of jobs and the private sector. The Government has been criticised for its approach to the humanitarian crisis, especially when a scheme to help unaccompanied child refugees was scrapped after taking around 350 youngsters rather than the 3,000 that campaigners hoped for. But Mrs May insisted the UK was a ""kind and generous country"". ""Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives and millions more have been forced to flee their homes by the barbarity of the Syria conflict,"" she said. ""The UK has led the international response to the defining humanitarian crisis of our generation, and will continue to set the pace. ""The ambitious approach agreed in London last year is delivering real results and giving refugees what they want - opportunities and education close to home that provide a meaningful alternative to risking their lives trying to reach Europe. This is clearly in the UK's national interest. ""We are a kind and generous country that will never turn our backs on those who so desperately need our support."" The Government said total UK funding for dealing with those affected by the Syria conflict stands at £2.46bn. Earlier on Monday, Mrs May was flown by helicopter to a military base on the outskirts of Amman, where she inspected military weapons such as rocket-propelled grenades, snipers and drones; and met troops. Mrs May held talks with King Abdullah over increasing defence and security ties between the UK and Jordan, which she said played an important role in maintaining stability in the region."
2017-04-04,There aren’t too many pieces of infrastructure that have television advertisements made about them.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/bp-sells-vital-forties-north-sea-pipeline-to-ineos-10823461,"But then the Forties Pipeline System (FPS) is not any old piece of infrastructure. The system, which once featured in a BP television advertisement with the tagline 'good old Forties', carries the equivalent of 40% of UK North Sea oil production to the mainland every day - some 445,000 barrels - and nearly a third of its gas. From today, though, FPS is no longer owned by BP. It has been bought by Ineos, the privately owned chemicals giant, for a maximum of $250m. It is difficult to overemphasise how important FPS has been both to the UK and to BP. The Forties oilfield, the largest in the North Sea and lying 110 miles to the east of Aberdeen, was discovered in October 1970 by BP. The discovery, in the words of former BP chief executive, Lord Browne, ""started the North Sea in earnest"" and signalled that the UK could be a major oil producer. It took almost another five years for the oil to reach the mainland. It was a hugely expensive and risky project in inhospitable and storm-swept territory. The 235-mile pipeline, transporting oil extracted from thousands of feet beneath the seabed, carries the oil 105 miles to the Cruden Bay terminal, near Peterhead, and then a further 129 miles to Kinneil processing plant next to the refinery and petrochemicals complex at Grangemouth. The first oil began flowing in September 1975, although FPS itself was only officially inaugurated by the Queen, accompanied by BP's chairman, Sir Eric Drake and the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, on 4 November that year. By 1990, the original pipeline to shore had become corroded and needed replacing with a much larger pipeline system to service other parts of the North Sea. Today's sale marks the end of that original, thrilling, adventure for BP. The company sold the Forties oilfield itself to Texas-based Apache Corporation as long ago as 2003 and offloaded Grangemouth and its other chemical assets to Ineos in 2005. Its interests in the North Sea now lie mainly to the west of the Shetland Islands, while the North Sea itself remains only a very small part of what BP does, although the experience it gained in Forties helped make the company a global force in deep-water exploration and production. Ineos, with its ownership of Grangemouth, is a logical buyer of FPS. A fifth of the oil flowing through the pipeline is used at Grangemouth and having it and the complex in the hands of one owner makes sense. As Jim Ratcliffe, the owner, chairman and chief executive of Ineos, points out, FPS was originally designed by BP to work together to feed the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical facilities. The unions see it differently. They fought a high-profile battle with Mr Ratcliffe over employment conditions in 2013 that almost led to Grangemouth's closure. The unions worry that, due to the high cost of North Sea oil production, Mr Ratcliffe could render uneconomic some of the 85 fields that use FPS by raising the tariffs paid by oil producers to access the pipeline. The original discovery of the Forties oilfield, and the pipeline that bought its black gold to shore, paved the way for 25 glorious years, between 1980 and 2005, in which the UK was self-sufficient in energy. Those days are gone, but there are plenty of companies still exploring in the North Sea, including BP. And FPS will continue to be part of that story for many years."

Speaking to reporters on a flight to Jordan, as she began a trade and security visit, the PM laughed when asked to rule out a war with Spain. ""What we're doing with all European countries in the European Union is sitting down and talking to them,"" she said. ""We're going to be talking to them about getting the best possible deal for the United Kingdom and for those countries, Spain included."" When asked if it was a case of ""jaw-jaw"" rather than ""war-war"", Mrs May replied: ""It's definitely jaw-jaw."" However, the Prime Minister refused to directly criticise Lord Howard. The former Tory leader said on Sunday: ""I think there's no question whatever that our Government will stand by Gibraltar. ""Thirty-five years ago this week, another woman prime minister sent a task force half way across the world to defend the freedom of another small group of British people against another Spanish-speaking country. ""I'm absolutely certain that our current prime minister will show the same resolve in standing by the people of Gibraltar."" When asked later to clarify his comments, Lord Howard said: ""I can see no harm of reminding them what kind of people we are."" Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis criticised Lord Howard's comments, saying: ""Comparing Gibraltar with the Falklands is taking things out of context. ""The Spanish government is a little surprised by the tone of comments regarding Gibraltar coming out of Britain, which is a country known for its composure."" Mrs May said: ""Our position on Gibraltar has not changed. We will be working with them as part of our negotiations to get the best possible deal for the UK and the best possible deal for Gibraltar."" Asked about the EU Council draft negotiating guidelines for the future EU-UK trade deal, including a veto for Spain on its application in Gibraltar, the Prime Minister, for the first time, confirmed that Spain - and every member of the EU27 - already has a veto on any future deal. ""What I say about the final deal and when we negotiate that final deal is the following: obviously there'll be 27 states that remain in the EU that will have to agree that deal with us but I'm confident that when it comes to delivering that deal, they will see that it is not just good for the UK it is good for them, and in the end it is that which will win through,"" said Mrs May. This is a clear acknowledgement of the European Council view expressed in its draft negotiating guidelines on Friday, that the UK will have to leave before negotiating a future trade deal. That deal will be concluded not under Article 50 (for which Spain does not have a veto) but with the UK as a ""third country"" under Article 218, offering every remaining member state a veto. It is also a tacit acknowledgement that agreeing a comprehensive trade deal will take longer than two years. In Luxembourg, where EU foreign ministers gathered for a monthly meeting, Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief wouldn't be drawn on the issue. Asked what the EU position is on the Gibraltar issue, why the EU draft Brexit guidelines singled it out and whether the EU was siding with Spain, she told Sky News: ""I am sorry, that is not a foreign policy issue, yet.""."
2017-04-04,BP has agreed to slash millions of pounds from its chief executive’s maximum pay deal for the next three years in a bid to head off the threat of a fresh shareholder revolt.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/bp-slashes-dudley8217s-maximum-payout-by-1635m-to-avert-new-revolt-10823937,"Sky News has obtained the details of the FTSE-100 oil giant's future pay policy - which will be disclosed in its annual report later this week amid intense political scrutiny of boardroom pay packages. Insiders briefed on the terms of the deal that will be awarded to Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, said the company had decided to reduce his maximum long-term incentive plan award from seven times his $1.85m (£1.48m) basic salary to five times. The framework, which will also apply to other top BP directors between this year and 2019, will see his annual bonus remain constant at a maximum of 225% of his salary. Crucially, though BP has bowed to investors' demands to toughen the criteria for awarding bonuses to executives. Under the plans to be published this week, Mr Dudley will receive half his maximum annual bonus entitlement - about £1.66m, or 112.5% of his base salary - if the company achieves on-target levels of performance. Previously, he could earn 150% of his salary in short-term bonuses just for meeting those targets. City sources said the company had informed shareholders that it would also scrap the matching element of Mr Dudley's short-term incentive scheme, which meant that he could previously earn as much as an additional £2.2m annually by deferring the payment of up to two-thirds of the bonus award for three years. Excluding pension contributions and other payments, Mr Dudley's maximum annual pay over the next three years will be roughly £12.2m - comprising his salary, an annual bonus of £3.33m and an LTIP award worth up to £7.4m. That compares to a total package previously valued at up to £17.4m including the matching share awards - meaning that BP has axed more than £5m of potential pay for its chief executive. In 2015, Mr Dudley was paid $19.6m (£14m at April 2016 exchange rates), thanks partly to a $6.5m increase in the value of his BP pension. Sources said the concessions being offered by BP would probably be enough to win the support of investors at its AGM in mid-May, following an extensive round of meetings lasting more than six months. The news of BP's plans comes as MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee prepare to publish on Wednesday a string of recommendations aimed at curtailing a boardroom pay culture that they believe is too complex, unwieldy and prone to rewarding bosses without clear justification. BP's annual report will be among the most closely watched of any major company, coming 12 months after an investor rebellion at its AGM paved the way for ministers to curb excessive boardroom remuneration. Last year's revolt saw nearly 60% of investors voting against BP's remuneration report - a stunning result at such a prestigious British company. On Saturday, the Daily Mail reported that Mr Dudley's pay package had been reduced to £8.4m in 2016 - a figure on which BP declined to comment. Earlier this year, Paul Drechsler, the CBI president, told Sky News that the forthcoming pay season would be critical if businesses wanted to avert more intrusive regulation. Sky News revealed in January that BP had approached shareholders with a plan to cut Mr Dudley's maximum LTIP award for the next three years from 700% of his base salary to 550%. Since then, it has gone further, mindful of City hostility to its pay plans following a period in which it cut thousands of jobs and reported its biggest-ever annual loss. BP has since begun to turn the corner, drawing a line under most of its remaining liabilities from the fatal Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 - an accident which cost the company well over $60bn (£48bn). It has continued to shed non-core assets, but has also been in acquisition mode, striking deals with Kosmos Energy in west Africa and an Abu Dhabi state oil company. BP last year ditched its long-standing adviser on executive pay, appointing consultants at Deloitte in his place. However, the chairman of its remuneration committee, Dame Professor Ann Dowling, has remained in place - and was re-elected with overwhelming support at last year's annual meeting. BP declined to comment on Monday."

The Federal Aviation Administration concluded that ""no administrative or enforcement action was warranted,"" Ford's lawyer, Stephen Hofer, said in a statement. He added: ""Mr Ford retains his pilot's certificate without restriction."" The actor, who played smuggler and Millennium Falcon pilot Han Solo in the ""Star Wars"" film franchise, was also praised by the agency for his ""long history of compliance"" with FAA regulations and ""his cooperative attitude during the investigation,"" Hofer said. Although Ford incurred no penalty, he agreed to undergo voluntary ""airman counselling"" before the FAA closed the matter. His lawyer said. ""It was Ford's second known misadventure in the more than two decades since becoming a licensed pilot."" In 2015, he crashed a vintage plane onto a golf course near a Santa Monica airport, suffering serious injuries and badly damaging the aircraft. He told investigators then he did not recall the moments before the plane went down. In addition to interviewing Ford following the Santa Ana incident, investigators examined tapes of pilot and air traffic control radio traffic, radar data and a 3D flight analysis. The actor was alone and at the controls of his Aviat Husky on a landing approach when he flew over a Boeing 737 preparing for takeoff with 116 passengers and crew on board, then landed his plane on a taxiway parallel to the runway assigned him. Ford was clearly embarrassed by the gaffe, according to radio traffic, telling the tower: ""I'm the schmuck that landed on the taxiway."" Audio also revealed Ford had apparently been distracted by an Airbus passenger jet landing just ahead of him. The FAA declined comment on the case other than saying it had completed an investigation of a 13 Feb incident in which a pilot landed on a John Wayne Airport taxiway. Ford has logged more than 5,000 hours of flight time without being subject to FAA discipline, Hofer said."

UK ministers, as part of the royal delegation, are expected to travel with them to Rome on Tuesday and Wednesday when the Prince will meet senior Italian political figures. :: Prince Charles walks amid ruins of quake-hit Amatrice On Sunday, Charles visited the town of Amatrice where he hugged some of those who lost loved ones in last summer's earthquake. He walked through the rubble of the ""red zone"" where all the buildings have been demolished and met families who are now living in temporary accommodation. Charles and Camilla are spending five days of this tour in Italy. The Prince has already visited Romania and the royal couple will also travel to Austria. The tour is seen as an important diplomatic mission in the week after Theresa May triggered article 50, paving the way for Britain to leave the European Union. Silvia Francescon, at the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank in Rome, believes the Prince's visit to Amatrice sends a positive message but doesn't believe the royal tour can impact on Brexit negotiations. She told Sky News: ""I don't think it's going to make a big difference in terms of policy or what is going to change. We are just at the beginning and even the negotiators themselves don't know what is coming."" By the end of the year the Royal Family will have visited the majority of the EU's major member states - France, Germany, Italy and Poland - with the King of Spain also coming to the UK for a state visit. The Government and Foreign Office see the ""soft power"" of the Royal Family as a vital tool for maintaining friendships with European countries, and creating a positive environment within which Britain will negotiate its exit from the EU."
2017-04-04,The finalists of the prestigious Bailey's Women's Prize for Fiction have been revealed and include three British writers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/womens-prize-for-fiction-shortlist-revealed-10824299,"The shortlist, announced in London, narrows down to six the number of female novelists competing for ""the best novel of the year written by a woman in the English language"". Alongside Britain's Naomi Alderman, Linda Grant and Gwendoline Riley are Nigeria's Ayobami Adebayo, Canada's Madeleine Thien and US writer C E Morgan. ""It was quite a challenge to whittle this fantastic long list of 16 books down to only six,"" said Tessa Ross, chair of the judging panel. ""From Kentucky in the 19th century to a dystopian future to a post-war sanatorium in the English countryside to 1980s Nigeria, the shortlist celebrates narratives that are daring and intimate, that examine the depth of human experience in unique and compelling ways,"" she added. Ross, who leads a panel made of five judges, said she was ""both impressed and moved"" by the books' characters, and that there ""were the six novels that stayed with all of us well beyond the final page"". Ayobami Adebayo's debut novel Stay With Me unravels against the social and political turbulence of 1980s Nigeria, ""weaving a devastating story of the fragility of married love, the undoing of family, the wretchedness of grief, and the all-consuming bonds of motherhood"". Naomi Alderman's The Power is the Briton's fourth novel, and explores the vengeful power of four women protagonists against their male abusers. Linda Grant, who previously won the prize in 2000 and was shortlisted again in 2008, now explores the lives of two teenage brothers in an English post-war sanatorium in The Dark Circle. Kentucky native C E Grant, named by The New Yorker as one of their 20 writers under 40, has written a book ""as mythic as the history of the South itself"", exploring themes of hunger, racism and injustice in the US. Madeleine Thien's Do Not Say We Have Nothing was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2016 and went on to win two other prizes, and follows the lives of two Canadian women who invite a Chinese dissident to their home. With a title drawing on one of Russia's biggest classics, Gwendoline Riley's First Love follows a writer's marriage to an older man, facing old scars and an intermittent conflict between love and individuality. The annual book award was setup in 1996 ""to celebrate and promote international fiction by women throughout the world to the widest range of readers possible"". Any woman writing in English - whatever her nationality, country of residence, age or subject matter - is eligible and the winner takes home a £30,000 prize. The award ceremony will take place in London on 7 June."
2017-04-04,New rules governing the credit card market could see customers having their cards suspended while they work to pay off persistent debt.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/new-credit-card-rules-could-help-customers-shake-off-persistent-debt-10823189,"The changes suggested by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) call on firms to take a more proactive approach with struggling customers. It could mean agreeing repayment plans to clear the debt quicker; or firms reducing, waiving or cancelling interest or charges where a repayment plan is still unaffordable. Customers who fail to cooperate or who cannot afford the repayment plans would lose the use of their cards. An FCA study found many firms did not intervene because persistent debtors - defined as those who have paid more in interest and charges than in actual debt repayments over an 18-month period - are often very profitable. It estimates around 3.3 million people in the UK are in persistent debt, with more than half (1.8 million) remaining so for at least two consecutive periods of 18 months. The proposals also suggest giving customers greater control over increases to their credit limits by offering choices around how and when increases can be offered and making the process of declining them more straightforward. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive, said the proposed changes would give customers greater control. ""Persistent debt can be very expensive - costing customers on average around £2.50 for every £1 repaid - and can obscure underlying financial problems,"" he said. ""Because these customers remain profitable, firms have few incentives to intervene. ""We want to change this situation so that firms and customers will deal with outstanding debt more quickly, and avoid persistent debt in the first place."" A consultation has now been launched on the proposals and will run until July."
2017-04-04,"Almost one in three people in Britain are at risk of heart disease because of physical inactivity, according to a new study.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/sitting-for-too-long-carries-risk-of-early-death-says-british-heart-foundation-10822856,"The British Heart Foundation claims that levels of sedentary behaviour remain stubbornly high and are likely to be causing as many deaths as smoking. The charity warns that the UK is suffering one of the most significant national health crises and says that even physically active people are risking cardiovascular disease if they don't take part in regular vigorous exercise. The BHF's associate medical director Dr Mike Knapton said that the issue presents a substantial threat to the nation's cardiovascular health and carries the risk of early death. He said: ""Making physical activity easier and more accessible for all is of paramount importance if we are to reduce the burden of inactivity-related ill health. ""Sedentary activity is a problem as well - you might be physically active in the evening, but if you spend most of your time sitting behind a computer, whether that's playing computer games or at work, that too is a risk."" The charity is urging people to kick-start a more active lifestyle with a challenge to people of all fitness levels to run the equivalent of a marathon (26.2 miles) over the space of one month. Playing video games, reading and socialising are all listed as examples of ""sedentary behaviour"" along with the use of mobile phones and computers. According to the heart charity the most inactive region in the UK is the North West. Sky News caught up with a group of web designers who had called into a Manchester cafe with their computers to continue their work during lunchtime. One of them, Chris Atkin, said: ""I don't do much physical activity day to day. ""I know when I was younger I could get away with a lot more. ""I'm not 30 yet but I feel that if I continue with this lifestyle without exercise and without being careful what I eat in 10 years time I'm going to regret it and there wont be any coming back from it."" His colleague Edward Mortlock said that he spent on average seven and a half hours in front of a computer screen and up to a further two hours at home. He said: ""Once you've had a really long session being focused on your work and not really having the time to move around you do get stress on your back and you do start feeling it physically."" :: Women are 36% more likely to be classified physically inactive than men - 11.8 million women compared to 8.3 million men. :: The BHF estimates the average man spends over a fifth of his lifetime sitting - equivalent to 78 days each year. :: More than 5 million deaths worldwide can be attributed to physical inactivity, making it one of the top 10 leading causes of death. However Dr Knapton said: ""It's relatively simple and easy to do something about it. ""We can all do something to improve matters, and the first thing, I think, is that we can all take a bit more physical activity in our lives. ""It might not meet the Chief Medical Officer's guidelines, but just taking more physical activity on a daily basis will reduce your risk of heart disease, fatal heart disease in the future."""
2017-04-04,"Sunderland manager David Moyes has said he ""deeply regrets"" threatening to slap a female reporter.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/sunderland-boss-david-moyes-sorry-for-slap-threat-to-female-reporter-10823336,"The incident happened in a post-match interview after the Premier League strugglers drew 0-0 with Burnley on 18 March. Reporter Vicki Sparks had asked Moyes if the presence of Sunderland owner Ellis Short at the game had put him under more pressure as the club battled relegation. He replied: ""No, none at all."" But in footage published by the Daily Star, Moyes, thinking he is off camera, adds: ""You were just getting a wee bit naughty at the end there, so just watch yourself. ""You still might get a slap, even though you're a woman. ""Careful the next time you come in."" The two were laughing at the time and Ms Sparks did not make a complaint, but Moyes said he later phoned her to apologise. ""It was in the heat of the moment,"" said Moyes, speaking on Monday. ""I deeply regret the comments I made. It's certainly not the person I am and I accept it was a mistake. ""I spoke to the BBC reporter who accepted my apology and hopefully we all move on."" ""Mr Moyes has apologised to our reporter and she has accepted his apology,"" said a spokesman for the broadcaster. But one domestic abuse charity called Moyes' comments ""appalling"". Clare Phillipson, director of Wearside Women in Need, said: ""I think the FA have to look into it. ""It is for the FA to set a clear standard about what they think is acceptable. ""It was dreadful, absolutely appalling. ""This is a woman, in a very small minority of sports journalists, trying to go about her job and being threatened. ""It's the sort of thing you expect down the local pub, not the kind of thing you get from a professional football manager."" Sunderland remain favourites to be relegated and are bottom of the Premier League following a 1-0 defeat at Watford on Saturday. They are eight points from safety and play again on Tuesday night at champions Leicester City."
2017-04-04,A 23-year-old man from Central Asia is believed to have been behind two bombs on the St Petersburg Metro.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/st-petersburg-bombing-suspect-linked-to-radical-islamist-groups-10824169,"The first bomb was detonated on a train between Sennaya Square and Technological Institute, two busy stations in the centre of the Russian city on Monday afternoon. At least 11 people were killed and dozens were injured in what is believed to have been a suicide attack. Russia's anti-terror agency said that less than two hours later, a second bomb was found and deactivated at Vosstaniya Square, a station that is a major transfer point for two Metro lines and also serves the rail line to Moscow. That bomb, which was disguised as a fire extinguisher, was filled with shrapnel and more than three times the size of the first explosive. The Interfax news agency cited an unidentified law enforcement official as saying that the suspected suicide bomber is believed to have left the larger bomb at Vosstaniya Square before blowing himself up on the train using the first bomb, which he carried in a backpack. :: Why Russian metro attack could have been much worse He is believed to have links to radical Islamist groups, although a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin would not comment, saying it was up to law enforcement agencies to talk about the investigation. Intelligence agencies In Kyrgyzstan said the likely suspect was a Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said US President Donald Trump called Mr Putin to pass on his condolences following the attack. In a statement, the Kremlin said Mr Trump had also asked Mr Putin to convey his support for the Russian people and that Mr Putin had thanked his American counterpart for the expression of solidarity. A White House statement said that Mr Trump had ""offered the full support of the US government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice"". Mr Putin was among those to visit an improvised memorial near the entrance to the Technological Institute station on Monday evening. Earlier he told Russians that law enforcement and intelligence agencies were working to ""give a full picture of what happened"". He promised help for victims of the explosion and their families. :: Video shows desperate struggle after Metro blast The UN Security Council has also condemned ""in the strongest terms the barbaric and cowardly terrorist attack"" in Russia's second city. Describing the moments after the explosion, student Maria Smirnova said: ""Everything was covered in smoke, there were a lot of firefighters. ""Firefighters shouted at us to run for the exit and everyone ran. Everyone was panicking."" Investigator Svetlana Petrenko said the driver of the train saved lives by continuing on to the next stop, reducing the danger to passengers who would have had to walk along electrified tracks. St Petersburg's metro has not been hit by terrorist attacks before but transport systems in other parts of Russia have, such as a suicide attack on a bus in Volgograd in 2013 which killed six people. Also in 2013, 34 people died after twin bombings at Volgograd train station and on a bus in the city."
2017-04-04,It did not take officials at the Russian General prosecutor's office long to declare the St Petersburg metro blast a terrorist attack.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/why-russian-metro-attack-could-have-been-much-worse-10824005,"The explosion, which took place at 3pm local time on the line running through the central Sennaya Ploshchad station, was caused by one, relatively small device consisting of 200g-300g of explosive material and metallic shrapnel. Contrary to initial reports in the Russian media, there was only one explosion but the national anti-terrorism committee, made up of officials from parliament and the security services, said an additional, unexploded bomb was later found in a carriage at Ploshchad Vosstaniya. This device was much larger at 1kg and designed to look like a fire extinguisher. It now appears this tragic event could have been much worse. Unsurprisingly, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said investigators would ""prioritise terrorism"" as they searched for the cause and told waiting reporters he had already been briefed by the head of the federal security service, or FSB. The leader was in St Petersburg at the time, preparing for a meeting with the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. ""Unfortunately, we have to start our meeting like this,"" he told waiting reporters. ""I have instructed the city authorities to give all the required support to families of the victims."" The Russian state maintains a formidable security infrastructure - resources that Mr Putin will now direct at uncovering the culprits of an attack that has killed at least 11. However, it is unlikely this explosion will have come as a surprise to members of the country's intelligence services. As in other parts of Europe, Russian civilians and Russian cities are potential targets for so-called Islamic State. We know that because members of IS have published videos online, in the Russian language, threatening revenge for Russia's role in Syria as Bashar al Assad's principle backer. IS claimed responsibility for the deaths of 219 Russians travelling home from Egypt in an airliner operated by Metrojet in 2015. The aircraft blew up 23 minutes after take-off from Sharm El Sheikh airport. Investigators later said a large bomb had been loaded in the luggage hold. On Russian soil, two separate suicide attacks in the city of Volgograd took the lives of 34 in 2013. The bombers claimed responsibility, in Russian, in the name of the ""Caucasus Emirate"" - an Islamic separatist group, but terrorist attacks in Russia have been relatively rare in recent years. By means of explanation, analysts believe thousands of men active in extremist circles have travelled south in order to fight with IS and other groups in Syria and Iraq. Mr Putin has justified his country's actions in Syria in this context - better to fight an estimated 7,000 extremists from the ex-Soviet republics in the Middle East, he says, than to wage war with them at home. Still, Russia's expansive and highly risky foreign policy has created plenty of enemies - the sort of people who may wish to do him and his countrymen harm. And the bombs on the St Petersburg metro system serve as a reminder to all that Mr Putin's Russia is vulnerable too."
2017-04-04,Theresa May is being criticised over her Brexit objectives by a committee of MPs. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170404104240/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-row-as-report-slams-theresa-mays-deal-claim-10824153,"A report published today by the Commons Exiting the European Union Committee suggests the Prime Minister needs to do more to consider the impact of failing to get a deal with the EU, after she claimed ""no deal is better than a bad deal."" The report suggests this claim is ""unsubstantiated."" However the conclusions have led to division among the Committee, with the report only gaining the backing of 10 out of the 16-strong group, with one Brexit-supporting MP describing the report as ""rushed, skewed and partisan"". :: Brexit: Has Britain left the EU yet?:: Is there anything beyond Brexit for PM? In the 124-page document entitled ""The Government's Negotiating Objectives: The White Paper,"" MPs observe that the Government has talked about walking away from a bad deal, ""but has not yet explained what terms would be demonstrably worse for the UK than 'no deal'."" It advises that the Government should therefore ""conduct a thorough assessment of the economic, legal and other implications"" of leaving the EU with no deal in place. It suggests that these findings should then be published. The MPs argue that the public have a right to ""the maximum possible information"" about the impact of the different future trading options, including the possibility of no free trade agreement being reached. The report states: ""Without an economic assessment of 'no deal' having been done and without evidence that steps are being taken to mitigate what would be the damaging effect of such an outcome the Government's assertion that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"", is unsubstantiated."" The committee also suggests that, if the Government fails to reach a deal, Parliament should be given a vote over what happens next. The Government has already been clear that parliament will vote on any future deal, but has not stated what should happen if no agreement is reached. The report states: ""Parliament must be in an informed position to decide whether a proposed deal is, in fact, better or worse than 'no deal'."" However, six members on the committee have refused to agree to the wording of the report. All of them are MPs who supported Brexit. Committee member Dominic Raab, who was one of those who refused to sign up, told Sky News: ""The report was rushed skewed and partisan. After two reports that had strong support, it's regrettable that this one split the committee. ""That undermines its credibility and influence, but I hope and expect the Committee will learn the right lessons, as we move forward."" It comes after a third of the committee left a meeting last week over the drafting of the report - however, Mr Raab denied it had been a ""dramatic walk-out"". He said the committee could get back to working properly together as they had on two previous reports. However, the committee chair Hilary Benn hit back. He told Sky News the report was ""a reasonable, balanced, serious and sober assessment of the Government's negotiating objectives, which we have drawn up after a great deal of evidence and we have to let the evidence speak for itself."" Mr Benn also denied the proposals could lead to Parliament voting to stay in the EU. He said: ""The decision to leave the European Union has been made by British people last summer, this is about the terms in which we leave and the nature of our future relationship."""

They then crossed back into the public area when they were seen by nearby officers, the Met said. The alleged trespass, on Saturday, lasted approximately 30 seconds and the pair did not gain access to any part of the building. :: Terror attack victim: I'm getting stronger Both youths were held at a central London police station and bailed on Sunday, pending further inquiries in May. Scotland Yard said the incident is not being treated as terrorist-related. Security has been tightened around Westminster since Khalid Masood's murderous assault, which left four dead, including police constable Keith Palmer outside the Palace of Westminster almost two weeks ago. The other victims killed were American tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, and college administrator Aysha Frade, 43. More than 35 others were injured, including three police officers."
