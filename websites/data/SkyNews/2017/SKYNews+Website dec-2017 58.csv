2017-12-01,"A review into radiology services across the NHS in England has been launched after it emerged more than 20,000 x-rays at one hospital were not properly examined.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/cancer-cases-missed-as-junior-doctors-left-to-read-x-rays-at-portsmouth-hospital-11150917,"Inspectors at the Care Quality Commission have acted after it emerged junior doctors were left to interpret chest x-rays, including those for suspected cancer, at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. As part of the national review, NHS bodies across the country have been ordered to provide the commission with information on their backlogs, turnaround times, staffing and arrangements for the routine reporting of images. Inspectors discovered three ""serious incidents"" at Queen Alexandra after a member of the public raised concerns, including two where lung cancer had possibly spread because inexperienced doctors were left to look at scans. In both cases, the patients attended as emergency cases and were sent for a chest x-ray, but neither of them got a full radiology report, according to the CQC. In the first case, a junior doctor looked at the x-ray and said ""no abnormality was detected"". But a year later, when the patient was referred by their GP for another examination, a radiologist found lung cancer. The expert said the ""abnormality"" was evident in the first x-ray and should have been spotted then. The second case was very similar, the CQC said, while the third case is still under investigation. Inspectors said: ""The delay in diagnosis caused significant harm to both patients."" The CQC discovered that, starting in 2007, chest x-ray reports started being delegated to the medics who had requested them amid an ""escalating problem with the lack of capacity within radiology"". By the time the CQC got involved, the only chest x-rays that were reviewed by radiologists were ones asked for by GPs, nurses and physiotherapists, as well as x-rays on children. Between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017, 26,345 chest x-rays and 2,167 abdomen x-rays were not looked at by a radiologist or appropriately trained clinician, the CQC found. The trust has been told to take immediate action to make sure x-rays are reviewed by an appropriately trained clinician. CQC's chief inspector of hospitals Professor Ted Baker said: ""When a patient is referred for an x-ray or scan, it is important that the resulting images are examined and reported on by properly trained clinical staff who know what they are looking for - this is a specialist skill. ""During our inspection of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, however, some junior doctors told us that they had been given responsibility for reviewing chest and abdomen x-rays without appropriate training although they felt that they were not competent or confident to do so. ""We then learned of some cases where signs of lung cancer were missed, with serious consequences for the patients involved. This is clearly unacceptable."" Mark Cubbon, chief executive of Portsmouth Hospital NHS Trust, said the hospital had apologised to the families of the three patients concerned and takes the CQC's findings ""extremely seriously"". He said: ""It is of deep regret to all of us that we did not deliver the high standards of care everyone should expect from our hospital."""
2017-12-01,"Lawyers for thousands of current and former Morrisons staff have welcomed a ""landmark"" High Court ruling that the supermarket was partly liable for a data breach that saw their details posted online.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/staff-win-landmark-claim-over-morrisons-data-breach-11151172,"The case, which could have implications for every individual and business in the country, comes after the breach affecting 100,000 employees in 2014. Morrisons said it planned to appeal. The ruling concerns liability and, if it stands, any compensation will have to be assessed at a later date. Andrew Skelton, a senior internal auditor at the retailer's headquarters in Bradford, leaked the workers' payroll data, including names, addresses, bank account details and salaries, by posting it on the internet and sending it to newspapers. Skelton was later jailed for eight years in 2015 after a trial heard he appeared to have been motivated by a grudge against the company. A group of 5,518 former and current Morrisons employees said this exposed them to the risk of identity theft and potential financial loss. They claimed that Morrisons was responsible for breaches of privacy, confidence and data protection laws, and are seeking compensation for upset and distress caused. Their lawyers argued that the company had been awarded £170,000 in compensation against Skelton and that his other ""victims"" should also be compensated. But the supermarket said that it could not be held liable either directly or indirectly for Skelton's criminal misuse of the data and that any other conclusion would be grossly unjust. It also argued that it had already suffered serious damage, having incurred £2m costs relating to the data breach. The judge, Mr Justice Langstaff, ruled that ""vicarious"" or indirect liability, but not primary liability, had been established. However, he said he was ""troubled"" that in reaching his finding against Morrisons he might be helping Skelton ""in furthering his criminal aims"". He therefore granted Morrisons leave to appeal. Nick McAleenan, of JMW Solicitors, representing the claimants, said: ""The High Court has ruled that Morrisons was legally responsible for the data leak. ""We welcome the judgment and believe that it is a landmark decision, being the first data leak class action in the UK."" A Morrisons spokesman said: ""The judge found that Morrisons was not at fault in the way it protected colleagues' data but he did find that the law holds us responsible for the actions of that former employee, whose criminal actions were targeted at the company and our colleagues. ""Morrisons worked to get the data taken down quickly, provide protection for those colleagues and reassure them that they would not be financially disadvantaged. ""In fact, we are not aware that anybody suffered any direct financial loss. ""We believe we should not be held responsible so we will be appealing this judgment."""
2017-12-01,"Jeremy Corbyn's cover shoot for GQ magazine was ""quite torturous"" and ""as difficult as shooting any Hollywood celebrity"", the publication's editor has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/gq-editor-jeremy-corbyn-photoshoot-was-torture-11151403,"The Labour leader is the cover star of GQ's January/February edition, under the headline ""Jeremy Corbyn's hostile takeover"". The 68-year-old joins other famous names such as Liam Gallagher, Alec Baldwin, Cara Delevingne and the Duke of Cambridge to feature on the front of the magazine in recent months. Dylan Jones, who has edited GQ for the last 18 years, has since described the ""very intriguing"" process of navigating the Labour leader's key aides, including his press chief Seumas Milne. ""The actual shoot itself was quite torturous,"" he told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. ""It was as difficult as shooting any Hollywood celebrity. ""We've shot many politicians for our cover... but never have we encountered such a ring. ""Obviously Seumas Milne and his crew are very particular gate-keepers."" Mr Jones suggested the Labour leader's aides ""didn't understand"" that Mr Corbyn would need to be photographed, need to be ""presentable"" and ""couldn't just turn up in his anorak"". ""When he actually turned up for the shoot it was almost like he was being pushed around like a grandpa for the family Christmas photograph,"" he added. ""He wasn't particularly aware of what was going on. But we're very pleased with what we ended up with."" Despite GQ's reputation as a fashion bible for some, Mr Jones revealed the Labour leader was ""adamant"" he wouldn't wear anything other than a Marks & Spencer suit. But Mr Jones, who has previously spoken of being a Tory voter and once wrote a biography of David Cameron, suggested there is an ""air of authenticity"" around Mr Corbyn. In the magazine's interview with him, Mr Corbyn revealed he ""wouldn't dream"" of asking whether his top aide Mr Milne had voted for Brexit or not, despite the Labour leader campaigning for Remain. He also said he would seek a relationship with Vladimir Putin if elected to Downing Street, despite being ""strongly critical"" of the Russian leader's human rights record. Mr Corbyn added he would also meet with US President Donald Trump, in order to ""ask him specifically about some of his views, including the wall in Mexico"". GQ has admitted there was ""minimal retouching"" of Mr Corbyn's cover image, which has been mocked by Tory MPs for its ""stylised"" appearance."
2017-12-01,"The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster risks being a whitewash unless there is a diverse panel to oversee it, Theresa May has been warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-inquiry-risks-being-whitewash-without-diverse-panel-say-families-11151098,"A petition is calling for people from varied backgrounds to sit alongside Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who is heading the inquiry. The campaign has been backed by families of around 50 victims, along with Grenfell United, an association of survivors from Grenfell Tower and nearby Grenfell Walk. The inquiry into the west London disaster, which killed 71 people in June, is being supported by a legal team, civil servants and three assessors who have community work backgrounds to provide advice. Local people have continued to express their misgivings over the appointment of Sir Martin, who they believe lacks first-hand experience of the complex cultural factors surrounding the tragedy. The council-owned block where the fire broke out was home to various social classes, religions and ethnicities. :: Grenfell: Insulation industry awards cancelled following Sky News investigation Adel Chaoui lost four relatives in the blaze - his cousin Farah Hamdan, her husband Omar Belkadi and two of their daughters, eight-year-old Malak and six-month-old Leena. He said: ""It's not about ethnicity. It's nothing to do with whether you're black, white, Arab, whatever - it is to do with experiences. ""Sir Martin is very, very good at what he does, but he does not necessarily understand us.

Sir Martin's decision to appoint three assessors with backgrounds in community work was widely seen as a concession to those concerned about his suitability. The petition is calling on Mrs May to use powers under the Inquiries Act 2005 to make the inquiry panel-led to avoid the risk of losing the support of families and residents. Mr Chaoui warned that unless the format is changed he and others were unlikely to attend the inquiry, which is due to begin hearing evidence in the new year. He added: ""I'm really hoping the Prime Minister sees all we're asking for is a fair crack at justice."" But Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle Hesham Rahman in the fire, believes the appointment of assessors does not go far enough. He said: ""No matter what the assessors recommend, it is up to him what he reports back to the Prime Minister - the fact that that gets left up to one person doesn't seem right, it doesn't give us any confidence."" A government spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister has given a commitment to consider the inquiry panel after the chair determined what further expertise he required, and this process is ongoing. ""We would like to assure all those affected by the tragedy that legal representatives of core participants will receive all relevant evidence, be able to offer opening and closing statements at hearings, and will be able to suggest lines of questioning for witnesses.""

2017-12-01,"The UK's offer on Brexit must be acceptable to Ireland before negotiations can move on, the president of the European Council has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/donald-tusk-uks-brexit-offer-must-be-acceptable-to-ireland-for-talks-to-move-on-11151950,"Donald Tusk said he had given Theresa May a deadline of Monday to make a ""final offer"" on the future Irish border before EU leaders decide if there is ""sufficient progress"" to open a second phase of Brexit talks. The Republic of Ireland has demanded a written guarantee there will be no hard border with Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU. Speaking after meeting Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin, Mr Tusk said: ""Let me say very clearly: If the UK offer is unacceptable for Ireland, it will also be unacceptable for the EU. ""The key to the UK's future lies in some ways in Dublin, at least as long as Brexit negotiations continue."" He added: ""The UK started Brexit, and now it is their responsibility to propose a credible commitment to do what is necessary to avoid a hard border."" Mrs May is due to travel to Brussels on Monday for talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The Prime Minister is hoping EU leaders will give the go-ahead for the next round of Brexit negotiations, including talks on a free trade deal, at the European Council summit on December 14-15. But the leaders of the remaining 27 EU states, including Irish premier Mr Varadkar, have a veto on triggering the second phase of talks, meaning Mrs May must be sure of support from Dublin for progress to be made. Mr Varadkar said:""I want to make progress but I also need to make clear: the EU 27 cannot declare sufficient progress without firm and acceptable commitments on the border and that is a position shared across the political spectrum in Ireland.

The invisible border between the two countries following the 1998 Good Friday Agreement was enabled through the UK and Ireland's joint membership of the EU and its single market. In a report on Friday, MPs warned they ""do not currently see how it will be possible"" to avoid a customs border on the island of Ireland, if the Government pushes ahead with its aim to leave the single market and customs union."
2017-12-01,A picture posted on Facebook has led to the conviction of a man who murdered his stepson in 1968. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/stepdad-david-dearlove-guilty-of-1968-toddler-murder-11151315,"David Dearlove swung 19-month-old Paul Booth by the ankles and smashed his head into a fireplace at the family's home in Haverton Hill, Stockton. The little boy's brother, Peter, who was just three at the time of the killing, saw it happen when he crept downstairs for a drink. He went to police in 2015 when he became incensed after seeing a picture on Facebook of his little brother sitting on Dearlove's knee. Dearlove, who is now 71, had denied killing the toddler, telling a jury at Teesside Crown Court that the little boy had fallen out of bed. He was sentenced on Friday to life in prison, with a minimum term of 13 years, for the murder and an additional three counts of child cruelty. When cross examined in court Dearlove showed little emotion, telling Prosecutor Richard Wright QC that the death of the child was ""probably upsetting"" but that he could not remember his feelings. He had been left alone with Paul on the night of the murder, and had travelled with Mrs Booth to the hospital with the fatally injured child before returning home. Toddler Paul did not regain consciousness and died in hospital four hours after the attack, suffering a fractured skull. Although bruises and burns were also found on the child's body and childcare specialists had voiced concerns, Dearlove was never prosecuted. As the verdict was announced on Friday he did not visibly react, but gasps could be heard from the public gallery where his family sat. His lawyer said 50 years of ""blameless character"" following the murder - in which Dearlove moved to London, married and had two daughters - should be taken into account when sentencing. Dearlove had moved in with Carol Booth and her three children, whom he told the jury he liked but did not love, when he was 21. Peter and his sister Stephanie told the jury he had been physically abusive to them as children. After Dearlove and Carol Booth split in 1970 Peter never saw the stepfather again until facing him in court."
2017-12-01,"Becky Mitchell, a 43-year-old fitness instructor from Bristol, discovered she had been infected with HIV in her late 30s. Here she tells her story: ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/fitness-fanatic-how-i-dealt-with-hiv-face-on-11150830,"I was in a relationship with somebody when I got a message from his ex-girlfriend saying he was HIV positive. He hadn't actually told me and he hadn't been taking his medication properly. I thought I better get myself tested. That's when I found out he had infected me. Before I was diagnosed, I remember feeling really unwell for three weeks. Because I do a lot of training, I'm quite in touch with how I feel. I knew something wasn't quite right and it was more than the flu. I was feeling tired all the time, yet I was sleeping well and eating well. I had no reason to be ill. Initially I thought I had a bad cold or a bit of flu but it went on for quite a long time. I had to wait a month before they could test me properly because the doctors said it might not show up yet. It was 5.30pm on a Friday afternoon in late August when I was diagnosed. I wasn't expecting to get the results then. I'd gone in to see my doctor about something else. The phone rang and it was the people who tested my blood. The doctor came back into the room and said: 'I'm really sorry to have to tell you like this but that was about your blood test. It's come back as positive.' My first reaction question to him was: ""What will happen to me?"" And then I said: ""Well it better not stop me cycling or running. I've got lots of events coming up. I've got no time to be ill!'"" It was hard telling my friends and family. They were all were really worried and upset for me, especially my mum, but really supportive as well. A lot of my friends were surprised that - in their words - something that like could happen to me. I think their perception was you had to be promiscuous or a certain sort of person to catch it and, actually, you don't. My family were devastated but supportive. Early diagnosis meant I could start treatment quite quickly. I remained really fit and well. It's not caused me problems physically. I had worked with someone who was HIV positive so I knew it wasn't a death sentence any more. I could see he was still working and looked active and well and was out walking and doing stuff. It has changed my life because it requires a little bit more thought and consideration. I have to take a pill everyday and remember to do that. I can't be that spontaneous. I have to make sure I have that medication with me all of the time. It terms of a relationships, it hasn't been an issue because I think people see me as sensible and I look after myself. That's my priority. I'm never going to put anyone else at risk and my first priority is looking after myself because I don't want to become unwell. I didn't ask for this in the first place so I'm going to do everything I can to ensure I don't run into any issues. Who knows what's down the road? In terms of the HIV, the treatment works really well and I'm fine. I did a spinning instructor qualification because I was doing a lot of long distance road cycling. Then there came an opportunity to do a fitness trainer qualification. It's led me on to teaching kettle bells and becoming a personal trainer and a run leader. It also helps my mental health. It makes me feel like I'm doing the same things as before. Having HIV hasn't affected my relationships. I'm not in one at the moment but I was for a couple of years and it wasn't an issue. One of the first things the doctor said to me was: ""You'll live a long life but it will be difficult sometimes."" You just have to get used to a bit of uncertainty but life is like that anyway. I know Princess Diana was a big champion of the Terrence Higgins Trust and I'm really pleased Harry is shining a light on it again by visiting its charity fair in Nottingham on World Aids Day. I think it's quite a forgotten topic. People are still subject to stigma. Medication and treatment and science has moved on decades but people's attitudes haven't. I think he's in a good position to help educate more and shine a light on a subject that is still a taboo for some."
2017-12-01,"The Government will tell the EU it wishes to stay in a key aviation safety body, under the indirect jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, in order to keep planes flying after Brexit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/govt-to-stay-in-eu-air-safety-body-in-blurring-of-brexit-red-line-11151049,"Sky News understands the UK will say it wants to remain in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which runs safety and maintenance checks and sets crucial standards across Europe and the UK. It comes after pressure not just from UK and European airlines, but also the key US Federal Aviation Authority, which has told Britain it has weeks to come up with a legal structure for aviation safety, and will be subject to checks by US inspectors. The Department for Transport has been privately reassuring the aviation industry and aeronautical manufacturers that Britain will stay within EASA. A senior source told Sky News the UK's proposal will be modelled as an ""offer"" to the EU, given the Government calculates 40% of the technical expertise behind EASA is from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). One source said: ""It is part of the second phase negotiating process, but it would be bizarre if we couldn't be part of it. ""Plenty of countries outside of the EU are in EASA, although they don't keep voting rights"". Switzerland and Norway are the main non-EU associate members and make budget contributions. But both countries are in the European Free Trade Association and Norway is part of the EU's single market. The Government is exploring Article 66 of EASA regulations, which establishes a clear legal route for third-party country participation. In a future scenario where the UK is an associate member, a domestic dispute over the application of safety regulation would be under the jurisdiction of UK courts. However, under Article 50 of the same EASA rules, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the ultimate arbiter of EASA rulings. Norway and Switzerland have joint committees to allow that jurisdiction to operate indirectly, but it still exists. Some Brexiteer MPs may feel that such jurisdiction oversteps or blurs the Prime Minister's much-heralded ""red line"" of no ECJ jurisdiction after Brexit. But Government sources pointed out it is now ""direct jurisdiction"" that is ruled out once the UK leaves the EU. This could well emerge as a model for other areas, where Theresa May's stance on the ECJ has proven difficult for industries run on a pan-European basis, which see no value in diverging from EU regulations. It is also a possible compromise for the thorny issue of the oversight of EU citizens' rights. Taken to an extreme, this is the basis for the ""Norway model"" of staying in the European Economic Area, for which the ECJ has quasi-direct jurisdiction. More Brexit Forensics: :: Why car industry is worried:: Brexit bill sending UK to constitutional crisis:: How gold takes the shine off Britain's trade balance Captain Mike Vivian, former head of flight operations and chief flight operations inspector at the CAA, told Sky News: ""If you have an alternative system of jurisdiction... if you do that in aviation, you could of course open up different safety standards. ""That would be impossible to accede to, so you have to accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ, which oversees the European agency, EASA, to avoid that happening. ""I can't see there's any way out of that. It's a red line, it seems to me, the Government is going to have to cross."" The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) believes the UK needs to settle the issue of post-Brexit aviation regulation within weeks. Catherine Lang, the FAA's Europe Director, recently said: ""It's very important that we point out that the US-EU safety agreement... when the UK exits the EU, their status in that agreement will be extinguished. ""This is wildly important to mitigate and urgently needed to be mitigated because half of the repair stations in Europe are in the UK."" Some of the big aviation players such as British Airways and Heathrow Airport have been relatively relaxed about the impact of Brexit and the chance of no deal resulting from the UK's exit negotiations. The mutual interest for the European tourist industry and airlines is seen as guaranteeing the avoidance of a ""no deal"" Brexit, although they have said the UK's EASA status needs to be settled imminently. However, smaller providers say they are seeing a divergence of business from smaller airports and less popular routes. Robert Sinclair, the new chief executive of London City Airport, told a Sky News' Brexit Forensics special report on aviation he is ""quite worried about the prospect of no deal"". ""I think for critical industries like aviation, which is an enabler of other industries and trade and tourism, the consequences of 'no deal' are very, very significant,"" he said. ""Single market consistency has driven air fares down, which has made flying the preserve of everyone, not just the few. ""And it's made it a lot more prolific and allowed people right across Britain to experience Europe. ""Unfortunately, if we lose that, the risk is that flying becomes more the preserve of the few, like it was 30 or 40 years ago."" More Brexit Forensics: :: Patients could face medicine shortage:: Can UK avoid the Brexit fallout from leaving Euratom? The head of the European airport trade body, Olivier Jankovec, told Sky News he hopes a ""no deal"" Brexit is ""not the likely outcome"". ""I think we don't know, because we've been asking those questions, we've been begging for contingencies to be put in place, we don't have answers,"" he said. Sky News also understands the Government is preparing an ultimate backstop with plans for a series of legal letters for exchange with airlines in the hour of Britain's departure from the EU; to reassure the maintenance of legal flying rights in the event of no Brexit deal being agreed. It marks the acceptance that absent World Trade Organisation rules - and the fact the EU has dismissed the idea of falling back on decades-old bilateral flight agreements with the UK - means that flights stopping is a possible consequence of a failed Brexit negotiation."
2017-12-01,"Of all people, it was Diego Maradona who picked out England’s ball at a World Cup draw that gave boss Gareth Southgate reasons for optimism.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/englands-excellent-chance-of-making-world-cups-last-16-11152013,"Three decades after his cheat ""Hand of God"" goal helped knock England out of a World Cup, the Argentina legend handed Southgate's men an excellent chance of reaching the last 16 of next summer's tournament. Current rankings suggest that while fifth-placed Belgium will be a very tough nut to crack, Tunisia (27) and Panama (56) should not cause palpitations for England's travelling fans. And the travelling - to Volgograd, Nizhni Novgorod and Kaliningrad - will comfortably avoid the worst scenarios. But as Southgate said in Moscow: ""We've been good at writing teams off and then getting beat."" At the last World Cup, England managed one point from their three games in a group won by underdogs Costa Rica. And a miserable campaign at last summer's European Championship finals ended in ignominious defeat at the hands of Iceland. :: England draw Belgium, Tunisia and Panama in 2018 World Cup group Will this be different? Tunisia have never got past the group stage at four world cups, while this is Panama's debut on the biggest stage. Much depends on whether Southgate can stop his relatively young squad freezing through pressure and fear. They impressed last month - albeit in friendly matches - against world champions Germany and to a lesser extent Brazil. Men like Harry Kane, Deli Alli and Raheem Sterling are coveted by Europe's biggest clubs, and are more than good enough to get England to their final group game against Belgium with qualification for the knockout phase already secured. If they slip up, be afraid. No team in the world would confidently tackle Belgium's star-studded line-up (Kevin de Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard), needing victory to avoid World Cup elimination. And don't even get me started on injuries. May we be spared a Rooney/Beckham build-up dominated by metatarsals. Bookmakers have shortened their odds a little on England winning the competition for the first time since 1966. They are seventh favourites, which is about right. Neither the odds nor the rankings (England are 15th) suggest the nation is likely to have a second cause for celebration, a few weeks after the May wedding of Harry and Meghan. But in a year when no other team from the British Isles qualified for football's big jamboree, England really ought at least to keep home interest alive beyond the opening stages. And what an irony it would be if Maradona's successors in Argentina's colours, featuring the mercurial Lionel Messi, were to go out at the hands of Iceland. Unlikely? That's what England thought last summer."

Mr Mueller and a team of prosecutors are looking into accusations of Russian meddling in last year's presidential election and potential collusion by Mr Trump's campaign. ABC News reported that Mr Flynn was prepared to testify that Donald Trump directed him to make contact with Russians when he was a presidential candidate. The report cited a confidante of Mr Flynn. :: Flynn brings Russia investigation to Trump's door US stock indexes fell following the ABC report. Wall Street has recently been trading at record highs because of plans by President Trump to cut taxes. White House lawyer Ty Cobb said: ""Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn."" Mr Cobb described Mr Flynn as ""a former Obama administration official"" who was only at the White House for ""25 days"". Mr Flynn was charged with being dishonest about contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. When asked in court in Washington whether he wanted to plead guilty, the retired three-star general said: ""Yes sir."" A court paper said Mr Flynn ""did wilfully and knowingly make materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements and representations"". It added that Mr Flynn ""falsely stated and represented to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"" his dealings with the Russian ambassador. Mr Flynn said his guilty plea was ""in the best interests of my family and of our country"". ""I accept full responsibility for my actions,"" he said. The charges related to events late last year, during the transition period between President Obama and President Trump, when the United States imposed sanctions on Russia, and when a United Nations Security Council resolution was pending. Mr Flynn was interviewed by the FBI just days after Mr Trump's inauguration on 20 January, before being forced to resign in February after White House officials claimed he had misled them about whether he had held discussions with Mr Kislyak. Another former senior aide to Mr Trump, Paul Manafort, who ran his campaign for president for several months last year, was charged in October with conspiring to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as a foreign agent of Ukraine's former pro-Russian government. Mr Manafort, who did not serve in Mr Trump's administration, and a business associate who was charged with him, pleaded not guilty. Mr Flynn is the first person who actually worked in the White House to be charged. Mr Trump is said to have taken a particular interest in the Flynn investigation. Former FBI Director James Comey has claimed that during a private meeting in the Oval Office, Mr Trump asked him to consider ending the investigation into Mr Flynn. Mr Comey said he was so unnerved by the meeting that he prepared an internal memo about it. The assertion has been denied by the White House.

James Crewe told the Derby Telegraph: ""It just makes the area look ugly. It doesn't look Christmassy at all because all you can see is metal and fencing. ""You can't even get a decent picture because of it and even if you try and go around the other side you still can't see it properly."" Varvara Dombrovska told the newspaper: ""I wish you could get closer. ""The barriers they've got around the tree are enough. I don't know why they need all of that around it. It would be better for kids if you could get close to it. My daughter wanted to stand next to it but we just couldn't."" A Derby City Council spokesperson initially said the barrier was erected to allow people to view the tree ""at a safe distance"". But following criticism of the fencing, the authority has relented. A spokesperson told Sky News the cordon will be removed, with a fence directly around the tree remaining in place to stop people climbing on it. They said: ""As is the case every year, we review the risk assessments related to the city Christmas decorations based on current health and safety legislation. ""On the basis of that review we decided to increase the security area around the tree. ""However, following feedback from the public, we accept that we have been over cautious and are making alternative arrangements today ahead of the ice rink opening."""

2017-12-01,A former UKIP and Conservative MP has been found guilty of tricking elderly constituents into signing electoral forms that backed local candidates. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/former-mp-bob-spink-found-guilty-of-electoral-fraud-11151828,"A jury at Southwark Crown Court found Bob Spink guilty of four counts of permitting a false signature to be included on a nomination form for a UKIP councillor. Spink, of Benfleet, Essex, failed to tell voters which party he was affiliated with or what the documents were. The 69-year-old served as Tory MP for Castle Point for five years before defecting to UKIP in 2008. People signed the forms without being told they were actually nominating various other UKIP candidates. Instead they were told it was a petition. During a three-week trial prosecutor Tom Nicholson told the court: ""We suggest it is plain that people do not always read what they are asked to sign when canvassed on their doorstep, particularly when someone they know has given them a spiel or patter - I don't mean that in a derogatory way - about something quite different. ""This is particularly the case when the signatories may be of some age, and perhaps not the type to read such a form with scrupulous care - they maybe put an element of trust in him (Spink)."" The jury returned majority verdicts on all four counts faced by Spink. None of the candidates included in Spink's deception won a seat on the council, the court heard. A UKIP election agent for the election, James Parkin, 39, was also found guilty of two counts of the same offence, and found not guilty of three. He had already admitted two counts. Judge Ian Graham said: ""These types of offences are taken very seriously."" Zoe Martin, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said both had ""deliberately misled voters in order to fraudulently secure signatures on nomination forms. ""As a former MP, residents could recognise Spink and were more willing to engage with him. ""But he ultimately betrayed their trust by using their signatures for his own purposes that they had not been made aware of and had not agreed to."" Spink was the MP for Castle Point from 1992 to 1997, and again from 2001 to 2010. Both men will be sentenced in January and were released on bail."
2017-12-01,Hundreds of retail jobs are facing the axe as the stricken toy chain Toys 'R' Us prepares to unveil plans to close a quarter of its British stores.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/hundreds-of-jobs-at-risk-as-toys-r-us-uk-stores-face-closure-11151760,"Sky News has learnt that the board of Toys 'R' Us's UK subsidiary will announce as soon as Monday that it is proposing to launch a process called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). The move, which will require the approval of a 75% majority of the company's creditors, would leave roughly 25 of its 105 British shops facing closure, according to insiders. Toys 'R' Us employs roughly 3200 people in the UK, meaning that a decision to close a quarter of its stores would affect at least several hundred jobs. The precise numbers were unclear on Friday. Sources said that Alvarez & Marsal, a specialist adviser on corporate insolvencies, would handle the CVA proposal. All of the affected Toys 'R' Us shops will remain trading throughout the Christmas period and well into the new year, they added. People close to the process said that Toys 'R' Us's larger out-of-town stores would be disproportionately affected by the closure plan, owing to their weak performance. One said that the warehouse-style stores opened in the 1980s and 1990s were now too big and expensive to run profitably. A CVA is a mechanism enabling companies to organise their funding and operations while enjoying protection from their creditors. It was unclear whether Toys 'R' Us's landlords and other creditors would be prepared to back the proposal, further details of which will become clear next week. In Britain, retailers including BHS, Focus DIY and JJB Sports have all used CVAs to exit loss-making stores, although all three companies ultimately succumbed to the fast-changing retail environment. Toys 'R' Us's UK operations are understood to have been loss-making in seven of the last eight financial years. Accounts for the year to January show turnover of £418m, on which it made an operating loss of £0.5m. The effort to overhaul its UK estate follows the filing by Toys 'R' Us's American parent for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September - a process which shields stricken companies from their creditors while they attempt to restructure their finances. The proposal for the UK business of Toys 'R' Us has emerged on another bleak day for the British high street, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Thomas Cook announcing that they planned to close about 300 of their branches and stores. In addition to those other corporate names, Toys 'R' Us's proposal underlines the extent to which the banking, retail and travel industries are all facing fundamental challenges to their business models from the shift of consumers to digital channels. A spokesman for Toys 'R' Us UK declined to comment."

2017-12-01,"Following her engagement to Prince Harry, the Royal Family have announced that Meghan Markle intends to become a UK citizen.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/becoming-a-brit-what-will-meghan-markle-have-to-do-to-get-uk-citizenship-11147904,"But it requires more than just getting married. For most newlyweds it is a process that takes years, a series of different visas, and tests and checks that can be fiendishly tough. If Ms Markle is following the same process as most non-EEA nationals, marrying Harry will not mean an automatic UK passport: she'll need to apply for a fiancee or spouse visa. :: Harry and Meghan reveal their wedding venue To be granted that, she must meet a range of ""suitability"" criteria, as well as vouching that her and Harry are the real deal, showing they intend to live permanently together in the UK and have a ""genuine relationship"". While Monday's interview has convinced the nation of the couple's affections, some applicants face being quizzed by immigration officers, or providing personal information such as messages and photographs. The betrothed must also meet a minimum income rule, which stipulates that a Briton must earn at least £18,600 a year - or have savings equivalent to £62,500 - to bring their partner to the UK. The fortunes of both Meghan and Harry mean that's not a problem. But the requirement has also been criticised because around 40% of workers in the UK earn less than the threshold. Furthermore, it is thousands higher for people with children, meaning it can result in families being separated. ""It's designed to test people on modest incomes, and people on low incomes obviously won't satisfy that,"" immigration barrister Adrian Berry told Sky News. Partners also need to show they can support their spouse ""without recourse to public funds"", and show evidence they have suitable accommodation that is not overcrowded or dangerous. Luckily for Meghan and Harry, the Royal Family's income is not classed as public funds. Whether he will have to present a tenancy agreement for Nottingham Cottage is unclear. When these criteria are met, it is possible for the non-EEA national to live legally in the UK. But citizenship is still many years away. If the normal rules are in place, Ms Markle can only apply for citizenship after she has had three years of lawful residence in the UK, with indefinite leave to remain. But indefinite leave takes five years to acquire - demanding two separate visas each lasting two and a half years. The cost of this? At the moment it's around £7,000 in fees and processing. But as the bill to the Home Office is increasing by 20% each year it will be more expensive when Ms Markle has reached the end of the process. That's not the end of the process though. To have the status approved there are a few more hoops to jump through - not least the notorious life in the UK citizenship test, requiring the applicant to swot up on about 3,000 facts and 278 historical dates. Ms Markle, who in an interview last year failed to recognise Cockney rhyming slang, may have some revision to do. If that all sounds like too much hard work, there may be a 'get-out clause' for the future royal. ""In exceptional cases they don't have to apply the rules as they do generally,"" immigration expert Mr Berry said. ""And I imagine this may be a case that they judge exceptional""."

The signs include instructions not to feed birds, chase birds, keep dogs on leads and one that says feeding mouldy bread to ducks will poison them.

""I truly have never in my lifetime visited anywhere so bad in this respect."" Dawlish mayor Councillor Martin Wrigley said he took on board the criticism and admitted there were too many signs. Mr Wrigley told Sky News: ""There are simply too many signs and we do need to reduce them and make them more positive. ""I would not say it is the bossiest place. The signs are asking people not to do certain things. ""But there has been a proliferation of the signs in recent years. I hope we will be looking at both reducing the signs and writing them in positive terms. ""For example, encouraging visitors to use duck food that we supply outside our waterfowl enclosure, rather than saying don't feed bread to the birds. Our black swans are a great attraction and people do like to feed them."" Dawlish made the national news when storms destroyed the rail line in the town in 2014."
2017-12-01,"Sadiq Khan has told Sky News he is ""exploring all avenues"" when it comes to the deal West Ham United agreed for the loss-making London Stadium.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/sadiq-khan-exploring-all-avenues-over-west-hams-london-stadium-deal-11151128,"The London Mayor was speaking after announcing a deal to take control of the east London venue in a bid to get a grip on its finances. An independent report on the transformation of the former Olympic stadium into a football ground has found there was a ""catalogue of errors"" which led to massively increased costs. It said that opting for the taxpayer to foot the bill instead of West Ham led to an ""expensive"" and ""onerous"" deal, with the transformation costing £133m more than estimated. The stadium, which is also now used for concerts and athletics, is projected to lose £24m in 2017-18. Speaking to Sky's Dan Whitehead, Mr Khan said he did not fault the Premier League club for not ""looking a gift horse in the mouth"" and agreeing the ""deal of the century"" - paying just £2.5m a year in rent for the 60,000-seat venue. He said: ""We're going to work with West Ham, they're our partners. It's not their fault they were given such a fantastic deal by the previous mayor. Who can blame them?"" Mr Khan added: ""One of the concerns I've got is to make sure we've got a legacy that's not costing the taxpayer money every year."" Mr Khan, who ordered the probe after it was revealed the bill had climbed to £323m, earlier described the report's findings as ""simply staggering"". ""Not for the first time, it reveals a bungled decision-making process that has the previous mayor's fingerprints all over it,"" he claimed. ""Boris Johnson clearly panicked when faced with legal challenges about West Ham and Newham's joint bid to take ownership of the stadium and then decided to re-run the bid process with the taxpayer taking all the risks and footing almost the whole bill. You simply couldn't make it up. ""The fact he also failed to properly examine the transformation costs or the entirely inadequate estimates for moving the retractable seats leaves us squarely in the dire financial situation we are in."" The stadium's post-Olympic legacy has been controversial from the outset, with West Ham involved in a bidding war with London rivals Tottenham Hotspur to become the anchor tenants. West Ham won, agreeing a deal under which they made a one-off contribution of £15m to the conversion costs and pay £2.5m a year in rent. London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), which operates the venue for the Greater London Authority, admitted issues with retractable seating were the biggest cause of the skyrocketing costs. In response to the report, West Ham said the club had ""entered a fair and competitive tender process"" for the stadium and welcomed the mayor's intervention. Their statement added: ""The stadium itself craves renewed leadership and direction and we welcome the mayor's decision to step in and deliver this. West Ham United is firmly behind him."" Sources close to Mr Johnson said he was not to blame for the fiasco. An ally said: ""The mistakes belonged to Khan's Labour predecessor Ken Livingstone and the Blair government. ""Signing off on a stadium fit only for athletics was a massive error. The only option for Boris was conversion to a multi-use venue. ""If Sadiq Khan wants to try and blame someone he should blame his New Labour pals and the old Labour mayor for their catastrophic planning failures."""

2017-12-01,Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 259 branches - a quarter of its network - in a move expected to result in 680 job losses.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171201210709/https://news.sky.com/story/natwest-and-rbs-axe-hundreds-of-branches-and-jobs-11150947,"The group, which remains 72% taxpayer owned after its rescue during the financial crisis, said 62 locations in Scotland under its RBS brand would shut, as well as 197 NatWest sites in England and Wales. It blamed the decision on the increasing shift to online and mobile banking. Trade union Unite accused RBS of ""decimating"" the network and ""betraying communities"". The cuts represent a loss of two-fifths of RBS branches in Scotland, which will fall to 89. In England and Wales the number of NatWest branches will fall to 655. RBS said 1,000 staff had been told their jobs were at risk but that it expects many to be redeployed resulting in a total job loss figure of 680. The bank said it was seeking to manage job losses on a voluntary basis and keep and keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. RBS said that since 2014 the number of customers using branches had fallen by 40% and mobile transactions had increased by 73%. It said more than five million customers now used its mobile banking app and one in five only bank with RBS digitally. The group said it was ""committed to ensuring our customers and communities are able to continue accessing high quality banking services"", pointing to its fleet of mobile branches and contract with the Post Office. Unite's national office Rob MacGregor said: ""Now serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking.""This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities."" High street banks have been cutting swathes of branches over the last few years as customers move online. But the trend has prompted fears for communities being left without a bank in their town and those unfamiliar with the developments of the digital age being cut adrift. RBS had already in March this year announced the closure of 158 branches with the loss of 500 jobs. Scotland's Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the latest announcement was ""hugely concerning"" and that the worst-hit customers would be ""the most vulnerable members of society, for many of whom going into a branch is the only feasible way to conduct their banking"". The announcement comes after the Government last week disclosed plans to dispose of about two-thirds of its stake in RBS, selling off about £15bn a year over five years from 2018/19. RBS has been battling to recover for a decade since the financial crisis and signalled the latest stage of its turnaround by reporting a third quarter in a row of profit earlier this year. But it still expects to report an annual loss for 2017 - its tenth in succession - as it faces an imminent fine from the US Department of Justice over its sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the run-up to the crisis. On Thursday, RBS announced the closure of its so-called ""bad bank"" - the unit set up to dispose of large chunks of unwanted assets following its £45bn taxpayer rescue - marking another chapter in its recovery."
2017-12-02,"Donald Trump has said there is ""nothing to hide!"" over claims of Russian interference, after one of his former advisers admitted lying to the FBI over conversations with Moscow's ambassador to the US.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171202215002/https://news.sky.com/story/absolutely-no-collision-between-trump-campaign-and-russia-us-president-says-11152932,"Mr Trump insisted there was ""absolutely no collusion"" between his campaign team and Russia in the 2016 election in the wake of ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn agreeing to cooperate with a special prosecutor investigating the claims. The President said the retired three-star general had done nothing illegal during the transition in reaching out to Sergey Kislyak, but said he fired him because he lied to vice president Mike Pence and the FBI about doing so. He tweeted: I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide! :: Flynn brings Russia investigation to Trump's door Some analysts have speculated that the President's latest tweet could spark claims he obstructed justice, as it appears Mr Trump has admitted for the first time that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI. At the time of his dismissal, the White House acknowledged only that Flynn had lied to Mr Pence. Former FBI director James Comey has testified that Mr Trump asked him to drop an investigation into Flynn in the wake of the latter being fired. Mr Comey posted a cryptic message on Instagram in the wake of the President's latest comments:  ‪Beautiful Long Island Sound from Westport, CT. To paraphrase the Buddha — Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun; the moon; and the truth. ‬ A post shared by James Comey (@comey) on Dec 2, 2017 at 10:56am PST As part of his plea agreement, Flynn has agreed to co-operate with the probe into alleged Russian meddling led by Robert Mueller, potentially making him a key player in the long-running saga. Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior aide, Jared Kushner, has been named in US media as the ""very senior"" member of the President's transition team who directed Flynn to reach out to Russia. This was in an attempt to delay or defeat a UN resolution on Israeli settlements before Mr Trump took office, according to reports. Court papers suggest senior Trump transition officials were fully aware of Flynn contacting Russian officials in the weeks before January's inauguration. Along with Mr Kushner, another of the officials has been named in US media as former deputy national security adviser KT McFarland. The court documents set out the directions given to Flynn by a Trump transition official about how to interact with Russia regarding sanctions the Obama administration imposed for alleged Russian meddling in the election. Flynn and the official reportedly spoke about ""the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration's foreign policy goals"" and that Flynn then called Mr Kislyak, and ""requested that Russia not escalate the situation"". ABC News reported Flynn would testify that Mr Trump ordered him to reach out to Moscow after last November's presidential election, initially as a way to work together to fight Islamic State in Syria. After a federal court appearance in Washington, Flynn said: ""I recognise that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong. ""My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the special counsel's office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions."" The charge normally carries up to five years in prison but under the terms of a plea deal, Flynn faces a lighter sentence of only up to six months in jail, court filings show."
2017-12-02,Police are renewing their appeals for online shoppers to be careful about where Christmas gifts are being delivered after footage emerged of a parcel theft. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171202215002/https://news.sky.com/story/police-warning-over-festive-period-as-doorstep-thief-caught-in-the-act-11152430,"In the video obtained by Sky News and filmed on a doorbell camera, a van drives up to a property in Surrey and a woman calmly walks up, grabs the package from under a doormat and runs back to the van before it drives off. The victim, who didn't want to be named, said he'd only had the camera system installed a few days before. He was at work when he got an alert on his phone that there was activity at his front door and couldn't believe what had been recorded. He said: ""I was absolutely amazed, it's a busy community with dog walkers and lots of mums around with kids during the day and that someone would be so brazen to do this shocked me quite a lot."" The news comes at the busiest time of the year for online shopping with concerns that this type of theft is on the rise. According to IMRG (Interactive Media in Retail Group), December 2016 saw 143.9 million parcels delivered to online shoppers for Christmas. They predict this year that 175 million parcels will be shipped to customers. Surrey Police who are investigating the incident are urging people to ""arrange delivery for a time when you will be in, or get your parcels sent to a trusted friend or neighbour's house. Alternatively, use a company that will deliver your goods to a store or a convenient pick-up point"". Officers also say: ""If you haven't received a parcel, your first port of call should be the retailer's customer service team - you will have rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. However, if you have CCTV footage or stills of a theft in action, please report it to the police via 101 or report online."" The stolen items in this case were only worth around £10 and were Christmas gifts but the victims are concerned this could be widespread. The owner of the house said: ""The way they did it made me think this is not the first time they've done this. I think they've been doing it a lot in the area. They probably realise that nine out of 10 packages are not worth a lot but there would be other valuable ones that are high-ticket items."""

The little boy's brother, Peter, who was just three at the time of the killing, saw it happen when he crept downstairs for a drink. He went to police in 2015 when he became incensed after seeing a picture on Facebook of his little brother sitting on Dearlove's knee. Dearlove, who is now 71, had denied killing the toddler, telling a jury at Teesside Crown Court that the little boy had fallen out of bed. He was sentenced on Friday to life in prison, with a minimum term of 13 years, for the murder and an additional three counts of child cruelty. When cross examined in court Dearlove showed little emotion, telling Prosecutor Richard Wright QC that the death of the child was ""probably upsetting"" but that he could not remember his feelings. He had been left alone with Paul on the night of the murder, and had travelled with Mrs Booth to the hospital with the fatally injured child before returning home. Toddler Paul did not regain consciousness and died in hospital four hours after the attack, suffering a fractured skull. Although bruises and burns were also found on the child's body and childcare specialists had voiced concerns, Dearlove was never prosecuted. As the verdict was announced on Friday he did not visibly react, but gasps could be heard from the public gallery where his family sat. His lawyer said 50 years of ""blameless character"" following the murder - in which Dearlove moved to London, married and had two daughters - should be taken into account when sentencing. Dearlove had moved in with Carol Booth and her three children, whom he told the jury he liked but did not love, when he was 21. Peter and his sister Stephanie told the jury he had been physically abusive to them as children. After Dearlove and Carol Booth split in 1970 Peter never saw the stepfather again until facing him in court."

2017-12-02,Hundreds of retail jobs are facing the axe as the stricken toy chain Toys 'R' Us prepares to unveil plans to close a quarter of its British stores.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171202215002/https://news.sky.com/story/hundreds-of-jobs-at-risk-as-toys-r-us-uk-stores-face-closure-11151760,"Sky News has learnt that the board of Toys 'R' Us's UK subsidiary will announce as soon as Monday that it is proposing to launch a process called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). The move, which will require the approval of a 75% majority of the company's creditors, would leave roughly 25 of its 105 British shops facing closure, according to insiders. Toys 'R' Us employs roughly 3200 people in the UK, meaning that a decision to close a quarter of its stores would affect at least several hundred jobs. The precise numbers were unclear on Friday. Sources said that Alvarez & Marsal, a specialist adviser on corporate insolvencies, would handle the CVA proposal. All of the affected Toys 'R' Us shops will remain trading throughout the Christmas period and well into the new year, they added. People close to the process said that Toys 'R' Us's larger out-of-town stores would be disproportionately affected by the closure plan, owing to their weak performance. One said that the warehouse-style stores opened in the 1980s and 1990s were now too big and expensive to run profitably. A CVA is a mechanism enabling companies to organise their funding and operations while enjoying protection from their creditors. It was unclear whether Toys 'R' Us's landlords and other creditors would be prepared to back the proposal, further details of which will become clear next week. In Britain, retailers including BHS, Focus DIY and JJB Sports have all used CVAs to exit loss-making stores, although all three companies ultimately succumbed to the fast-changing retail environment. Toys 'R' Us's UK operations are understood to have been loss-making in seven of the last eight financial years. Accounts for the year to January show turnover of £418m, on which it made an operating loss of £0.5m. The effort to overhaul its UK estate follows the filing by Toys 'R' Us's American parent for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September - a process which shields stricken companies from their creditors while they attempt to restructure their finances. The proposal for the UK business of Toys 'R' Us has emerged on another bleak day for the British high street, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Thomas Cook announcing that they planned to close about 300 of their branches and stores. In addition to those other corporate names, Toys 'R' Us's proposal underlines the extent to which the banking, retail and travel industries are all facing fundamental challenges to their business models from the shift of consumers to digital channels. A spokesman for Toys 'R' Us UK declined to comment."
2017-12-02,A retired detective who has claimed Damian Green spent hours looking at pornography on his Commons computer has been accused by a senior police chief of bringing the police service into disrepute.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171202215002/https://news.sky.com/story/former-police-chief-condemns-damian-green-pornography-claim-leak-11153452,"Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, has told Sky News that Neil Lewis's allegation was party political and a breach of confidentiality. Mr Lewis, a former Metropolitan Police detective and IT expert, worked on the notorious police raid on Mr Green's Commons office when he was a shadow Home Office minister in 2008. Mr Green was arrested and held for nine hours after Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith called in the Met's counter-terrorism and security chief Bob Quick after leaks from her private office to the Tory MP. The pornography allegations have been fiercely denied by Mr Green, who claims the story is ""completely untrue"" and that Mr Quick is ""a tainted and untrustworthy source"" pursuing a vendetta against him. But they are being investigated by the Cabinet Office's head of propriety, Sue Gray, along with allegations that Mr Green behaved inappropriately towards journalist and Tory activist, Kate Maltby. Mr Lewis, who worked for Mr Quick, said in an interview that he had been involved in analysing Mr Green's computer and claimed he found pornographic material which ran to thousands of pages. ""I noticed a lot of pornography thumbnails, which indicated web browsing,"" said Mr Lewis. ""I was surprised to see that on a parliamentary computer. I had to take a step back."" Joining a growing backlash against Mr Lewis and Mr Quick, Sir Peter - who was Greater Manchester's police chief for seven years - told Sky News: ""There may be a public interest. ""But I think the public interest in the impartiality of police officers and the public interest in confidentiality of public servants - and particularly police officers - is far, far greater, and that has to weigh in the balance. ""Ultimately it's not for police officers to make judgements about whether politicians are lying or not, ultimately that's a matter for the court. ""And it's not for police officers to make moral judgements about people's lifestyles, whether they're accessing or not accessing perfectly legal material."" Sir Peter added: ""This is exactly the sort of action that can cause disrepute to the police service and I do think the vast majority of police officers and police chiefs will have a concern about this particular case and will have a concern that it could damage the wider reputation of policing, which would be unfair because this is just the actions of two particular retired officers in a particular case. ""I don't feel comfortable and I think most police officers and police chiefs will not feel comfortable. ""It's a very important principle of British policing that policing does not get involved in party politics, and this has become a party political issue. ""The second important principle is one of confidentiality. Often a police officer in an investigation, searching somebody's house, searching somebody's computer, will come across material that is not central to that investigation and it's really important that that is kept confidential. ""So unfortunately these actions breach those two principles, and create the danger of damaging the confidence the public have in the impartiality of police officers. ""It's a breach of the professional ethic and the professional duty which not only applies to police officers but really to any public servant - the same for a doctor perhaps, who came across material. ""At the end of the day this material was not illegal, it's really a matter of a dispute between the employer, Parliament, and the member if staff, this particular MP."" Sir Peter's criticism of Mr Lewis and Mr Quick has been backed by the Met. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: ""Confidential information gathered during a police inquiry should not be made public. ""The appropriate course of action is to co-operate privately with the Cabinet Office inquiry as the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) has done. ""As is routine for cases of this nature the circumstances of information being made public will be looked at by the Directorate of Professional Standards."""
2017-12-02,"Of all people, it was Diego Maradona who picked out England’s ball at a World Cup draw that gave boss Gareth Southgate reasons for optimism.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171202215002/https://news.sky.com/story/englands-excellent-chance-of-making-world-cups-last-16-11152013,"Three decades after his cheat ""Hand of God"" goal helped knock England out of a World Cup, the Argentina legend handed Southgate's men an excellent chance of reaching the last 16 of next summer's tournament. Current rankings suggest that while fifth-placed Belgium will be a very tough nut to crack, Tunisia (27) and Panama (56) should not cause palpitations for England's travelling fans. And the travelling - to Volgograd, Nizhni Novgorod and Kaliningrad - will comfortably avoid the worst scenarios. But as Southgate said in Moscow: ""We've been good at writing teams off and then getting beat."" At the last World Cup, England managed one point from their three games in a group won by underdogs Costa Rica. And a miserable campaign at last summer's European Championship finals ended in ignominious defeat at the hands of Iceland. :: England draw Belgium, Tunisia and Panama in 2018 World Cup group Will this be different? Tunisia have never got past the group stage at four world cups, while this is Panama's debut on the biggest stage. Much depends on whether Southgate can stop his relatively young squad freezing through pressure and fear. They impressed last month - albeit in friendly matches - against world champions Germany and to a lesser extent Brazil. Men like Harry Kane, Deli Alli and Raheem Sterling are coveted by Europe's biggest clubs, and are more than good enough to get England to their final group game against Belgium with qualification for the knockout phase already secured. If they slip up, be afraid. No team in the world would confidently tackle Belgium's star-studded line-up (Kevin de Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard), needing victory to avoid World Cup elimination. And don't even get me started on injuries. May we be spared a Rooney/Beckham build-up dominated by metatarsals. Bookmakers have shortened their odds a little on England winning the competition for the first time since 1966. They are seventh favourites, which is about right. Neither the odds nor the rankings (England are 15th) suggest the nation is likely to have a second cause for celebration, a few weeks after the May wedding of Harry and Meghan. But in a year when no other team from the British Isles qualified for football's big jamboree, England really ought at least to keep home interest alive beyond the opening stages. And what an irony it would be if Maradona's successors in Argentina's colours, featuring the mercurial Lionel Messi, were to go out at the hands of Iceland. Unlikely? That's what England thought last summer."

In a statement, Rush's lawyer said the Pirates of the Caribbean star had not been informed of the nature of the complaint, adding that the STC had chosen to ""smear his name and unjustifiably damage his reputation"" by informing the press about it. Rush, 66, has now stepped down as president of the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) ""until these issues have been resolved"". He said the decision, which comes days ahead of the academy's annual televised awards in Sydney, has ""not been made lightly"".

2017-12-02,The Anglican Cleric at the heart of a dispute over the sexuality of Prince George has issued a statement clarifying his views.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171202215002/https://news.sky.com/story/anglican-minister-clarifies-un-christian-prince-remarks-11152600,"Kelvin Holdsworth became the focus of controversy on Friday after reports he believed Christians should pray for Prince George to be gay to encourage support for same-sex marriage in the Church of England. The comments were drawn from a blog, written more than two years ago, that considered how Christians might support the campaign for gay marriage in the Church of England. When the post was republished this week, however, it attracted attention for a suggestion that ""a royal wedding might sort things out remarkably easily"" with regard to gay marriage. A light-hearted line musing that believers could pray ""for the Lord to bless Prince George with a love, when he grows up, of a fine young gentleman"" provoked the ire of some members of the church community. In his clarification, published on Thursday Mr Holdsworth said it had not been his intention to cause hurt, and expressed regret that the post had led to a focus on the young Prince. ""The post was entirely about the church and its policies around LGBT inclusion,"" he wrote. ""The debate about the church and sexuality will go on. I'm not interested in continuing it through a conversation about Prince George."" Conservative clerics including former chaplain to the Queen Gavin Ashenden had focused on Mr Holdworth's comments. Mr Ashenden told Christian Today that the prayer for the young prince to be gay was ""the theological equivalent of the curse of the wicked fairy in one of the fairy tales"", calling it ""un-Christian"" and ""anti-constitutional"". He also laid out what he and others regard as the correct plans for Prince George's future, saying ""part of the expectation"" the four-year-old ""will inherit is to produce a biological heir with a woman he loves"". Mr Ashenden resigned from the Anglican church this year in opposition to the consecration of women, which he aligned with ""the values of cultural marxism"". LGBT inclusion remains a divisive topic in the Anglican Church which commits to uphold ""marriage between a man and a woman"" and, as a global communion, does not allow gay marriage. However some churches in the global church, including the Scottish Episcopal Church of which Mr Holdsworth is part, have voted to allow same-sex marriage in its churches, with some facing sanctions as a result. Prince George meanwhile expressed a wish for a police car as a Christmas gift, making his request in a letter delivered to Santa Claus by his father."

Sean Spicer It was a short and turbulent tenure, but Sean Spicer's six months of being Donald Trump's press secretary made him a household name and the butt of many late-night TV jokes. Mr Spicer's daily press briefings in which he was grilled by journalists on Mr Trump's actions became must-see TV for millions of Americans. The day after Mr Trump's inauguration Mr Spicer made his first press briefing, contradicting available evidence and claiming the President drew ""the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe"". Senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway later sought to justify his explanation as providing the media with ""alternative facts"", while Mr Spicer himself was forced to apologise, saying he has been given bad information.

Following the revelation, the Prime Minister ordered Ms Patel to return from an official trip to Africa for a meeting in Number 10. In her resignation letter, Ms Patel said it had been a ""tremendous privilege"" to serve in Mrs May's government.

But her return to lead the country's biggest police force has not been without controversy, as she was the officer in charge of the flawed operation which led to the death of Jean Charles de Menezes. He was mistaken for a suicide bomber and shot dead by armed police in 2005. :: Profile of the Met's first female Commissioner   Michel Barnier The EU's chief negotiator on Brexit suggested the UK turned against Europe with the vote to leave, claiming Britons ""chose to be on their own"", and he has repeatedly clashed with Brexit Secretary David Davis during months of negotiations. :: EU's Mr Brexit An 'Accomplished Negotiator' The EU has now cleared the way for Brexit talks with the UK to move onto the second stage, which will involve discussions on their future relationship and trade. But Mr Barnier has already suggested that Britain will be forced to settle for a Canada-style trade deal after Brexit. He claimed in October that the UK's decision to leave the EU's single market and customs union means any future trade relationship will ""have to work on a model that is closer to the agreement signed with Canada"". His comments were a rejection of Theresa May's speech in Florence, in which the PM outlined her wish for a ""comprehensive and ambitious"" EU-UK economic partnership that is superior to Canada's deal.  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is British-Iranian, is serving a five-year jail term after she was accused of trying to topple the Iranian government.

Arlene Foster As a political leader in one of the toughest political landscapes, DUP leader Arlene Foster was always going to drive a hard bargain after agreeing to support Theresa May's government. Northern Ireland's biggest party is said to have extracted billions of pounds of government investment for entering into a confidence and supply deal with the Conservatives after Mrs May's disappointing General Election result over the summer. But it was in the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations when Mrs Foster really showed her mettle, forcing the Prime Minister to abandon a deal with Brussels and enter into another four days of talks.

But after four decades of exploration which have taken in fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn, engineers found that the primary thrusters which orient the space probe had severely degraded. So, in an attempt to keep Voyager 1 operable, NASA tested four thrusters on the back side of the spacecraft which have not been used 1980. After waiting more than 19-and-a-half hours for test results to travel through space and reach an antenna in California, engineers found the dormant thrusters had worked ""perfectly"". NASA now plans to use the trajectory correction manoeuvre thrusters permanently from January - giving Voyager 1 an extra two to three years life. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineer Todd Barber said: ""The Voyager team got more excited each time with each milestone in the thruster test. ""The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all."" JPL chief engineer Chris Jones added: ""The Voyager flight team dug up decades-old data and examined the software that was coded in an outdated assembler language, to make sure we could safely test the thrusters."" NASA says it will likely perform a similar thruster test on Voyager 2, which was launched two weeks before its twin in August 1977 and is on course to enter interstellar space in the next few years. Both plutonium-powered spaceships will continue until they run out of fuel, and will then orbit in the centre of the Milky Way galaxy.

Hundreds of the rugby league faithful gathered in a packed cafe at Leeds Rhinos stadium in Headingley to watch the match on a big screen and they were in party mood. But between the match's heart-stopping moments they were keen to point out what a difference it would have made if rugby union rather than rugby league were taking part in a World Cup final. ""There's definitely a bit of the North-South divide in this,"" said one fan. ""Rugby league is a northern sport and has been unfairly overshadowed for years."" Leeds Rhinos season ticket holders Mick, Jo and Connor Moore were in full agreement. ""If England win this,"" said Jo, ""it would be a tremendous boost for rugby league in this country."" As England played their hearts out on the other side of the world, the tension in Leeds reached sizzling point towards the end of the match. Sadly for England it was not to be. As the Kangaroos celebrated their 6-0 win in the Brisbane Stadium, fan Connor Moore summed up the mood on this side of the planet. ""It's obviously not the result we wanted but England did us proud. If you are flying back home after defeat - this is the best way to do it,"" he said. Rhinos full back Ashton Goldring agreed that England, who were trounced by Australia in their opening match of the tournament, may not have won but certainly did not let their fans down. Whether it makes a difference to rugby league in terms of airtime is uncertain at best. Let's see how much coverage there is when England next get to the World Cup final."

Diana Barren, the charity's chief executive, told Sky News: ""We know that only one in five women will call the police so having support for women in a hospital setting and in a GP setting is really critical to make sure we intervene early for them and their children."" :: Domestic violence victims 'sleeping rough' With many abuse victims regularly attending A&E with mental and physical health problems, they estimate that domestic abuse is costing the NHS £1.76bn a year. Earlier this week the Duchess of Cornwall visited Royal Stoke University Hospital where A&E staff are trained to spot signs of abuse, and IDVAs are on hand to help the patient. Through her charity work Camilla supports a number of organisations set up to support abuse victims and sexual violence. During her visit to Stoke she met Rachel Williams, who for six years has been campaigning on the issue of domestic violence. Ms Williams told Sky News: ""Back in 2011 I left my husband of 18 years, which resulted in him coming to my place of work and shooting me with a sawn-off shotgun and he went off and hanged himself. Then six weeks later my 16-year-old son committed suicide, so that's the sort of, aftermath and ripple effect of this epidemic we've got."" In a statement the Home Office said: ""Last year the Government committed increased funding of £80m to stop violence against women and girls, launching a new strategy to stop physical abuse with early intervention and prevention. A further £20m for domestic abuse services was announced in the Spring Budget. ""Independent Domestic Violence Advisers (IDVAs) play a crucial role in protecting victims across the UK. Under this Government, the number of IDVAs have more than doubled since 2010."" Safelives also found that over 50,000 NHS staff are dealing with domestic abuse themselves. John and Penny Clough's daughter Jane was a nurse. She was murdered by her ex-partner who was on bail awaiting trial for raping her. Her parents now campaign for better support in the workplace for victims. Mr Clough said: ""The hospital she worked at Blackpool was very supportive. They did put some special measures in place to try and keep her safe as she travelled from home to work. ""Unfortunately the measures didn't work, but it was a start and we've worked with Blackpool Victoria hospital over the years and they've now developed a policy to support their staff as well as possible."" Mrs Clough added: ""What we can do is keep the victim as safe as possible in the workplace, the research is there to say by supporting the victim it is a win for the workplace but it's also a win for the victim, so why not do it."""

2017-12-02,It was all smiles at the press conference in Dublin as Ireland's Leo Varadkar got the very public backing of one of the EU's biggest hitters in his show of brinkmanship with Theresa May.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171202215002/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-irish-border-derail-progress-on-brexit-11152347,"The Taoiseach has threatened to veto what Mrs May wants - to move on to negotiating a trade deal with the European Union in just two weeks' time - unless firm assurances are given that there will be no ""hard border"". Donald Tusk, the European Council President stood alongside him, appeared to acquiesce declaring that the ""UK's future lies in some ways in Dublin"". Is this one in the eye then from our closest ally, or is this row not quite what it seems? The EU-27 must agree that ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the three key issues next week - EU citizens, money and the border - in order to move on to the next phase of negotiations, so clearly the clock is ticking. Mrs May is trapped between a rock and hard place because if Britain does leave the single market and customs union as she intends, it is hard to see how the UK's only land border with the EU - between Ulster and the Republic - can stay as it is. Indeed the Commons Brexit Committee, whose report into this issue was published on Friday morning, came to the conclusion that a return to border checks was inevitable - although it was not backed by all the MPs. :: Donald Tusk: UK's Brexit offer must be acceptable to Ireland for talks to move on The suggestion floated last week that the Government might get around this by allowing Northern Ireland the powers to have different customs regulations to the rest of the UK has triggered fury from the Democratic Unionist Party. Their 10 MPs at Westminster keep Mrs May in power, and they have made clear that any such move could see them withdraw support from her fragile administration. However unlikely it may seem that the Unionists would bring her - and their best chance of achieving Brexit - down and run the risk of propelling Jeremy Corbyn to power; senior DUP sources insist this is a real deal-breaker. For Mr Varadkar, this is also the natural moment to push Westminster hard. He also presides over a minority administration and needs to assert his authority. The UK Government has, after all, already caved in on the issue of the Brexit bill in the past week. It seems like deadlock. The DUP would veto what the party see as a border in the Irish Sea, while the Republic effectively wants Britain to stay in the customs union. The border, established in 1921, runs for 310 miles and has more than 200 public roads crossing it. The prospect of a hard border, with customs checks to enforce the tariffs which would be needed if Britain leaves the EU's customs arrangements, is not just a logistical and trade issue but would undermine the basis of the 1998 peace agreement. This issue is not going to be settled finally in the next few days, and No 10 sources say they see the border entwined with trade issues which can only be fully resolved when the talks move on to the next phase. Can Mrs May find a fudge acceptable to both sides, which would give Ireland the assurances it is seeking on the border and keep the UK Government's options open on a customs deal? Belfast is heavily reliant on trade with the rest of the UK and for Dublin, the economic consequences of a ""no deal"" Brexit could be ruinous. Behind the scenes, both the Irish government and Westminster will have to give ground. Both believe an agreement is do-able, but this fraught issue has raised the stakes uncomfortably high."

It is scheduled to last five days and comes less than a week after the rogue state's latest intercontinental ballistic missile test, which Pyongyang claimed was capable of hitting the US mainland. In an editorial on Sunday, North Korea's ruling party Rodong newspaper said the US-South Korea drill was ""an open, all-out provocation"" and that it ""may lead to a nuclear war at any moment"". :: US 'scouting' for west coast anti-missile sites amid fears over North Korea The piece - which came shortly after leader Kim Jong Un visited a military tyre factory - added: ""The US and South Korean puppet warmongers would be well advised to bear in mind that their DPRK-targeted military drill will be as foolish as an act precipitating their self-destruction."" Mr Kim's factory trip saw him thank workers who had built the tyres for the huge vehicle used to transport the tested Hwasong-15 missile this week, which had prompted a public rally and fireworks in Pyongyang as the country continued to flout international sanctions. North Korea has been eligible for even harsher sanctions since US President Donald Trump declared it a designated state sponsor of terrorism last month, and White House National Security Advisor HR McMaster has admitted the newspaper editorial's warning of war was credible. :: US: North Korea would be 'utterly destroyed' in war ""I think it's increasing every day, which means that we are in a race to be able to solve this problem,"" he said at a forum on Saturday. ""There are ways to address this problem short of armed conflict, but it is a race because he's getting closer and closer, and there's not much time left."" Meanwhile, the US agency tasked with protecting America from missile attacks is reportedly scouting the West Coast for places to deploy new anti-missile defences. Two congressmen have claimed the defences would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack."

2017-12-03,"We send 96 billion text messages every day in the UK but the very first, sent 25 years ago today, was pretty simple: ""Merry Christmas.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171203224325/https://news.sky.com/story/first-text-message-sender-neil-papworth-celebrates-25th-sms-anniversary-11154491,"""Spelt with the full words - not Xmas,"" says Neil Papworth, the British engineer who sent it, eschewing the abbreviations that would define the medium. That first SMS (it stands for short message service) wasn't even sent on a mobile phone. Handsets could only receive messages, not send them, so Mr Papworth typed out the season's greetings on a computer. ""I don't know if they really thought it was going to be a big thing,"" Mr Papworth says. :: Neil Papworth: It's been an entire generation since I sent that message It took a while for texting to catch on. SMS-capable phones were only just available in 1993, but as mobile phones became more popular, texting skyrocketed. By 2007, we were sending 66 billion SMS messages a year in the UK; in 2012, we sent 151 billion. The US was slower to catch on, mainly because mobile operators there charged more for texts and less for voice calls, and because of the popularity and availability of PC-to-PC instant messaging or IM. And perhaps because they missed that initial adoption, Americans still don't add the customary 'x' at the end of a message. The first SMS was ""an incredibly important development in the history of mobile telephones"", according to Elizabeth Bruton, curator of technology and engineering at the Science Museum in London. It was when phones, around for more than a century, moved beyond mere audio. ""For the very first time we have mobile telephones that were more than just literal mobile telephones, moving beyond voice communications to a new application of the mobile spectrum - to sending, literally, text messages. ""And we can see that continuation through to today when we have hundreds of thousands of applications on our smartphone. So SMS can be considered the first step towards the modern smartphone."" SMS changed norms of social interaction. Rather than calling someone - interrupting them and demanding their attention right that moment - it let people choose when to reply. It pioneered one-to-many communication - you could send the same message to many different contacts. When Twitter launched in July 2006, it borrowed SMS's 140 character limit. But 2012 proved the peak for text messages, in terms of volume; they've been superseded by internet-based apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and iMessage. In 2015, 30 billion messages were sent every day globally on WhatsApp, compared to 20 billion sent via SMS. That also marked a more fundamental shift, away from an open standard which anyone could use (even if your operator charged you) to closed messaging systems controlled by technology giants. SMS still has a future, though, ""because it works where very few data standards will work,"" Ms Bruton says. ""You don't need Wi-Fi, you don't need 3G to be able to send a very basic text message."" Happy birthday SMS xx."
2017-12-03,"The Government is doing a ""massive amount"" to increase Britons' life chances despite the entire board of the Social Mobility Commission quitting over a lack of progress, a senior minister has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171203224325/https://news.sky.com/story/justine-greening-rejects-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburns-attack-11154882,"Education Secretary Justine Greening admitted the Government has a ""long, long way to go"" in improving social mobility, but rejected a stinging attack on ministers' performance. Former Labour minister Alan Milburn, the chairman of the Social Mobility Commission, has led a top-level walkout from the Government watchdog and now plans to set up his own institute. He has claimed there is ""little, if any, hope"" of Theresa May achieving her much-heralded ambition of creating ""a country that works for everyone"", as she declared in her first speech as Prime Minister. Downing Street has insisted Mr Milburn's term as the Government's social mobility tsar came to an end in July, with the ex-MP informed of Mrs May's plans to appoint a new chair of the cross-party commission. Mr Milburn revealed he will not be applying again for the role, and neither will his three fellow board members, as he claimed Brexit has left ministers without the ""bandwidth"" to tackle inequality. Speaking to Sky News' Sunday With Niall Paterson programme, Ms Greening confessed she was ""sorry"" Mr Milburn was ""taking the action he's taking"" but disagreed with his assessment of the Government's performance. Outlining a need to ""get some fresh talent"" into the commission, the Cabinet minister said: ""I don't agree that we're not taking significant steps across Government because we absolutely are. ""And we are seeing the fruit of that effort already bearing results. ""If you look at the attainment gap, in other words the difference between how well more disadvantaged children do compared to their better-starting peers, actually that's closing now in schools. ""So we're moving in the right direction. But as Alan sets out today, quite rightly, there's a very long way to go. ""We need to really make sure the fruits of these reforms are being felt in the communities where we need to see change happen the most."" Ms Greening did not deny Mr Milburn's suggestion she had personally pushed for his term to be extended by Number 10. Explaining his decision to stand down and deliver a withering verdict of Mrs May's Government, Mr Milburn told Sky News: ""The Government, perhaps understandably, has focused on Brexit and simply lacks the bandwidth to be able to translate the rhetoric of healing social division and progressing social justice into reality. ""I'm afraid I've reached the conclusion that there's only so much you can do to push water uphill."" There is ""no doubt"" the Prime Minister has a ""personal sense of social justice"", Mr Milburn said, but added: ""The question in politics is not what you say, it's what you do."" He attacked a lack of planning, ambition and leadership from the Government. One of Tony Blair's closest political allies while in Cabinet, Mr Milburn was reported last year to have been leading efforts to form a campaign to reverse Britain's departure from the EU. Asked whether Brexit will make social mobility worse, Mr Milburn said: ""It's all too easy for people who oppose Brexit - and, by the way, personally I do - to rail against the people who voted for it. ""But there's an interesting correlation. Of the 65 parts of the country that the commission says are the worst for getting a good school, getting a decent job, getting on the housing ladder, only five of those areas voted to Remain. ""You can feel the sense of political alienation and social resentment in those parts of the country. ""It's understandable why people voted for Brexit. ""It's fine to be tough on Brexit, but we've got to be tough on the causes of Brexit."" Mr Milburn said there is ""sense"" to parts of Labour's policies, but added: ""I'm not going to endorse Jeremy Corbyn any more than I'm going to endorse Theresa May."" Commenting on Mr Milburn's departure, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested last month's Budget could have been ""the last straw"" as he cited a lack of action on education budgets. ""I can understand the frustration that Brexit is dominating the agenda but nothing else has moved either,"" he told Sky News."

""He has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a road traffic collision.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described it as ""an ambitious attempt"" to transform the treatment of young people. The plans include access to mental health support in schools and colleges, which will work in partnership with the NHS. Mr Hunt said: ""Every school will have a senior mental health lead, who will be trained to understand what someone's mental health condition might be and the help they might need. ""Then we will set up a programme to help people with mild to moderate needs get help quickly and early. But also for the people with severe mental health needs we will make sure that the NHS wait is much shorter."" The Government is promising an extra £300m over the next three years to fund the proposals. The idea is to try to ensure more children and young people with mental health problems are identified and treated as early as possible. Education Secretary Justine Greening said that some schools currently have to tackle mental health ""a bit more independently than we would like"". :: 150 children a day being denied mental health treatment ""Over time we can start to build a better evidence base,"" she said, ""particularly around prevention and mild to moderate mental health conditions, how we treat those effectively and critically how schools can work with hospitals and the health service better. ""The first trailblazer areas will be over the next two years. They will be in place by 2019 and by the end of this Parliament we are hoping that 25% of children's schools will be able to get these better connections into the health service."" There is some scepticism around the plans, however, in light of NHS waiting time targets already being failed in some areas. Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the money being put forward simply is not enough. ""I would give the Government more credit if they hadn't cut both services in the way that they have,"" she said. ""Many people listening to the programme will know that actually services are really overstretched and children are waiting years for that vital support. ""So this is a drop in the ocean compared to the cuts that services have faced."" Around half of all mental health issues are established before the age of 14. Twenty-two-year-old Jodie Goodacre was eight when she first started having problems and has since been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. She told Sky News earlier intervention could have changed her life. ""Having early intervention would have helped. I would have known better methods to manage the emotional pain I was going through and I would have known I wasn't alone. ""That was one of the main things for me thinking that I was the only person in the world going through this, and that I was weird for it."" Other proposed measures included ensuring that every primary and secondary school is offered mental health awareness training, and commissioning further research into how to better support vulnerable families. Charities are welcoming the plans but also questioning the detail. Mark Bush from Young Minds said: ""Four weeks is already a long time to wait, and families will be asking what does that four weeks mean? Four weeks until assessment? Four weeks from assessment to treatment? ""Because in that time people's needs are going to escalate and what we don't want is more children in crisis in our community."" The consultation on the preliminary paper will run for around 12 weeks, with a number of round table discussions run by the Department of Health and Department for Education."
2017-12-03,A retired detective who has claimed Damian Green spent hours looking at pornography on his Commons computer has been accused by a senior police chief of bringing the police service into disrepute.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171203224325/https://news.sky.com/story/former-police-chief-condemns-damian-green-pornography-claim-leak-11153452,"Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, has told Sky News that Neil Lewis's allegation was party political and a breach of confidentiality. Mr Lewis, a former Metropolitan Police detective and IT expert, worked on the notorious police raid on Mr Green's Commons office when he was a shadow Home Office minister in 2008. Mr Green was arrested and held for nine hours after Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith called in the Met's counter-terrorism and security chief Bob Quick after leaks from her private office to the Tory MP. The pornography allegations have been fiercely denied by Mr Green, who claims the story is ""completely untrue"" and that Mr Quick is ""a tainted and untrustworthy source"" pursuing a vendetta against him. But they are being investigated by the Cabinet Office's head of propriety, Sue Gray, along with allegations that Mr Green behaved inappropriately towards journalist and Tory activist, Kate Maltby. Mr Lewis, who worked for Mr Quick, said in an interview that he had been involved in analysing Mr Green's computer and claimed he found pornographic material which ran to thousands of pages. ""I noticed a lot of pornography thumbnails, which indicated web browsing,"" said Mr Lewis. ""I was surprised to see that on a parliamentary computer. I had to take a step back."" Joining a growing backlash against Mr Lewis and Mr Quick, Sir Peter - who was Greater Manchester's police chief for seven years - told Sky News: ""There may be a public interest. ""But I think the public interest in the impartiality of police officers and the public interest in confidentiality of public servants - and particularly police officers - is far, far greater, and that has to weigh in the balance. ""Ultimately it's not for police officers to make judgements about whether politicians are lying or not, ultimately that's a matter for the court. ""And it's not for police officers to make moral judgements about people's lifestyles, whether they're accessing or not accessing perfectly legal material."" Sir Peter added: ""This is exactly the sort of action that can cause disrepute to the police service and I do think the vast majority of police officers and police chiefs will have a concern about this particular case and will have a concern that it could damage the wider reputation of policing, which would be unfair because this is just the actions of two particular retired officers in a particular case. ""I don't feel comfortable and I think most police officers and police chiefs will not feel comfortable. ""It's a very important principle of British policing that policing does not get involved in party politics, and this has become a party political issue. ""The second important principle is one of confidentiality. Often a police officer in an investigation, searching somebody's house, searching somebody's computer, will come across material that is not central to that investigation and it's really important that that is kept confidential. ""So unfortunately these actions breach those two principles, and create the danger of damaging the confidence the public have in the impartiality of police officers. ""It's a breach of the professional ethic and the professional duty which not only applies to police officers but really to any public servant - the same for a doctor perhaps, who came across material. ""At the end of the day this material was not illegal, it's really a matter of a dispute between the employer, Parliament, and the member if staff, this particular MP."" The Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Thomas Winsor, also said the leak should never have happened, adding police have an ""enduring"" duty of confidentiality - even after they left the service. Sir Peter's criticism of Mr Lewis and Mr Quick has been backed by the Met. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: ""Confidential information gathered during a police inquiry should not be made public. ""The appropriate course of action is to co-operate privately with the Cabinet Office inquiry as the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) has done. ""As is routine for cases of this nature the circumstances of information being made public will be looked at by the Directorate of Professional Standards."""

2017-12-03,The Anglican Cleric at the heart of a dispute over the sexuality of Prince George has issued a statement clarifying his views.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171203224325/https://news.sky.com/story/anglican-minister-clarifies-un-christian-prince-remarks-11152600,"Kelvin Holdsworth became the focus of controversy on Friday after reports he believed Christians should pray for Prince George to be gay to encourage support for same-sex marriage in the Church of England. The comments were drawn from a blog, written more than two years ago, that considered how Christians might support the campaign for gay marriage in the Church of England. When the post was republished this week, however, it attracted attention for a suggestion that ""a royal wedding might sort things out remarkably easily"" with regard to gay marriage. A light-hearted line musing that believers could pray ""for the Lord to bless Prince George with a love, when he grows up, of a fine young gentleman"" provoked the ire of some members of the church community. In his clarification, published on Thursday Mr Holdsworth said it had not been his intention to cause hurt, and expressed regret that the post had led to a focus on the young Prince. ""The post was entirely about the church and its policies around LGBT inclusion,"" he wrote. ""The debate about the church and sexuality will go on. I'm not interested in continuing it through a conversation about Prince George."" Conservative clerics including former chaplain to the Queen Gavin Ashenden had focused on Mr Holdworth's comments. Mr Ashenden told Christian Today that the prayer for the young prince to be gay was ""the theological equivalent of the curse of the wicked fairy in one of the fairy tales"", calling it ""un-Christian"" and ""anti-constitutional"". He also laid out what he and others regard as the correct plans for Prince George's future, saying ""part of the expectation"" the four-year-old ""will inherit is to produce a biological heir with a woman he loves"". Mr Ashenden resigned from the Anglican church this year in opposition to the consecration of women, which he aligned with ""the values of cultural marxism"". LGBT inclusion remains a divisive topic in the Anglican Church which commits to uphold ""marriage between a man and a woman"" and, as a global communion, does not allow gay marriage.

2017-12-03,"Donald Trump has claimed the FBI's reputation is ""in tatters"" and at its lowest point in history amid questions over his sacking of a former national security adviser.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171203224325/https://news.sky.com/story/trump-deflects-attention-amid-questions-over-whether-he-knew-ex-security-adviser-michael-flynn-lied-to-fbi-11154637,"The US President is facing claims he obstructed justice after appearing to confirm for the first time that he knew ex-adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI over conversations with Moscow's ambassador to the US. Responding to allegations he attempted to pressure ex-FBI director James Comey ""to let Flynn go"" after learning that the retired general made false statements to agents, Mr Trump said he ""never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn"". In a series of tweets, the President attacked the intelligence agency's reputation and said it was a case of ""fake news covering another Comey lie"". He said: ""After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in tatters - worst in history! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness."" On Saturday, the President tweeted that he had fired Flynn ""because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI"" - however at the time of the dismissal the White House acknowledged only that Flynn had lied to VP Mike Pence. Amid questions over the admission he then attempted to shift the focus on to Hillary Clinton, describing his former election opponent as ""crooked"" and suggesting either a ""rigged system"" or ""double standard"" prevented her from further FBI investigation. Sources close to Mr Trump distanced the President from his tweet describing why he sacked Flynn, saying it was ""crafted"" by John Dowd, one his personal lawyers. Mr Dowd declined to comment on the claim, but said the post ""was a paraphrase"" of an FBI statement released after Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI. After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness. Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE”  Now it all starts to make sense! In the wake of the President's comments on Flynn, Mr Comey posted a cryptic message on Instagram which read: ""Three things cannot be long hidden: the Sun; the Moon; and the truth."" Meanwhile, senior Democrats tore apart Mr Trump's account of why he sacked the former national security adviser. Congressman Ted Lieu tweeted: ""THIS IS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. @POTUS now admits he KNEW Michael Flynn lied to the FBI. Yet Trump tried to influence or stop the FBI investigation on #Flynn. ""Trump's folks are so freaked out by @realDonaldTrump tweet that establishes Obstruction of Justice that they are trying to blame lawyer Dowd. If true, they should fire him for malpractice. But it doesn't absolve Trump. If lawyer drafts X & I say X, then I have adopted X as my own."" Fellow California congressman Adam Schiff asked the President that if he knew Flynn lied ""why did you fail to act until his lies were publicly exposed? ""And why did you pressure Director Comey to 'let this go?'"" Court filings show Flynn faces six months in jail after agreeing a plea deal. The charge he pleaded guilty to carries a maximum sentence of five years. As part of the plea agreement, Flynn has agreed to co-operate with the probe into alleged Russian meddling led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Trump told reporters on Saturday he was not worried about what Flynn may tell prosecutors, adding there was ""absolutely no collusion"" between his campaign team and Russia in the 2016 presidential election."

Including interns on exchange programmes. ""For the officer on @BBCNews just now to claim that the computer on Greens desk was accessed and therefore it was Green is utterly preposterous!!"" Mr Green is facing an accusation by a retired detective that he spent hours looking at pornography on his Commons computer. Ms Dorries' comments on social media were picked up swiftly by the IT security community, one of which tweeted that it was a ""cavalier attitude to data security"". My staff log onto my computer on my desk with my login everyday. Including interns on exchange programmes. For the officer on @BBCNews just now to claim that the computer on Greens desk was accessed and therefore it was Green is utterly preposterous !! All staff send emails in our name. To say emails were sent at the same time porn was viewed - therefore it must have been him - is also preposterous Data protection officer Carl Gottlieb told Sky News: ""Sharing access to confidential systems should always be minimised, especially in Government where security and audit trails are paramount. MPs and the civil service have a track record of lax practices around sharing passwords and this needs to change. ""MPs, like many senior managers, have team around them that act as a bubble of trust. Interns are trusted to handle their email and social media accounts on a daily basis. ""This usually works well, until eventually the bubble bursts, and previously-trusted personnel make mistakes or go rogue. ""Edward Snowden was the greatest example of this, with his NSA colleagues trusting him with their passwords, leading to the biggest breach in security the world has ever seen."" Ms Dorries responded to criticism on Twitter by saying that this is common practice for MPs who receive hundreds of emails from constituents every day, but House of Commons handbook rules state: ""Staff must not share passwords"". She later told Sky News: ""I'm a backbench MP with four staff working on two computers. I don't get top secret emails from government."""

I do so with much sadness. I was appointed Chair by the Coalition Government in 2012 and my term of office has come to an end. I understand the current government will launch an open process for a new Chair in 2018. I will not beapplying. I am deeply proud of the work the Commission has done to champion the case for greater fairness in Britain. Our research and advocacy work has helped put social mobility at the heart of the national debate about the future of our country. All the main political parties now espouse a Britain that is less elitist and more equal, while growing numbers of employers, universities, colleges, schools and councils have developed a shared determination to create a level playing field of opportunity in our country. I would like to pay tribute to my vice-chair Gillian Shephard for her outstanding work over the last few years: similarly, my fellow Commissioners Paul Gregg and David Johnston. They have all been a joy to work with. From the outset, all have discharged their role as Commissioners in a non-partisan way. I would also like to thank the Secretariat team that have supported us throughout. The cross-party and independent nature of the Commission has been one of its great strengths. For almost a decade, I have been proud to serve under Labour, Coalition and Conservative governments in various social mobility roles. I remain deeply committed to the issue, but I have little hope of the current government making the progress I believe is necessary to bring about a fairer Britain. It seems unable to commit to the future of the Commission as an independent body or to give due priority to the social mobility challenge facing our nation. It is disappointing, and indeed puzzling, that appointments to key Commission roles have been left vacant for almost two years. Nor do the protracted discussions about its role, remit and resourcing show any sign of being resolved. Individual ministers such as the Secretary of State for Education have shown a deep commitment to the issue. But it has become obvious that the government as a whole is unable to commit the same level of support. It is understandably focused on Brexit and does not seem to have the necessary bandwidth to ensure that the rhetoric of healing social division is matched with the reality. I do not doubt your personal belief in social justice, but I see little evidence of that being translated into meaningful action. The need for political leadership in this area has never been more pressing. Social mobility is one of the biggest challenges facing our country today. It is not just the poorest in society who are losing out. Whole communities and parts of Britain are being left behind economically and hollowed out socially. The growing sense that we have become an us and them society is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a nation. As the Commission's work has demonstrated, the twentieth century expectation that each generation would do better than the last is no longer being met. At a time when more and more people are feeling that Britain is becoming more unfair rather than less, social mobility matters more than ever. While the government seems unable to devote the necessary energy and focus to the social mobility agenda, I have been heartened that others in civil society - from local councils to major employers - are actively embracing it. So I will be establishing a new Social Mobility Institute, independent of government and political parties, to take forward the practical work that is needed to make a reality of my belief in a fairer, more open, more mobile society in Britain. Yours sincerely Alan Milburn"
2017-12-03,A charity that supports victims of domestic violence believes that fewer than 50 hospitals in England and Wales have specialist professionals on site to help those who are being abused at home.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171203224325/https://news.sky.com/story/domestic-violence-vital-opportunities-being-missed-says-charity-11152346,"Safelives is calling for more independent domestic violence advisers, known as IDVAs, to be based within the health service and believes without them too many vital opportunities are being missed to help those in need of support. Diana Barren, the charity's chief executive, told Sky News: ""We know that only one in five women will call the police so having support for women in a hospital setting and in a GP setting is really critical to make sure we intervene early for them and their children."" :: Domestic violence victims 'sleeping rough' With many abuse victims regularly attending A&E with mental and physical health problems, they estimate that domestic abuse is costing the NHS £1.76bn a year. Earlier this week the Duchess of Cornwall visited Royal Stoke University Hospital where A&E staff are trained to spot signs of abuse, and IDVAs are on hand to help the patient. Through her charity work Camilla supports a number of organisations set up to support abuse victims and sexual violence. During her visit to Stoke she met Rachel Williams, who for six years has been campaigning on the issue of domestic violence. Ms Williams told Sky News: ""Back in 2011 I left my husband of 18 years, which resulted in him coming to my place of work and shooting me with a sawn-off shotgun and he went off and hanged himself. Then six weeks later my 16-year-old son committed suicide, so that's the sort of, aftermath and ripple effect of this epidemic we've got."" In a statement the Home Office said: ""Last year the Government committed increased funding of £80m to stop violence against women and girls, launching a new strategy to stop physical abuse with early intervention and prevention. A further £20m for domestic abuse services was announced in the Spring Budget. ""Independent Domestic Violence Advisers (IDVAs) play a crucial role in protecting victims across the UK. Under this Government, the number of IDVAs have more than doubled since 2010."" Safelives also found that over 50,000 NHS staff are dealing with domestic abuse themselves. John and Penny Clough's daughter Jane was a nurse. She was murdered by her ex-partner who was on bail awaiting trial for raping her. Her parents now campaign for better support in the workplace for victims. Mr Clough said: ""The hospital she worked at Blackpool was very supportive. They did put some special measures in place to try and keep her safe as she travelled from home to work. ""Unfortunately the measures didn't work, but it was a start and we've worked with Blackpool Victoria hospital over the years and they've now developed a policy to support their staff as well as possible."" Mrs Clough added: ""What we can do is keep the victim as safe as possible in the workplace, the research is there to say by supporting the victim it is a win for the workplace but it's also a win for the victim, so why not do it."""

Samuel was discovered on the hard shoulder of the M67 eastbound at junction 3 in Hyde, Greater Manchester, during the Friday afternoon rush hour. He was taken to hospital where he died early on Saturday. A grey convertible BMW, which had been travelling eastbound and stopped at the scene, was involved in the collision. In a statement, police said the teenager was a talented footballer who had recently started playing for Hattersley FC. He attended Audenshaw School in his local area and had recently become an uncle to his older brother's new baby. His family said they were heartbroken and hoped everyone would remember Sam for the fun, outgoing and friendly boy he will always be. Mark Hunt, deputy chairman of Hattersley Football Club, said: ""This is probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my role at this club and it is written with a heavy heart. ""Yesterday afternoon one of our under-15s Jets players was involved in a collision on the M67 and has sadly passed away in the early hours. ""The player is Sam Berkley who I have met several times and a nicer lad you could never meet, myself and everyone at the club would like to send our condolences to his family and will be here if needed by anybody."" Sergeant Lee Westhead said: ""My thoughts are with the victim's family who are being looked after by specially trained officers at this difficult time. ""Whilst we work to uncover how this has happened and piece together the moments before the collision, I am asking the public to help in any way that they can.

It comes amid renewed fears over the nuclear ambitions of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who earlier this week ordered the test of a new long-range missile said to be capable of striking the entire US mainland. Mr Rogers, who chairs the US Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defence, did not say which west coast locations were under consideration but revealed several sites were ""competing"" for the missile defence installations. :: Kim Jong Un visits factory that produced tyres for missile truck He added: ""It's just a matter of the location, and the Missile Defence Agency making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location, but also the environmental impact."" Mr Rogers (Republican) and Mr Smith (Democrat) both said the number of THAAD systems that may ultimately be deployed had yet to be determined. Missile Defence Agency deputy director Jon Hill denied the claims, saying he had ""received no tasking to site the THAAD system on the west coast"". Meanwhile, THAAD developer Lockheed Martin declined to comment on specific deployments. A spokesperson added that the defence contractor was ""ready to support the Missile Defence Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defence efforts"". THAAD is a ground-based regional system designed to shoot down ballistic missiles. The US has nine THAAD systems, two of which are deployed in South Korea and on the US territory of Guam, a Pacific island. The current locations of the other systems are not disclosed, but some THAAD missiles are known to be based at Fort Bliss, Texas. In June, the Missile Defence Agency told Congress it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptor missiles to the US Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011. A month later, the US tested THAAD systems and shot down a simulated, incoming intermediate-range ballistic missile."

Dublin has claimed the UK Government has not yet tabled a serious or credible plan to avoiding a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit, if the UK quits the EU's single market and customs union. The Irish Government has sought commitments from Theresa May on avoiding regulatory or customs divergence either side of the border after Brexit; the maintenance of the Good Friday Agreement; the retention of the Common Travel Area; and the need for continued border discussions within the second phase of Brexit negotiations. The UK Government has repeatedly insisted many of these questions cannot be answered until the next stage of withdrawal talks - on a transition period and a future EU-UK trading and customs relationship - begins.

The Met Office said it should be visible in most parts of the country, although there could be cloud in some areas. Traditionally called a Cold Moon, the supermoon will appear at its brightest at around midnight, according to Tom Kerss, an astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich. He said: ""This year's Cold Moon is closer to us than the average full moon this year; close enough to qualify as a supermoon, according to the widely accepted definition. ""The moon will reach its highest point above the horizon at midnight local time. This is when, weather permitting, it will appear at its clearest and brightest."" The full moon will be 222,761 miles from Earth, closer than its average 238,900 miles. Mr Kerss said: ""During moonrise and moonset, you might think the moon looks unusually large, but this is an illusion created in the mind when it appears close to the horizon. ""In fact, the change in the moon's apparent size throughout its orbit is imperceptible to the unaided eye."" If you want to see the Earth's natural satellite in greater detail, Mr Kerss advises using binoculars or a telescope,which he said is ""perfectly safe"". He added: ""You can see many of the moon's larger features, although at full moon its surface looks rather flat, since we don't see any shadows cast across it until its night side begins to creep into view. ""However it is possible to see the dark maria (seas) in stark contrast to the brilliant highlights of the full moon if you allow your eyes to adjust and pick out these ancient volcanic flood plains, once filled with lava.""

The victim, who didn't want to be named, said he'd only had the camera system installed a few days before. He was at work when he got an alert on his phone that there was activity at his front door and couldn't believe what had been recorded. He said: ""I was absolutely amazed, it's a busy community with dog walkers and lots of mums around with kids during the day and that someone would be so brazen to do this shocked me quite a lot."" The news comes at the busiest time of the year for online shopping with concerns that this type of theft is on the rise. According to IMRG (Interactive Media in Retail Group), December 2016 saw 143.9 million parcels delivered to online shoppers for Christmas. They predict this year that 175 million parcels will be shipped to customers. Surrey Police who are investigating the incident are urging people to ""arrange delivery for a time when you will be in, or get your parcels sent to a trusted friend or neighbour's house. Alternatively, use a company that will deliver your goods to a store or a convenient pick-up point"". Officers also say: ""If you haven't received a parcel, your first port of call should be the retailer's customer service team - you will have rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. However, if you have CCTV footage or stills of a theft in action, please report it to the police via 101 or report online."" The stolen items in this case were only worth around £10 and were Christmas gifts but the victims are concerned this could be widespread. The owner of the house said: ""The way they did it made me think this is not the first time they've done this. I think they've been doing it a lot in the area. They probably realise that nine out of 10 packages are not worth a lot but there would be other valuable ones that are high-ticket items."""

She said the ""multibillionaire rock star"" wanted to know why he had been given the annual allowance, which is worth as much as £300 for older pensioners. The Labour peer said she was of the view that the benefit should be means-tested and revealed that when she first received it, she tried to send the cash back but found there was no mechanism for doing so. ""I, like many, give that heating allowance to charity but it could be means-tested if it was added to the income tax statement of our incomes,"" she told peers. Lady Bakewell also hit out at the Chancellor, criticising Philip Hammond for failing to address the issue of social care for the elderly in last month's Budget. She told the chamber: ""The Government spends £140bn on old people. Six per cent of that goes on social care. This is bad economics and bad social care. ""Will the Government please sort it out."" Robert Plant is one of the UK's richest musicians and is believed to be worth more than £100m. He was lead singer and lyricist for Led Zeppelin, one of the most influential bands of all time, who are estimated to have sold more than 200m albums. The group had eight consecutive UK number one albums and are best known for songs including Stairway to Heaven, Rock and Roll and Whole Lotta Love."
2017-12-04,The US Supreme Court has agreed to allow the full enforcement of Donald Trump's travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171204230603/https://news.sky.com/story/us-supreme-court-backs-donald-trumps-muslim-travel-ban-11156911,"Seven of the court's nine justices granted a request from the President's administration to lift injunctions that had partially blocked the ban on travellers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It means the controversial measure to restrict travel into the US can be fully implemented, despite ongoing challenges in lower courts. The Supreme Court justices offered no explanation for the ruling, but the Trump administration had said that blocking the full ban was causing ""irreparable harm"" as the policy was based on legitimate national security and foreign policy concerns. The ban is the third version of a policy unveiled by Mr Trump in his first week in the White House. The President sparked chaos in airports across the US in January after signing an executive order to deny visas to migrants and visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The decree was suspended by a US appeals court the following month, forcing Mr Trump to issue a revised ban in March. Following a long court battle the second order expired in September and replaced with the present version, which was challenged in separate lawsuits by the state of Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union. As well as targeting six Muslim-majority countries, the ban covers people from North Korea and Venezuelan government officials. It does not exclude refugees from the US - a ban on the entry of people fleeing war and persecution expired in October. The legality of the ban is due to be argued in two US appeals courts this week, with the hearings expected to be run on an accelerated basis. This leaves open the possibility that the travel ban could return to the Supreme Court in yet another legal challenge to the White House."

Tom Kerss, an astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: ""This year's Cold Moon is closer to us than the average full moon this year; close enough to qualify as a supermoon, according to the widely accepted definition."" The moon was expected to reach its highest point above the horizon at midnight local time, he added. ""This is when, weather permitting, it will appear at its clearest and brightest."" The full moon was expected to be 222,761 miles from Earth, closer than its average 238,900 miles. Mr Kerss said: ""During moonrise and moonset, you might think the moon looks unusually large, but this is an illusion created in the mind when it appears close to the horizon. ""In fact, the change in the moon's apparent size throughout its orbit is imperceptible to the unaided eye."" If you want to see the Earth's natural satellite in greater detail, Mr Kerss advises using binoculars or a telescope, which he said is ""perfectly safe"". He added: ""You can see many of the moon's larger features, although at full moon its surface looks rather flat, since we don't see any shadows cast across it until its night side begins to creep into view. ""However it is possible to see the dark maria (seas) in stark contrast to the brilliant highlights of the full moon if you allow your eyes to adjust and pick out these ancient volcanic flood plains, once filled with lava."" The first supermoon of the year was visible on 12 January, while the second was on 3 November."

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson called the dogs' handlers into the MOD for a meeting on Monday morning, after reports appeared in various media outlets over the weekend. It is understood that he assured them everything possible would be done to find a home for the dogs. There was considerable public pressure on Mr Williamson to deliver the reprieve after a petition started by SAS soldier Andy McNab received almost 400,000 signatures. He wrote on the petition that service dogs had saved his life ""on numerous occasions"". ""We have a duty to save them,"" he said. ""In Afghanistan when I was on a patrol the dogs found an IED in front of us, I was number three in line, I was very, very lucky to survive. ""They also saved countless lives when I was in the Special Air Service sniffing out explosives."" Conservative MP and Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan also wrote to the Defence Secretary asking for answers. ""These are hero dogs who have fought fearlessly alongside our soldiers. Let us now be the ones to fight for them and give them a chance to live happy lives where they can thrive. It is the least they deserve,"" he told The Daily Telegraph. The dogs are currently being held at the Defence Animal Centre near Melton Mowbray, in Sir Alan's constituency. ""Of course, it is of great importance that all military dogs must be properly assessed to ensure they do not pose a danger to civilians, but only in circumstances where such danger has been properly proven should they be put down. I have written to MOD ministers to personally ask for a reprieve and am awaiting a response."" The dogs served multiple tours of duty in Afghanistan. Military dogs are highly trained to sniff out explosives and find safe routes for soldiers through buildings and alleyways. Once reaching a certain age they are re-trained to be safe in public. Many are considered unsafe to be rehoused and are put down; others have ailments such as arthritis relating to their years of hard military work. The founder of the German Shepherd Dog Rescue Centre told Sky News she was happy to rehouse one of the dogs - the centre's contact details were passed on to the MOD at her request. ""Once you take them away from their working environment then I think you can retrain them and carefully rehome them,"" Jayne Shenstone said. ""It's often just a one-way ticket sending them to the MOD. The MOD regard these dogs as property and when they come to the end of their working life they can just be disposed off. We regard them as serving soldiers and that they should be offered a happy retirement in the right environment for them."""

It comes amid concerns that more than a million birds and 100,000 sea mammals and turtles die each year from eating plastic waste or getting tangled in it. :: Attenborough calls for action on plastic waste to save 'future of humanity' As well as proposing extra water fountains, the London mayor wants businesses to make tap water available to the public and has written to the Government to discuss trialling a deposit return scheme. A spokesman for Mr Khan said: ""Sadiq supports boroughs in identifying suitable locations for water fountains and bottle-refill stations during the planning process in new or redeveloped public spaces, such as town centres, shopping malls, parks and squares."" The draft proposals for London do not set out the number of new water fountains that would be installed or when they would be introduced, the spokesman added. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said that water fountains were one of the solutions the Government was considering to tackle the ""surge of plastic clogging our rivers and oceans"". The Treasury launched a consultation last month that will consider how taxes or charges on single-use plastics could cut down on waste. Pret A Manger, JD Wetherspoon and Iceland are among retailers to have announced plans to curb plastic waste, while the Natural History Museum has said it will stop selling single-use plastic water bottles. :: Shocking photos emerge of 'sea plastic waste' The Scottish Government stole a march on Westminster when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon committed the SNP to the introduction of a deposit return scheme for drinks bottles. Earlier this year, Sky launched its Ocean Rescue campaign - which partly prompted the Scottish Government's action - aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the world's seas. Sky has said it will remove all single-use plastics from its operations, products and supply chain by 2020. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue and how to get involved here."

Poverty rates increased last year - 14 million people, including four million children and 1.9 million pensioners, live in poverty. The state of the nation report blamed rising housing costs, increasing food and energy bills and cuts in benefits. It also highlighted the long-term consequences of people not being able to afford pension contributions. The report says: ""Most people on low incomes have no savings and are not building up a pension. ""The decreasing proportion of the working-age population buying their own home means that in the future more older people are likely to rent and have higher housing costs in retirement."" The report describes the prospects for solving the problem as ""worrying"", adding: ""The continuing rise in employment is no longer leading to lower poverty. ""Changes to benefits and tax credits for working-age families are reducing the incomes of many of those on low incomes. ""High housing costs continue to reduce the incomes available for those in poverty to meet other needs. ""Inflation is rising and is higher for those on lower incomes than for better-off groups."" Campbell Robb, chief executive of the JRF, said: ""These worrying figures suggest that we are at a turning point in our fight against poverty. ""Political choices, wage stagnation and economic uncertainty mean that hundreds of thousands more people are now struggling to make ends meet. ""This is a very real warning sign that our hard-fought progress is in peril."" A Government spokesman said: ""We are spending an extra £4.2bn on pensioners, carers and disabled people next year, and continue to spend around £90bn a year supporting people of working age, including those who are out of work or on a low income. ""Since 2010, the number of people in absolute poverty has fallen by over half a million, pensioner poverty remains close to historically low levels and we are supporting parents with the cost of bringing up children by doubling free childcare. ""We have given the lowest earners a significant pay rise through the National Living Wage, and are introducing Universal Credit to make sure it pays to be in work."" Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ""The cuts to Universal Credit, which were not addressed in the recent Budget and mean that 'work does not always pay', will push even more children and working age adults into poverty."" The findings come just a day after Alan Milburn, the head of the the Social Mobility Commission, resigned in protest the at the Government's lack of progress towards building a ""fairer Britain""."

2017-12-04,It was all smiles at the press conference in Dublin as Ireland's Leo Varadkar got the very public backing of one of the EU's biggest hitters in his show of brinkmanship with Theresa May.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171204230603/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-irish-border-derail-progress-on-brexit-11152347,"The Taoiseach has threatened to veto what Mrs May wants - to move on to negotiating a trade deal with the European Union in just two weeks' time - unless firm assurances are given that there will be no ""hard border"". Donald Tusk, the European Council President stood alongside him, appeared to acquiesce declaring that the ""UK's future lies in some ways in Dublin"". Is this one in the eye then from our closest ally, or is this row not quite what it seems? The EU-27 must agree that ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the three key issues next week - EU citizens, money and the border - in order to move on to the next phase of negotiations, so clearly the clock is ticking. Mrs May is trapped between a rock and hard place because if Britain does leave the single market and customs union as she intends, it is hard to see how the UK's only land border with the EU - between Ulster and the Republic - can stay as it is. Indeed the Commons Brexit Committee, whose report into this issue was published on Friday morning, came to the conclusion that a return to border checks was inevitable - although it was not backed by all the MPs. :: Donald Tusk: UK's Brexit offer must be acceptable to Ireland for talks to move on The suggestion floated last week that the Government might get around this by allowing Northern Ireland the powers to have different customs regulations to the rest of the UK has triggered fury from the Democratic Unionist Party. Their 10 MPs at Westminster keep Mrs May in power, and they have made clear that any such move could see them withdraw support from her fragile administration. However unlikely it may seem that the Unionists would bring her - and their best chance of achieving Brexit - down and run the risk of propelling Jeremy Corbyn to power; senior DUP sources insist this is a real deal-breaker. For Mr Varadkar, this is also the natural moment to push Westminster hard. He also presides over a minority administration and needs to assert his authority. The UK Government has, after all, already caved in on the issue of the Brexit bill in the past week. It seems like deadlock. The DUP would veto what the party see as a border in the Irish Sea, while the Republic effectively wants Britain to stay in the customs union. The border, established in 1921, runs for 310 miles and has more than 200 public roads crossing it. The prospect of a hard border, with customs checks to enforce the tariffs which would be needed if Britain leaves the EU's customs arrangements, is not just a logistical and trade issue but would undermine the basis of the 1998 peace agreement. This issue is not going to be settled finally in the next few days, and No 10 sources say they see the border entwined with trade issues which can only be fully resolved when the talks move on to the next phase. Can Mrs May find a fudge acceptable to both sides, which would give Ireland the assurances it is seeking on the border and keep the UK Government's options open on a customs deal? Belfast is heavily reliant on trade with the rest of the UK and for Dublin, the economic consequences of a ""no deal"" Brexit could be ruinous. Behind the scenes, both the Irish government and Westminster will have to give ground. Both believe an agreement is do-able, but this fraught issue has raised the stakes uncomfortably high."

The newly promoted side looked set to make that 15 as they fell 2-1 down to AC Milan on Sunday, before goalkeeper Alberto Brignoli ventured up for a corner and leapt to power home an incredible 95th-minute equaliser. The goal sparked wild celebrations in Benevento's Stadio Ciro Vigorito and set a record as the first strike by a goalkeeper in Serie A for 16 years. Brignoli, who is on loan from Serie A champions Juventus, dedicated the goal to his Benevento teammates and management. ""I don't believe it,"" he said. ""It is so difficult to score in a situation like that. ""I'm happy for everyone, for the (club) president who never said a word out of place, for the fans who are living a dream and who certainly expected something better. ""Someone from the bench told me to go up, there was nothing to lose, I went to jump and I closed my eyes. It was an instinctive act. ""I jumped like a goalkeeper and not a striker. We have lost so many times in 90 minutes. For once, after months of sacrifice, we've done it.""

Under the plan, online platforms would be forced to carry out due diligence on customers and report suspicioustransactions in an effort to make them less attractive to criminals. The pressure was applied as Bitcoin hovered just shy of its latest record value of $11,800 (£8,790) - set on Sunday - on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. Its value has climbed by more than 1,000% in the year to date as it became increasingly seen as a financial asset similar to gold rather than a digital currency. The value fluctuated wildly last week as it approached $11,400, with seasoned investors and regulators warning of the risks of a bubble fit for bursting. However, there are hopes that the creation of futures markets next year will help soothe volatility. A particular concern for the authorities - because digital currencies are currently unregulated - is the ease of which they offer holders the ability to avoid detection. A prime example of this was seen in May when a third of NHS Trusts were crippled by hackers who demanded ransoms paid in Bitcoin to unlock their computers. The WannaCry ransomware targeted systems worldwide. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We have clear tax rules for people who use crypto-currencies and like all tax rules, these are kept under review. ""We also intend to update regulation to bring virtual currency exchange platforms into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation."""

He was attacked by the male boar after firing off a shot and moving into reeds where he came face-to-face with the mammal, witnesses said. Police said the man, who has not been identified, suffered severe injuries to his left thigh and fell into some water nearby. He was taken to hospital where he later died. Officers say they have not tracked down the boar and it is unclear whether the animal was injured. About half a million wild boar are killed each year in Germany, but experts say the numbers killed are not enough to stop the burgeoning population. In Berlin alone, about 6,000 boar live in forests on the city's outskirts. In November, four people in the northern city of Heide were injured after a male and a female boar entered a city centre bank and attacked customers. A local hunter shot the male boar but the second pig managed to escape during the commotion. Bank customers escaped from the building using ladders provided by the emergency services."
2017-12-04,The choreography of compromise is how the European Union is supposed to work.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171204230603/https://news.sky.com/story/no-deal-yet-as-the-uk-continues-to-negotiate-with-itself-11156921,"Today's plan was designed to get the main parties around the table and give them the ability to ""move together"". It did not work. It is still expected to do so, but Brexit whack-a-mole means that when you focus on solving one problem, another five pop up elsewhere. At first all seemed to be going well. Yes, there had been some over-briefing about just how easy it was going to be, but when MEPs emerged from their meeting with Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker they were struggling to contain their optimism and expectation. Even Guy Verhofstadt said a deal would probably be struck, but felt the need to say it was 50-50. But then one member of the European Parliament's Brexit steering group, Green MEP Phillipe Lamberts, decided to go live on Sky News to express his surprise at just how far the UK government had moved to assuage the fears of the Irish government. He said that Britain and the EU had agreed to a ""special situation for Ireland"" to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. ""The UK Government has come to terms with reality and that's a good thing,"" he said. Mr Lamberts told me the wording agreed to ""full alignment"" of regulatory standards with the single market and customs union, necessary to keep the border open. It sounded not dissimilar, I thought, to ""no regulatory divergence"" or like Northern Ireland staying in the customs union or single market. The MEP agreed, saying: ""Then again, that's the only solution if you want to keep the Good Friday Agreement. Period."" That and a leak in Ireland of the draft agreement was what led to the optimism that a deal would be made. But as ever, whether or not a deal was done missed the point. What always mattered was three words: ""On what terms"". When the leaked draft of these terms reached Belfast, the Democratic Unionist Party responded in force. Arlene Foster, flanked by some of the MPs who kept the PM at Number 10 following the general election in June, expressed disquiet at a deal still being discussed and debated over lunch at the Brussels Berlaymont building. ""We will not accept any sort of regulatory divergence,"" she said in front of the steps at Stormont. Technically, regulatory alignment might be something slightly different. But the Irish government and many MEPs think it is the same. The sliver of difference is that while standards are not legally compelled to remain the same, it just so happens that Northern Ireland would take back control of regulations and then choose to align them with Ireland's in order to avoid a hard border. But it was not just Northern Ireland. The European Court of Justice's role in the citizens' rights deal is a key concern of the veto-wielding European Parliament. And so it is for majority-erasing Tory Brexiteers who want to curb the court's jurisdiction. And there is something wider. The PM has given considerable ground on all three areas - the finances, rights and Northern Ireland. But she is not preparing the ground for what has always been close to an inevitable landing strip for a deal. With the EU27 already doubting her authority in a squabbling Cabinet, days like today do not help fill the well of negotiating capital. As Mrs May arrived late for her meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk, she walked straight past the arriving German finance minister Peter Altmaier - one of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's closest confidants. He told me that his government was taking a full part in negotiations amid ongoing coalition talks. ""We are in the middle of a very very complicated process,"" he said. ""(The) summit will decide, it is a very difficult issue, and there are a number of open points still on the agenda; they have to be clarified... I'm dealing with Brexit on an almost daily basis."" Back home, a statement by the PM planned for Tuesday - along with questions lasting hours - has been pulled. A form of words can be found. But the fundamental problem will just pop up elsewhere or in a few months time during phase two. The question arising today is not about the micro-tactics, it is about a fundamental issue - can avoiding Dublin's Brexit red lines to prevent a hard border be squared with the DUP's red lines? The issue was fudged under the shared sovereignty of European Union law. Can Northern Ireland be part of a United Kingdom out of the European Union and a single borderless Irish economic space inside it? Today, the PM attempted to force an answer to that question. She did not succeed."

But it said that during next year it would move to ""transform"" the business and bolster profitability by instigating a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with creditors. Its update followed an exclusive story by Sky News last week that an announcement was imminent. The toy chain, whose parent company filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in September, currently employs 3,200 in the UK and operates 84 stores. Toys R Us said it aimed to begin closing UK stores from the spring and it would look to redeploy staff to its smaller, ""more interactive"" stores though redundancies were likely. The company's UK managing director, Steve Knights, said: ""All of our stores across the UK remain open for business as normal through Christmas and well into the New Year. ""Customers can also continue to shop online and there will be no changes to our returns policies or gift cards across this period. ""Like many UK retailers in today's market environment, we need to transform our business so that we have a platform that can better meet customers' evolving needs. ""The decision to propose this CVA was a difficult one, but we (are) determined it is the best path forward to make essential changes to the business."" Toys R Us said the CVA would involve not only comprehensive operational changes but also financial restructuring. Commenting on the impact on staff, Mr Knights added: ""We recognise this process will affect many of our team members and their families, so we are committed to keeping all of our staff informed throughout this process. ""Our teams will continue to play a key role in turning our business around."" Dave Brandon, the group chairman and chief executive, said the announcement affected its UK operations only. He said: ""As we continued to work through the financial restructuring process, we made the decision to take action to put our UK operation on stronger financial footing. ""Through the CVA process, we hope to receive authorisation to restructure our UK lease obligations so that we will be better able to invest in our UK business and further improve the customer experience."

The report, written by Tory MP Rishi Sunak for right-leaning think-tank Policy Exchange, said a successful attack on Britain's network would be a ""crippling blow"" to the country's security and economy. ""Whether from terrorist activity or an increasingly bellicose Russian naval presence, the threat of these vulnerabilities being exploited is growing,"" the report said.

Charity director James Radford said: ""What we're trying to do is to encourage the very simple steps that everyone could take: find out where your closest defibrillator is, know how to spot the signs of a cardiac arrest, be ready to use CPR to resuscitate, so know that early defibrillation can make all the difference in the terms of survival."" Awareness of the problem has grown since the sudden collapse of former footballer Fabrice Muamba in 2012. His heart stopped for 78 minutes and was saved thanks to the immediate care given to him on the pitch and the use of a defibrillator 15 times. But knowledge in Britain is still behind that of other countries, Mr Radford said. ""In this country, fewer than one in 10 people survive when they have an out of hospital cardiac arrest.

2017-12-06,It was all smiles at the press conference in Dublin as Ireland's Leo Varadkar got the very public backing of one of the EU's biggest hitters in his show of brinkmanship with Theresa May.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171207002430/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-irish-border-derail-progress-on-brexit-11152347,"The Taoiseach has threatened to veto what Mrs May wants - to move on to negotiating a trade deal with the European Union in just two weeks' time - unless firm assurances are given that there will be no ""hard border"". Donald Tusk, the European Council President stood alongside him, appeared to acquiesce declaring that the ""UK's future lies in some ways in Dublin"". Is this one in the eye then from our closest ally, or is this row not quite what it seems? The EU-27 must agree that ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the three key issues next week - EU citizens, money and the border - in order to move on to the next phase of negotiations, so clearly the clock is ticking. Mrs May is trapped between a rock and hard place because if Britain does leave the single market and customs union as she intends, it is hard to see how the UK's only land border with the EU - between Ulster and the Republic - can stay as it is. Indeed the Commons Brexit Committee, whose report into this issue was published on Friday morning, came to the conclusion that a return to border checks was inevitable - although it was not backed by all the MPs. :: Donald Tusk: UK's Brexit offer must be acceptable to Ireland for talks to move on The suggestion floated last week that the Government might get around this by allowing Northern Ireland the powers to have different customs regulations to the rest of the UK has triggered fury from the Democratic Unionist Party. Their 10 MPs at Westminster keep Mrs May in power, and they have made clear that any such move could see them withdraw support from her fragile administration. However unlikely it may seem that the Unionists would bring her - and their best chance of achieving Brexit - down and run the risk of propelling Jeremy Corbyn to power; senior DUP sources insist this is a real deal-breaker. For Mr Varadkar, this is also the natural moment to push Westminster hard. He also presides over a minority administration and needs to assert his authority. The UK Government has, after all, already caved in on the issue of the Brexit bill in the past week. It seems like deadlock. The DUP would veto what the party see as a border in the Irish Sea, while the Republic effectively wants Britain to stay in the customs union. The border, established in 1921, runs for 310 miles and has more than 200 public roads crossing it. The prospect of a hard border, with customs checks to enforce the tariffs which would be needed if Britain leaves the EU's customs arrangements, is not just a logistical and trade issue but would undermine the basis of the 1998 peace agreement. This issue is not going to be settled finally in the next few days, and No 10 sources say they see the border entwined with trade issues which can only be fully resolved when the talks move on to the next phase. Can Mrs May find a fudge acceptable to both sides, which would give Ireland the assurances it is seeking on the border and keep the UK Government's options open on a customs deal? Belfast is heavily reliant on trade with the rest of the UK and for Dublin, the economic consequences of a ""no deal"" Brexit could be ruinous. Behind the scenes, both the Irish government and Westminster will have to give ground. Both believe an agreement is do-able, but this fraught issue has raised the stakes uncomfortably high."
2017-12-06,"The unresolved mystery of who was behind the Birmingham pub bombings must be addressed in the victims' inquests, their families have argued in court.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171207002430/https://news.sky.com/story/birmingham-pub-bombings-inquest-must-address-identity-of-killers-11158885,"Campaigners have started a judicial review to challenge coroner Peter Thornton QC's decision to exclude the issue of ""the perpetrators"" from the inquests into the 1974 killings. Twenty-one people died and 180 others were injured when two city centre pubs were bombed on the evening of 21 November and some of the bereaved families have said they would ""no longer participate"" in the inquests without the perpetrator issue being included. Relatives and supporters around the UK have raised £20,000, enabling them to fight the judicial review into the coroner's controversial decision. Campaigner Julie Hambleton, who was 11-years-old when she lost her 17-year-old sister Maxine in the bombings, told Sky News it was another ""seismic day"" for the families. ""It was a must"", she said. ""We had to challenge the coroner's decision because the perpetrators must be bought into scope because if they are not bought into scope there is no point having an inquest - it will be null and void."" In written submissions, the coroner explained it was not mandatory for him to consider who was behind the bomb. The coroner also pointed out enormous amounts of material would be required and that the assessment of perpetrators would be measured in years not months. ""Thus the many years of expensive and exhaustive endeavour would not result in the claimants' principal goal: a public conclusion about who bombed Birmingham. ""That aim is entirely legitimate and understandable. But it is not one that these inquests can achieve."" The 10 families represented in the court action argue that the coroner failed to fully consider whether he had a duty to consider the identities of the people responsible. In 1975, a group of Irishmen known as the ""Birmingham Six"" were jailed over the bombing but the convictions were quashed on appeal in 1991. Outside court in London after their release, one of the men, Paddy Hill, said: ""The police told us from the start they knew we hadn't done it. They didn't care who had done it."" In July this year, a self-confessed former IRA member Michael Hayes admitted he was the man who helped build the bombs, but refused to say who had planted them. The families believe the current inquests represent the ""first and last time"" that a fully independent investigation can realistically take place and finally establish the truth. Last month, on the 43rd anniversary of the bombings, the victims were posthumously awarded Freedom of the City of Birmingham. The new inquests are on hold pending the result of the judicial review, which is expected to conclude on Thursday."

The LA archdiocese sued the sisters, who said only they had the right to sell it, despite not living there since 2011, and won. They also said Ms Hollister's actions prevented the sale to Ms Perry, who had offered $14.5m. A jury agreed with Ms Perry and the Catholic Church that Ms Hollister had acted with malice, and awarded $10m to the parties, which will be split with one-third going to the singer and two-thirds to the church. In a statement from the archdiocese, to the Angulus website, the church explained it took action because Ms Hollister had paid $44,000 for the property, and they felt the sisters had been taken advantage of. The archdiocese statement adds: ""Hollister's actions left the IHM Sisters with almost nothing for their property, while she took possession of their former convent to prevent the sale of the property to singer Katy Perry who had presented a cash offer for $14.5m for the Waverly property and a replacement for the House of Prayer of Priests. ""The proceeds from any sale of the property will be for the IHM Institute to be used for the care and well-being of all five remaining Sisters. ""Hollister knowingly took advantage of two of the elderly sisters which jeopardised the future health and well-being of all IHM Sisters. ""The archdiocese and counsel for Ms Perry were in court seeking a just resolution in the best interest of all the five remaining IHM Sisters and to hold Hollister accountable for damages and legal fees."" Ms Hollister's offer did not guarantee the sisters would ever receive more money. One of the sisters, Rita Callanan, told the LA Times that she had sought a different buyer for the convent when she had seen Ms Perry's music videos. She said: ""Well, I found Katy Perry and I found her videos and ... if it's all right to say, I wasn't happy with any of it."" Eric Rowen of Greenberg Traurig LLP told Billboard this week: ""Katy is extremely pleased with the jury's insight and understanding, and is hopeful that the jury's decision will pave the way for her to complete the purchase of the Waverly property without further interference.

It blamed more challenging trading in insurance broking and a £2m one-off hit to its tour business from the collapse of Monarch Airlines in October. In addition, the company said it expected the same profit measure in 2018 to be 5% down on this year because of the current headwinds and its decision to invest £10m on ""customer acquisition"" - marketing, in other words. Saga said a review of its operating structure would result in about £10m of annualised savings next year. It had previously announced 100 redundancies. Chief executive, Lance Batchelor, said: ""Against a backdrop of some challenging trading conditions in our final quarter, we continue to develop the business for the long term. ""With greater customer insight and a stronger business platform, now is the right time for Saga to invest in growing the customer base and the business.

Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said of the profit warning: ""The collapse of Monarch Airlines and industry wide headwinds in home insurance are outside Saga's control. ""But lower reserve releases and a rapid decline in benefits from the introduction of the motor broker panel shouldn't be coming as a surprise to management. ""The fact that the group feels the need to throw more cash at customer acquisition is also less than reassuring. ""Saga's pitch was always that its huge mailing list means all the clients it could ever want are just a mail drop away, the extra spending suggests it might not be as clean cut as that.""

2017-12-06,"As deals in the UK's commercial property sector go, they don't come much bigger than this.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171207002430/https://news.sky.com/story/the-34bn-deal-to-secure-shopping-centre-dominance-11158649,"Britain's two biggest shopping centre operators have announcerd plans to join forces in a deal that could transform the retail landscape. Hammerson, the owner of shopping centres including the Bullring in Birmingham, Brent Cross in north London and Cabot Circus in Bristol, is buying rival Intu, whose sites include the famous Lakeside centre in Thurrock, Essex, as well as the Trafford Centre and Arndale in Manchester, Braehead in Glasgow and the famous Metro Centre in Gateshead. The £3.4bn all-share deal will make Hammerson the UK's biggest property company as the two businesses, on Tuesday night's closing share prices, had a combined stock market value of £7.3bn. The deal also says much about the changing nature of shopping in this country. Traditional shopping, in 'bricks and mortar' stores, is under siege like never before by online. The assault, exacerbated by crushing business rates and the imposition of the National Living Wage, has seen many British high streets wither as a result - with many stalwart retailers shutting up shop and leaving the field to charity shops, estate agents, bookmakers and coffee shops. The argument of shopping centre operators like Hammerson and Intu has been that, as high streets lose their attractiveness to retailers, well-presented shopping centres in prime locations, offering an all-round experience for consumers including dining and entertainment, would continue to thrive. That has generally proved to be the case. The big battalions of UK retail - the likes of John Lewis, Next and Marks & Spencer - have been willing to position themselves as 'anchor tenants' in prime shopping centres. Sites like some of those mentioned above have continued to do well. But shopping centres in secondary locations have not done as well and have found themselves being offloaded by the major property players. Yet City investors have been unconvinced by the story. Shares in the likes of Hammerson and Intu have been trading at a significant discount to their 'net asset value' - crudely put, the sum shareholders would receive if a company was to wind itself up, sell all its assets and return the proceeds - for quite some time because investors have convinced themselves that traditional retailing is a dead duck and that the future lies online. Prior to today's news, shares of Intu had fallen by just under 30% since the beginning of the year, despite the company continuing to increase its rental income and enjoying an occupancy rate of more than 95% in its UK sites. Before news of today's deal, its shares stood at just 199p each, compared with a net asset value of 404p at the half-year stage. Allied to this turnaround in sentiment has been the way the City has fallen over itself to invest in property firms that are perceived as having exposure to online shopping. So Segro, whose assets mainly consist of warehouses in Greater London, the Thames Valley and the Midlands, has seen its share price rise by just under 20% so far this year. Those warehouses store goods being shipped around the country in online retail transactions and, accordingly, it is seen as a beneficiary of changing shopping habits. Symbolically, when Intu dropped out of the FTSE-100 in May this year, its place was taken by Segro. Adding to the depression in sentiment has been concerns of a post-Brexit downturn in consumer spending. So this takeover of Intu - a takeover made possible by the weakness in Intu's share price - is a response to the concerns of investors as well as a chance for Hammerson to bulk up. The question is whether the Competition & Markets Authority will choose to intervene. The combined business will dominate the shopping centre market in certain parts of the country, notably the West Midlands, where the Bullring competes with Intu's Merry Hill centre just up the road in Dudley. It may well insist on some disposals being made. Retailers will be anxious at the formation of such a major player dominating the shopping centre sector. This is also far from a 'pure play' British retail operator. Hammerson has assets in France and Ireland while Intu owns shopping centres in Spain. Some investors, though, may welcome that as a hedge against Brexit. This is a big, bold deal and a big, bold response to the depression in shareholder sentiment towards shopping centres and traditional retailing. How retailers themselves respond will be fascinating to watch."

2017-12-06,"A fragment of bone said to belong to the man who inspired the figure of Father Christmas could really be from the saint, scientists say.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171207002430/https://news.sky.com/story/fourth-century-bone-fragment-could-be-from-saint-who-inspired-father-christmas-11158452,"The relic, a piece of pelvis bone, is owned by Father Dennis O'Neill, from Illinois, and has been tested by researchers at the University of Oxford to establish its age. Rather than finding it's significantly younger than early estimations, the radiocarbon testing dates the piece to the fourth century AD, close to when Saint Nicholas died in 343 AD. The team at the university cannot prove for certain it is the saint, but they can pinpoint the era it is from. Professor Tom Higham, director of the Oxford Relics Cluster at Keble College's Advanced Studies Centre, said: ""Many relics that we study turn out to date to a period somewhat later than the historic attestation would suggest. ""This bone fragment, in contrast, suggests that we could possibly be looking at remains from St Nicholas himself. ""Science is not able to definitely prove that it is, it can only prove that it is not, however."" St Nicholas is one of the most revered Christian saints, and is thought to have lived in Myra, which is now Turkey. He was said to be a wealthy man who was known for his generosity, which inspired the story of Father Christmas bringing presents to children on Christmas Eve. Most of his remains are in the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari, Italy, and though they have been there since 1087, several churches around the world have acquired some of the fragments. Dr Georges Kazan, another director at the Oxford Relics Cluster, said the results would encourage them to test other relics from Bari and Venice, to show if they are the same person. He added: ""It is exciting to think that these relics, which date from such an ancient time, could in fact be genuine."""
2017-12-06,"A group of Tory MPs has written to Theresa May expressing outrage at colleagues ""imposing their own conditions"" on the Brexit negotiations.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171207002430/https://news.sky.com/story/tory-mps-criticise-highly-irresponsible-arch-brexiteer-colleagues-11159382,"The 19 backbenchers blasted ""highly irresponsible"" interventions urging the UK to walk away from talks with Brussels. They have accused hardline Brexiteers of ""deliberately"" making trading arrangements in the event of a 'no deal' divorce ""sound as if this is some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt"". Quitting the bloc with a deal, they say, is ""essential"". Wednesday's intervention comes at a high-stakes point in the Brexit talks, as Prime Minister Theresa May races to placate the DUP and Ireland to move talks on to trade. She faced pressure from Brexiteer backbenchers not to breach her ""red lines"" - and even to ""apply a new coat of paint"" to them - at this week's Prime Minister's Questions. The signatories to the new letter include a mix of historically outspoken MPs as well as those who have previously resisted directly criticising their own benches. They include former education secretary Nicky Morgan, newly elected Scottish MP Paul Masterton and Commons defence committee member Johnny Mercer. Writing about those calling for a 'no deal' Brexit, the group said: ""They miss the many business and other voices who have made it clear that… (it) would lead to great uncertainty for EU citizens living here and UK citizens living in the EU, higher costs and reduced choice for consumers, disruption at our ports and borders and grave questions about how cross-border contracts are to be fulfilled."" Mrs May maintains that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" but hopes the issues of the Irish border, EU citizens and the exit bill can be resolved to commence the second stage of negotiations."

In an apparently coordinated effort, prominent Leave-supporting MPs warned the Government against closely aligning the UK with Brussels after Brexit. Jacob Rees-Mogg urged Mrs May to ""apply a new coat of paint to her red lines"" amid his ""fear"" they had begun ""to look a little bit pink"" this week. His demand came after the Prime Minister's hopes of achieving a draft agreement on the first phase of Brexit negotiations were sunk by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), mid-way through her trip to Brussels on Monday. The Northern Ireland party, who prop up Mrs May's Government at Westminster, failed to give their consent to a draft text on the Irish border. They fear being left aligned to EU regulation while the rest of the UK diverges from Brussels rules after 2019, effectively separating Northern Ireland from Scotland, England and Wales. The Government have since tried to reassure the DUP any post-Brexit alignment with EU rules would be conducted on a UK-wide basis, which has raised fears among those Tory MPs wanting a clean break from the bloc. In response to Mr Rees-Mogg, the Prime Minister insisted ""the principles on which the Government are negotiating were set out in the Lancaster House speech and in the Florence speech, and those principles remain"". Mrs May was also forced to declare the Government is ""on course to deliver what the people of this country voted for when they voted to leave the EU"" when quizzed by Mr Rees-Mogg's fellow Brexiteer Peter Bone. Offering to help ""sort"" the Brexit negotiations by travelling to Brussels with the Prime Minister, Mr Bone asked: ""When the British people voted to leave the European super-state, they voted to end the free movement of people, to stop sending billions and billions of pounds to the EU each and every year, and to make our laws in our own country, judged by our own judges. ""Are we still on course to deliver that?"" Bernard Jenkin was a third Tory Brexiteer to tackle Mrs May during the session, as he urged the Prime Minister not to leave Britain ""shackled"" to Brussels after Brexit, in order for the UK to have the ability to sign free trade deals with non-EU countries. Mrs May replied: ""We want to ensure that we get a good trade deal with the EU and the freedom to negotiate these trade deals around the rest of the world."" Later on Wednesday, Chancellor Philip Hammond admitted the Cabinet has not yet decided what post-Brexit relationship it will seek with the EU in the second phase of divorce talks with Brussels, when both sides will discuss a future trade relationship. It has been suggested Remain supporters such as Mr Hammond favour closer ties with the EU, in contrast to his Cabinet colleagues and Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove."

The 20-year-old, of Ballards Lane, in Finchley, north London, is also charged with helping another man, Mohammed Aqib Imran, prepare terror. Imran, 21, of Ombersley Road, in the Sparkbrook area of Birmingham, also appeared in court charged with trying to join Islamic State and preparing acts of terror. He too was remanded in custody. The pair, who were arrested in armed police raids in London and Birmingham last week, will appear at the Old Bailey on 20 December. MI5 head Andrew Parker briefed Cabinet ministers with details of the alleged plot to assassinate the Prime Minister on Tuesday. It came as the security agency revealed it had prevented nine terror attacks in the UK in the past year. Downing Street is protected by armed police officers and separated from the public by fortified gates. Security measures were introduced in the 1970s but were increased in the 1980s as the threat from Irish republican groups grew. In 1991, the IRA launched a homemade mortar bomb attack on Number 10 and the device landed in the back garden. The then prime minister, John Major, was inside but was not hurt."

Hundreds of buildings have already been destroyed. Hilton wrote on Twitter: ""This wildfire in LA is terrifying! My house is now being evacuated to get all of my pets out of there safely. ""Thank you to all the firefighters who are risking their lives to save ours. You are true heroes!"" Singer Lana Del Rey tweeted that ""ash is falling on my car"", while comedian Handler wrote: ""It's like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire. Literally and figuratively. Stay safe everyone. Dark times."" Firefighters are warning they cannot contain the spread of fires in the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Bel Air, an area popular with celebrities. Teams made up of more than 1,000 firefighters are attempting, seemingly in vain, to contain the fires igniting across the region. The flames are sweeping down the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains. Police were forced to shut down nine miles of the Interstate 405 freeway, one of the busiest in the US, early on Wednesday morning. Motorists described seeing the mountainside near Bel Air glowing and an orange fireball burning its way through the drought-ridden terrain. The blaze has been dubbed the Skirball fire as it is right next to the Skirball Cultural Center, as well as the acclaimed Getty Center museum. One of the fires has reached an estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and stars including Gwyneth Paltrow, Kim Kardashian and Cher have been offering their prayers and thanks to firefighters. Model Teigen said: ""Never though I'd get to actually play what I thought was a hypothetical game of 'what would you grab?' if there were a fire. ""So far all I have is (daughter) Luna, some limited edition Oreos and my Spike TV award."" Several other fires are raging across southern California, with the Skirball the latest to ignite due to 50mph wind gusts - which are set to increase to 70mph on Thursday. The strong winds have prevented planes and helicopters operating as it is too dangerous to fly. Mark Lorenzen, Ventura County fire chief, said: ""The prospects for containment are not good. ""Really, Mother Nature's going to decide when we have the ability to put it out."" Hundreds of homes have been destroyed and a further 12,000 buildings and structures are threatened by Thomas alone, officials said. California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in the area on Tuesday. He said: ""This fire is very dangerous and spreading rapidly. ""It's critical residents stay ready and evacuate immediately if told to do so."" US President Donald Trump tweeted his ""thoughts and prayers"" to California. He said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of California's wildfires. ""I encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials. ""THANK YOU to all First Responders for your incredible work!"""

However, he claimed an 850-page document given to MPs last week provided a ""sectoral analysis"", giving information on different parts of the economy. Mr Davis made the comments during a grilling from the Brexit select committee, and also admitted he had only read two chapters of the paper. Asked if there were studies into Brexit's impact on industries including aerospace and financial services, the minister said: ""I think the answer is going to be no to all of them."" He explained: ""You don't need to do a formal impact assessment to understand that if there is a regulatory hurdle between our producers and a market that they will have an impact - an effect. ""The assessment of that effect is not as straightforward as people imagine. ""I am not a fan of economic models because they have all proven wrong."" Mr Davis added: ""We will at some stage do the best we can to quantify the effect of different negotiating outcomes as we come up with them."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn seized on the comments, branding the row ""a shambles"". Mr Davis has previously responded to questions about Brexit impact assessments by saying they are ""in excruciating deal"". And he said in February: ""We continue to analyse the impact of our exit across the breadth of the UK economy, covering more than 50 sectors."" The Brexit Secretary is facing allegations of contempt of Parliament over his department's response to a vote on releasing the impact assessments. A Labour motion calling for them to be shared with Brexit select committee chair Hilary Benn was passed unopposed in November. But Mr Benn said the documents received were ""not in keeping"" with the binding motion. Sky News understands his committee will reconvene this afternoon to discuss contempt proceedings being brought against Mr Davis. Contempt of Parliament - when an MP obstructs the House of Commons carrying out its job - can result in those ruled against being suspended or expelled."

He told Sky News: ""Massive thank you to everyone who supported me and the five others. ""It feels excellent to be home."" He was one of six guards arrested for smuggling weapons but they have now received permission to leave India. The others, including Nick Dunn, John Armstrong, Nicholas Simpson, Ray Tindall and Paul Towers, are expected back on Thursday. Mr Irving was greeted by family who made ""Welcome Home, Billy"" signs, and by two pipers who played as the 37-year-old walked out of the airport. A cut and shave meant he looked quite different to the last photos of him while still in India. In a statement given after the ruling, the six said: ""After four long years, we, along with the 29 crew of the Seaman Guard Ohio, have been cleared by the Appeal Court. We want to thank the court for reaching this decision. ""We are all in good health and eager to return to our families and friends. Whilst we wait for permission to leave India and come home, we ask the media to respect our privacy and that of our families during this process. ""We want to thank our legal counsel, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Mission to Seafarers for helping us reach this point. ""We have been glad to receive the many messages of support and care packages during our time in prison, and ask for time to reflect on our experience and to prepare for home."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""It is wonderful news that the men are returning to the UK. ""The Foreign Office has worked unstintingly on this case, lobbying on the men's behalf, visiting them in prison, updating their families, and maintaining close contact with their legal team. ""I pay tribute to those who have campaigned for the men, who will be delighted to see them return home after being separated for so long."" The six men were arrested in October 2013 when the Indian Coastguard boarded their ship, the MV Sean Guard Ohio. They were arrested for taking weapons into India's waters, but the charges were quashed when the men showed their UK paperwork and argued they were carrying them for anti-piracy purposes. A lower court reinstated the charges and they were sentenced to five years in jail in January last year. They have launched a series of appeals, finally getting success at the end of November."
2017-12-06,"After a terror plot to assassinate Theresa May was foiled, which other prime ministers have been targeted?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171207002430/https://news.sky.com/story/the-plots-to-kill-prime-ministers-11159098,":: Spencer Perceval is the only British prime minister to have been assassinated. He was shot at around 5.15pm on 11 May 1812 in the lobby of the House of Commons. His killer was John Bellingham, a failed businessman who was angry at the government's response to his previous imprisonment in Russia. He hid a pistol in a secret pocket of his coat and, after shooting Perceval in the heart, calmly gave himself up. Bellingham was hanged in public later the same month following a trial. :: Herbert Asquith was feared to be the target of militant suffragettes after two women were spotted practising at a shooting range in September 1909. An informant warned Scotland Yard the plotters were among those known to picket the House of Commons, although they were never traced. The government was unwilling to publicise the threat against the prime minister, with the plot only emerging in 2006 within files released by the National Archives. :: David Lloyd George was subject to a number of assassination plots during his spell as prime minister. In 1917, suffragette Alice Wheeldon, her daughter Winnie, and son-in-law Alfred were imprisoned for attempting to poison Lloyd George. However, in recent years, their ancestors have begun a campaign to clear their names, claiming the family were set-up by undercover government agents. In 1923, Lloyd George was believed to have been targeted by a group of ""fanatical Turks"", who plotted to kill the British prime minister at a conference in Germany. A secret police report revealing the claims was released in 2000. :: Winston Churchill, as Britain's war-time leader, was naturally a target for the Nazis during the Second World War. The most eye-catching plot was a plan to kill the prime minister with a bar of exploding chocolate. The 1943 scheme, in which bombmakers were to coat explosive devices with a thin layer of dark chocolate, was uncovered in historic papers nearly 70 years later. Also that year, the Nazis planned to simultaneously kill Russian leader Joseph Stalin, US President Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill during the Allies leaders conference in Tehran. Dubbed Operation Long Jump, the plot was to be led by Adolf Hitler's SS but was foiled by Russian spies. :: Alec Douglas-Home didn't face a threat to his life during his 12 months as prime minister, but was subject to an attempted kidnapping by a group of left-wing students. While staying at a country house in Scotland, the Tory leader was confronted by the students at the door, who informed him they were going to take him away. But, playing for time, Douglas-Home asked to pack a few things and then invited the group into the house. After being given beer, the students abandoned their kidnap plot. :: Margaret Thatcher narrowly escaped injury when a bomb tore apart the Brighton Grand Hotel where members of the government were staying during the 1984 Conservative Party conference. Five people, including Tory MP Sir Anthony Berry, were killed and 31 injured in the IRA bombing in the early hours of the morning. Thatcher began the next session of the conference the following day, as scheduled. Bomber Patrick Magee was given eight life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1986. He was released in 1999 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. :: John Major was chairing a meeting of his cabinet in 1991 when three IRA mortar rounds were fired from an abandoned van towards Downing Street, with one exploding in Number 10's garden. However, the blast did not shatter the bomb-proof glass of the Cabinet Room's windows and there was no structural damage to the building despite a scorching. Mr Major later told the House of Commons it was a ""deliberate attempt"" to kill his top ministers, who had continued their meeting in an adjoining building. :: David Cameron was forced to cancel a 2010 visit to meet British troops in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, amid fears the Taliban were plotting an attack. Mobile phone calls referring to a possible rocket attack on a helicopter were intercepted by the British military, prompting a diversion for the aircraft carrying the prime minister. The Taliban later boasted of knowing details of Mr Cameron's trip to the country and insisted he was ""lucky"" to escape unhurt."

He made the comments to the Treasury select committee on Wednesday afternoon, also saying the higher rate inclusion was ""something we should be extremely proud of"". Mr Hammond said productivity was not the only indicator of economic health, adding: ""It may have collateral impact on measured productivity performance."" But the comments sparked fury among Labour MPs. Marsha de Cordova, shadow minister for disabled people, who is registered blind, called the comments ""disgusting scapegoating"". She wrote on Twitter: ""Shocking that Philip Hammond is trying to blame disabled people for low productivity! ""Disabled people contribute enormously and disability employment gap has barely changed since productivity started to stall. Disgusting scapegoating!"" Debbie Abrahams, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, also called for the Chancellor to apologise, saying in a statement: ""We should be increasing disabled people's access to employment, not denigrating their contributions. The Chancellor should apologise immediately."" Treasury committee member John Mann said on Twitter: ""Appalling. Chancellor just linked low productivity growth to the labour market and specified the increased employment of disabled people. ""My experience of employing disabled people is that they are brilliant employees. The Chancellor's comments are ignorant."" Around 300,000 more people with disabilities are in work now than in January 2014, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The Government has been aiming to drive more people into work through changes to the benefits system, and announced in last month's Budget a plan to get a million more into employment. It comes after the Chancellor's gaffe last month, when he insisted there are ""no unemployed people""."

More than half of those surveyed said they had seen their friends circulating nude or nearly nude pictures of someone they knew, without consent - dubbed 'revenge porn'. A third of the 1,559 13-to-17-year-olds who answered said they had seen someone set up a bait out page. Researchers also found cases of teenagers impersonating one another on social media, using photos on a fake profile to target them, or creating groups or conversations about them and excluding the victim. The report notes: ""The 'bait out' phenomenon characterises this, with young people setting up a page or group on social media for people in their school or local area to share sexual gossip or images. ""This 'shaming' culture is particularly targeted at girls, who can face ongoing harassment and bullying as a result."" Girls are more likely to experience problems associated with sexual harassment, according to the report. A quarter of those who responded said they had seen someone take a sexual photo of someone else without consent, known as ""creep shots"" or ""upskirting"", and 8% admitted doing it themselves in the last year. The majority of teenagers said they would turn to friends rather than teachers or parents to deal with the bullying, with 80% saying they would block the perpetrator. In one composite case study, the report tells the story of a 13-year-old called Sara, who send nudes to an older boy in the hope he would go out with her. She is then told her pictures have been posted onto a page called 'Slags_of_Birmingham_xx', but she cannot access the page to check without first sending in her own gossip. Will Gardner, CEO of Childnet, said: ""Digital technology plays a central role in young people's lives but it has opened the door for a range of new forms of sexual harassment, making societal discussions about these issues more pertinent than ever. It is evidently something that as a society we can no longer ignore. ""Throughout the development of this report we have listened to the stories of young people who are navigating the complexities of relationships in a digital age and in some cases are facing the worst forms of peer-to-peer victimisation and online sexual harassment."" Instagram has been contacted by Sky News for comment."

""There will also be frequent showers across the north and west of the UK and Ireland through the day, which will turn increasingly to sleet and snow, mainly over high ground. ""The wintry showers combined with the strong gusty winds will likely cause poor visibility on the roads and therefore disruption to travel."" Almost half of the workers on a North Sea platform have been relocated amid safety fears over conditions on Thursday. CNR International said 69 of the 159 staff on Ninian South, about 240 miles from Aberdeen, would be leaving the structure as a precaution. Later this week, snow and falling temperatures are forecast for parts of Britain. Snow showers will affect northern Scotland later on Thursday, while a yellow snow and ice warning is in place for Scotland, Northern Ireland, western England and Wales on Friday."

He was reported to police by his co-workers after detectives issued a public appeal with pictures of the 31-year-old slotting the camera into the grate. After his arrest, Dines admitted installing a similar device in the toilets of his employer's offices in New Malden, southwest London. Further mini cameras and memory cards were found at his home address, as well as a screwdriver. Dines pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism relating to the Starbucks camera and two similar charges relating to the camera at his place of work. He was sentenced to 200 hours of unpaid work, ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for five years and banned from living in a house with children under the age of 18 during that period. Dines must also pay £170 in court costs and victim surcharges and complete a 30-day rehabilitation requirement.

He also confirmed that planning would begin to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Speaking from the White House, Mr Trump overturned decades of US policy, declaring: ""Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital. ""Acknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace."" Middle East neighbours and countries around the world say it will increase tensions in the region and harm the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Iran warned it would ""provoke Muslims"" and lead to an ""increase in radical, angry and violent behaviour"". Mr Trump stressed that his declaration was not a judgement on the final status of the disputed city or any borders. ""[It] is not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace,"" he said. Vice President Mike Pence will travel to the region in the coming days, with protests expected to intensify and US government employees and citizens abroad warned to exercise caution. Islamist group Hamas said the decision ""opened the gates of hell"" on US interests in the Middle East. Jerusalem is a flashpoint because it is home to sites which are holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians. :: Analysis: Why does Donald Trump want to move the US embassy in Israel? Most countries agree its status can only be settled by inclusive negotiations and do not recognise Israel's claim to the entire city. Israel insists it has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years and the country's capital for 70 years. Its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, praised a ""courageous and just decision"" and said it was a ""historic day"", as he urged other countries to follow America's lead. David Keyes, Mr Netanyahu's spokesman, told Sky News it ""moves peace forward in a very clear and simple way"". He said it corrected ""a historical anomaly, a great historical mistake that denied Israel the same right that every other country around the world has, which is to define where its capital is"". This is a historic day. Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years. Jerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia. Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years. Thank you, @realDonaldTrump! 🇮🇱🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/mWCUpUMpiC Palestinians however want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state - Israel captured and annexed the area in 1967. President Mahmoud Abbas reacted to the US move by calling Jerusalem the ""eternal capital of the state of Palestine"". World powers have also been quick to condemn Mr Trump's move. British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement: ""We disagree with the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem and recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital before a final status agreement... ""Our position on the status of Jerusalem is clear and long-standing: it should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states."" France's president Emmanuel Macron told reporters: ""This decision is a regrettable decision that France does not approve of and goes against international law and all the resolutions of the UN Security Council."" Iran's foreign ministry said the ""provocative and unwise decision"" would ""provoke Muslims and inflame a new intifada and an escalation of radical, angry and violent behaviour"". Turkey called it ""irresponsible"" while Egypt's foreign ministry also rejected the US President's declaration. UN chief Antonio Gutteres said he was ""against any unilateral measures that would jeopardise the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians"" and that there was ""no plan B"" to a two-state solution. Mr Abbas said the US decision was a ""declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process"". He said Palestinian leaders would meet in the coming days and consult with Arab leaders on their response."

Just hours earlier, Steinhoff had confirmed it was unable to release its latest financial results as planned that morning because it had asked auditors from PwC to examine its accounting practices. It added that Markus Jooste - its CEO of almost 20 years - had resigned with immediate effect. Its statement said: ""The Supervisory Board of Steinhoff wishes to advise shareholders that new information has come to light today which relates to accounting irregularities requiring further investigation. ""Steinhoff will update the market as the aforesaid investigation proceeds."" The company stressed that it still had profitable businesses in its portfolio and urged investors to ""exercise caution"" when trading its shares in the wake of the disclosures. Steinhoff's African businesses include a range of credit-based household goods retailers and the company also has extensive interests in Europe, including German chain Poco and France's Conforama. Its European operation expanded last year to include UK discount retailer Poundland. It already owned Bensons for Beds and Harveys at that time. While the nature of its accounting investigation was not disclosed, it had already been known that it was facing a tax probe in Germany. The company had previously said authorities there were examining whether revenue was booked correctly and taxable profit correctly declared. Steinhoff said its chairman and largest shareholder Christo Wiese would take temporary charge while a successor to Mr Jooste was identified. It added that Mr Wiese would ""embark on a detailed review of all aspects of the company's business with a view to maximising shareholder value"" but gave no further information on what that would entail."

He added: ""James was a hugely respected officer, serving with the force for 18 years in a variety of roles including in local policing, roads policing and force intelligence and specialist operations.

David Cameron was the first British prime minister to visit a memorial for the Amritsar massacre in the northern state of Punjab in February 2013. He described the massacre by troops under British command as ""deeply shameful"", but stopped short of an apology. Writing in the memorial's visitors' book on Wednesday, Mr Khan said it had been ""incredibly moving"" to see the site of the mass shooting, calling it a tragedy that should never be forgotten. ""It is time for the British government to finally apologise,"" wrote Mr Khan. ""Our thoughts are with all those who died."" He also laid a wreath at the site and said afterwards: ""It is wrong that successive British governments have fallen short of delivering a formal apology to the families of those who were killed.

2017-12-06,​​​​​​​Why does Donald Trump want to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171207002430/https://news.sky.com/story/why-does-donald-trump-want-to-move-the-us-embassy-in-israel-11157826,"Trump has long championed the causes of those on the hard-right of Israeli politics. Not least because they have supported him. Take Las Vegas casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson - a passionate supporter of radical Jewish settler groups in Jerusalem. He gave a cool $35 million to groups supporting Trump's election campaign, which bought him a seat on the platform among former presidents for Trump's inauguration. He has been said to be furious at Trump's delays in moving the embassy :: Trump confirms Jerusalem embassy plan Why isn't the embassy already in Jerusalem? Jerusalem's status has not been settled because negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians have never reached a final agreement. Both sides claim it as their capital, so if America puts its Israeli embassy in Jerusalem it would be recognising it as Israel's capital. That would be seen as taking sides and that could fatally undermine its role as an honest, neutral broker. How can both sides claim the same city as their capital? Israelis calls Jerusalem their 'eternal undivided' capital. It is the centre of the Jewish religion, where the Bible's King David built his city and where their temples stood on 'Temple Mount'. Muslims call the same mount, the Harem esh Sharif, and revere it as their 3rd holiest site, believing it's where the prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. For Israelis their capital can't be anywhere else, but for Palestinians to give up a claim to a site seen as sacred by hundreds of millions of Muslims is equally unthinkable. So do Israelis want Trump to move the embassy?  Not necessarily. Some on the right of Israeli politics do, but many others do not. They say it would be premature without a final peace agreement with the Palestinians and fear the consequences. Former Israeli ambassadors, for instance, have just warned moving it could finish what is left of hopes for peace in the region. What do Palestinians say? Islamist group Hamas says it would ignite a third Palestinian uprising or intifada. The more moderate leadership on the West Bank says it would destroy America's role as peace broker and scupper any chances of peace. From Turkey to Malaysia, Muslims have echoed those sentiments. Are US allies supportive? Donald Trump has been warned by allies in varying degrees of severity not to go ahead with the move. The possibility is causing deep concern in foreign ministries around the world. What happens next? The world holds its breath, knowing this may be the closest we have come to the US embassy being moved and the geopolitical earthquake it would unleash. The President is weak, falling in the polls, beleaguered by an ever tightening investigation and in need of a distraction. But moving the embassy would be playing into the hands of Islamist extremists. If America deserts its neutral role in the Middle East conflict, the move would provide a huge boost for their efforts to enlist new recruits. That would put in danger the lives of Americans and their allies. Most of the rest of the world does not want the move because Israel's final status has not been settled in negotiations with Palestinians. Why not? Israel had the western part of the city before the war of 1967 and in that war took the rest including the historic old city which is among the most politically radioactive real estate on Earth. It has held onto those territorial gains ever since. Why so radioactive? For Jews Jerusalem is sacred ground. It is the centre of its religion and where Solomon built the first Jewish temple. On that very spot, Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven before returning again to Earth, The Dome of the Rock that marks that spot is Islam's third most holy place, after Mecca and Medina."

A hole in the snow on the top of the mountain has been becoming 45cm deeper every day. It is now more than 22 metres (72ft) lower than where it was before the activity began. There has also been a recent increase in seismic activity and geothermal water leakage, volcanologists have said. Experts at Iceland's Meteorological Office have detected 160 earthquakes in the region in the past week alone. As a result, authorities have raised the volcano's alert safety code to yellow. The University of Iceland's Ingibjorg Jonsdottir told the Morgunbladid newspaper: ""We see a greatly increased pattern of fissures around the caldera. It's now more of a drop shape than a circle, lengthening towards the southwest."" Volcanologist Armann Hoskuldsson added: ""The geothermal energy is still present and it shows that it is far from a normal process there."" The caldera is about 100 miles (160km) from the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, but there are settlements within just a few miles. When Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull erupted in 2010, the resulting ash plume brought widespread disruption to flights across Europe and the Atlantic. Fears that the tiny particles of volcanic material spewed into the atmosphere would damage aircraft left millions of people stranded. An evacuation plan has been put in place as Oraefajokull neighbours the main east-west route across the island. The volcano has erupted twice in recorded history, in 1362 and 1727-28. According to the Summitpost website, the 1362 eruption resulted in the greatest amount of rock, ash and other material being ejected out of any Icelandic volcano in history and in the area nearby being abandoned for decades."

Rowling, who pens the spin-off film series, said stories surrounding Depp ""deeply concerned"" her when they emerged at the time when he was filming the first movie. She said she and director David Yates had considered recasting for the role for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. But in a statement the author said while she understood some fans will not be pleased, she is ""genuinely happy"" for Depp to play the leading character. ""When Johnny Depp was cast as Grindelwald, I thought he'd be wonderful in the role,"" she said. ""However, around the time of filming his cameo in the first movie, stories had appeared in the press that deeply concerned me and everyone most closely involved in the franchise. ""Harry Potter fans had legitimate questions and concerns about our choice to continue with Johnny Depp in the role. As David Yates, long-time Potter director, has already said, we naturally considered the possibility of recasting."" She said it had been ""difficult, frustrating and at times painful"" that she was not able to speak to fans about the issues but added: ""The agreements that have been put in place to protect the privacy of two people, both of whom have expressed a desire to get on with their lives, must be respected. ""Based on our understanding of the circumstances, the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies. ""I've loved writing the first two screenplays and I can't wait for fans to see The Crimes Of Grindelwald. ""I accept that there will be those who are not satisfied with our choice of actor in the title role. However, conscience isn't governable by committee.""

NHS leaders and opposition politicians said the figures show NHS services are under extreme pressure even before demand is expected to peak over the coming months. The figures show that, on average, 10,184 patients every day waited for between 30 and 60 minutes in an ambulance before they were seen in hospital, with a daily average of 1,844 waiting more than an hour. :: Opinion - Confessions of an overworked NHS doctor General and acute bed occupancy, a key indicator of capacity, was running at 94.5%. Hospitals consider 85% occupancy a safe level. There were four flu-related deaths in England during the week. The figures do show some improvement on the previous week, results for which were held back, when 39 hospitals activated A&E diverts and more than 10,600 people waited up to an hour. Unlike previous years, NHS England has chosen not to publish total attendance at A&E departments, or the number of hospitals classified as ""under pressure"" because they have triggered one of the two highest levels of ""escalation"" in response to demand. The figures comes as NHS hospital trusts warned that the most extensive winter planning ever undertaken may be undermined, and patients put at risk, by shortages of staff, beds and money. NHS Providers, which represents hospital, ambulance and mental health trusts, said its members were already severely stretched, with bed occupancy in some trusts running at 98%, and significant delays in transferring patients out of hospital reducing the capacity for new admissions. Speaking to Sky News at Newham University Hospital, Barts Health chief medical officer Alistair Chesser said local co-operation was helping them cope with demand. He said: ""Winter has definitely arrived, we've noticed that. We had 530 attendances here in Newham on Monday, our normal rate is about 430, so you can see that the numbers are going up. ""But we saw 97% of people within four hours yesterday which is a terrific performance by this hospital, so we are coping."" Labour and the Liberal Democrats said the ambulance figures were evidence of Government underfunding. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour's shadow health secretary, said: ""Today's data reveals a stark picture of what lies ahead: a winter of misery for patients and unparalleled pressures on our NHS staff. ""Some Trusts are already completely full with no spare beds - an extremely worrying indicator for what is still to come particularly after NHS Improvement's explicit warning that ambulance handover delays 'should not occur'."" Lib Dem former health minister Norman Lamb said: ""These completely unacceptable delays are a long-running problem that the Government is failing to address, and they are getting worse. ""There is no doubt that lives are being lost as a result of these pressures."" In a statement, NHS England said: ""The NHS has prepared for winter this year more intensely than ever before, developing robust plans to manage expected increased pressures, as well as create contingency plans to cover exceptional surges in demand. ""The public can continue to play their part by making sure they have their flu jab and by using local pharmacies and NHS 111 for medical advice, alongside other services."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: ""The NHS has more robust plans in place than ever to cope with winter supported by £435m and £1bn funding for the social care system this year. ""The plans include an unprecedented system-wide push for all NHS workers to have the flu jab, aimed at helping to protect patients in hospitals and in the community."""

It had been hoped that construction would get under way by 2016, but so far the stadium is yet to be granted planning permission. Its failure to be used as a venue for the Euros could mean it never actually gets built, as the €300m due to be pumped into the project was partly dependent on the stadium being granted hosting rights. Koen De Brabander, chief executive of the Belgian Football Association, said in a statement: ""We did everything we could until the last moment to make UEFA hold off, but we respect the decision. ""Missing out on Euro 2020 does not necessarily mean a death blow for our stadium plans. We absolutely need a new 45,000-seat stadium and we hope that the competent ministers will grant the permit in January so that a stadium for the 21st century can finally be built in our country."" The Eurostadium was due to replace the King Baudouin Stadium, the renamed Heysel Stadium, where 39 spectators died in 1985 in unrest ahead of the European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus."
2017-12-07,A close friend of the Manchester bomber has been found guilty of being an Islamic State sniper after he was identified in official IS documents obtained by Sky News.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171208004248/https://news.sky.com/story/manchester-bombers-friend-found-guilty-of-being-is-sniper-11160191,"Mohammed Abdallah, 26, from Manchester, travelled to Syria with three friends in July 2014. His wheelchair-bound brother Abdalraouf, 24, stayed in the UK and directed them from the family home in Moss Side, south Manchester. Abdallah spent two years fighting for the terror group in the Middle East before returning to the UK in September 2016 and being arrested at Heathrow Airport. The Old Bailey heard that Abdallah was known to the authorities after Sky News obtained thousands of documents containing names, addresses and contact details of registered IS fighters. Abdallah's form was one of thousands of files passed on to counter-terrorism officers at Scotland Yard, and was the primary evidence used to convict him. It was the first prosecution of its kind. Speaking after the conviction, head of North West Counter Terrorism Dominic Scally said: ""The file itself and being able to attribute that to Mohammed Abdallah was a really important piece of evidence for us."" The trial heard that the Abdallah brothers learned their fighting skills when they fought for anti-Gaddafi forces in the 2011 Libyan uprising. The younger of the Abdallahs - Abdalraouf - was shot and paralysed fighting in the conflict. The battle-hardened brothers hatched a plan with their friends upon their return to Manchester to join IS. Abdallah travelled from Manchester to the Middle East in the summer of 2014 with three other men from south Manchester - Nezar Khalifa, 27, Raymond Matimba, 28, and Stephen Gray, 34, who previously served with the RAF in Iraq. Gray, who was stopped and arrested at a Turkish border in 2014, and Abdalraouf Abdallah, both from Moss Side, were jailed in 2016 after being convicted of terror offences. During Mohammed Abdallah's three-week trial, jurors were shown an IS registration form containing his name, nickname, date of birth and nationality and previous experience which all matched. The file showed that he was listed as a ""fighter"" and specialised as a ""sniper"". The supermarket worker-turned-jihadist was found guilty of being member of a proscribed organisation, receiving £2,000 for terrorism and possessing a firearm."
2017-12-07,"Brexit could cause chaos at Britain's borders, with not enough parking spaces for lorries awaiting customs checks and problems with IT systems, according to MPs.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171208004248/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-could-spark-uk-borders-chaos-mps-warn-11161038,"Parliament's spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), claims borders could be exposed to risks immediately after Brexit because of a lack of planning. The MPs claim border checks on people entering the UK could treble after the UK leaves the EU and checks on lorries could quadruple, yet Government planning is ""not fit for purpose"". And they say it is ""extremely worrying"" that Government departments expect little change at UK borders after withdrawal in March 2019, even if no exit deal is agreed with the EU. ""We are very concerned that their assumptions are risky and do not allow for changes in behaviours by companies trading across the border, or people crossing it,"" says the committee in a highly critical report. ""Particularly in the event of a no-deal scenario, the border could be exposed to risks on day one of the UK's departure. ""Officials are relying too much on there being a transitional period in order to have the time to develop the new systems and infrastructure that may be required. ""The current negotiations bring significant uncertainty, but the new Border Planning Group and Government departments need to step up and be prepared for the possibility of a no-deal scenario and for the costs of all potential options."" The committee is worried that the Government's Border Planning Group does not expect to have any extra border infrastructure, such as additional parking bays at ports for lorries, in place by Brexit day in March 2019. Another concern is that not all new and updated IT systems required as a result of Brexit will be up and running by the withdrawal date either. ""Government departments' poor track record of delivering critical border programmes, such as e-borders, leaves us sceptical that they are up to the challenges of planning for the border post-Brexit, including having enough people to manage it,"" says the committee in its report. Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, hit out at the Government's approach, stating: ""Against the hard deadline of Brexit it is borderline reckless - an over-reliance on wishful thinking that risks immediately exposing the UK to an array of damaging scenarios. ""Last month, we reported on the threat of chaos if HMRC's new customs system is not ready in time for Brexit and there is no viable fall-back option. ""We were deeply concerned by the lack of progress on this back-up plan. It is now alarming to note such weak contingency planning extends across Government departments. ""The volume of traffic at the border under current arrangements is substantial: in 2016, around 300 million people and 500 million tons of freight crossed it. ""After Brexit, the number of decisions required about people or goods crossing could more than treble and more than quadruple respectively. ""These figures should concern all in Government and in our view its current approach is not fit for purpose."""
2017-12-07,"As deals in the UK's commercial property sector go, they don't come much bigger than this.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171208004248/https://news.sky.com/story/the-34bn-deal-to-secure-shopping-centre-dominance-11158649,"Britain's two biggest shopping centre operators have announcerd plans to join forces in a deal that could transform the retail landscape. Hammerson, the owner of shopping centres including the Bullring in Birmingham, Brent Cross in north London and Cabot Circus in Bristol, is buying rival Intu, whose sites include the famous Lakeside centre in Thurrock, Essex, as well as the Trafford Centre and Arndale in Manchester, Braehead in Glasgow and the famous Metro Centre in Gateshead. The £3.4bn all-share deal will make Hammerson the UK's biggest property company as the two businesses, on Tuesday night's closing share prices, had a combined stock market value of £7.3bn. The deal also says much about the changing nature of shopping in this country. Traditional shopping, in 'bricks and mortar' stores, is under siege like never before by online. The assault, exacerbated by crushing business rates and the imposition of the National Living Wage, has seen many British high streets wither as a result - with many stalwart retailers shutting up shop and leaving the field to charity shops, estate agents, bookmakers and coffee shops. The argument of shopping centre operators like Hammerson and Intu has been that, as high streets lose their attractiveness to retailers, well-presented shopping centres in prime locations, offering an all-round experience for consumers including dining and entertainment, would continue to thrive. That has generally proved to be the case. The big battalions of UK retail - the likes of John Lewis, Next and Marks & Spencer - have been willing to position themselves as 'anchor tenants' in prime shopping centres. Sites like some of those mentioned above have continued to do well. But shopping centres in secondary locations have not done as well and have found themselves being offloaded by the major property players. Yet City investors have been unconvinced by the story. Shares in the likes of Hammerson and Intu have been trading at a significant discount to their 'net asset value' - crudely put, the sum shareholders would receive if a company was to wind itself up, sell all its assets and return the proceeds - for quite some time because investors have convinced themselves that traditional retailing is a dead duck and that the future lies online. Prior to today's news, shares of Intu had fallen by just under 30% since the beginning of the year, despite the company continuing to increase its rental income and enjoying an occupancy rate of more than 95% in its UK sites. Before news of today's deal, its shares stood at just 199p each, compared with a net asset value of 404p at the half-year stage. Allied to this turnaround in sentiment has been the way the City has fallen over itself to invest in property firms that are perceived as having exposure to online shopping. So Segro, whose assets mainly consist of warehouses in Greater London, the Thames Valley and the Midlands, has seen its share price rise by just under 20% so far this year. Those warehouses store goods being shipped around the country in online retail transactions and, accordingly, it is seen as a beneficiary of changing shopping habits. Symbolically, when Intu dropped out of the FTSE-100 in May this year, its place was taken by Segro. Adding to the depression in sentiment has been concerns of a post-Brexit downturn in consumer spending. So this takeover of Intu - a takeover made possible by the weakness in Intu's share price - is a response to the concerns of investors as well as a chance for Hammerson to bulk up. The question is whether the Competition & Markets Authority will choose to intervene. The combined business will dominate the shopping centre market in certain parts of the country, notably the West Midlands, where the Bullring competes with Intu's Merry Hill centre just up the road in Dudley. It may well insist on some disposals being made. Retailers will be anxious at the formation of such a major player dominating the shopping centre sector. This is also far from a 'pure play' British retail operator. Hammerson has assets in France and Ireland while Intu owns shopping centres in Spain. Some investors, though, may welcome that as a hedge against Brexit. This is a big, bold deal and a big, bold response to the depression in shareholder sentiment towards shopping centres and traditional retailing. How retailers themselves respond will be fascinating to watch."

After arriving back in the UK on Thursday, he said: ""Four long years of not being able to see me mam, it's the best Christmas present I could ever wish for. ""Every day for the past two years while I've been in prison I wanted nothing but this moment. And I'm really really happy."" When asked what he was going to do now, he said: ""I'm going to really relax with me family - a lovely hot bubble bath is on the cards for tonight. It's something simple that we all take for granted. ""Everyone who's campaigned for me, I'm overwhelmed, it's support basically that's got me through this dark period of my life. ""Without them, I don't know where I would have been, so I really, really thank the British public for their support.""

And when we got told the decision would be on the 27th (November), I knew deep down in my heart that I would be home for Christmas. And I am, home for Christmas."" The men, known as the Chennai Six, were jailed in October 2013 while working as security guards on a ship to combat piracy in the Indian Ocean. Indian authorities were said to have found 35 guns and almost 6,000 rounds of ammunition, which they claimed had not been properly declared. But after a four-year legal battle, the men - who have consistently denied the charges - were found not guilty by India's Appeal Court. The detained men were Mr Dunn, 31, Billy Irving, 37, John Armstrong, 30, Nicholas Simpson, 47, Ray Tindall, 42, and Paul Towers, 54. They were among 35 men arrested while working aboard the MV Seaman Guard Ohio, a vessel owned by a US company offering armed protection services to ships travelling between the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. The charges were overturned when the men showed papers for the weapons had been issued by the British government and that they were lawfully held for anti-piracy security. However, a lower court in India reinstated the charges against the men, leading to their conviction in January 2016, when they were sentenced to five years."

The jobs are among 12,000 being cut worldwide as the company slashes costs. GE currently employs 18,000 people in the UK and the cuts represent 6% of the workforce in this country. The company set out the plans to its staff on Thursday. Mark Elborne, head of GE UK and Ireland, said: ""Unfortunately, we believe that these changes are necessary to ensure that we can remain competitive and secure the future of GE Power in the UK."" GE said the changes were ""driven by challenges in the power market worldwide"". It added: ""Traditional power markets including gas and coal have softened. ""Volumes are down significantly in products and services driven by overcapacity, lower utilisation, fewer outages, an increase in steam plant retirements and overall growth in renewables. ""To get back to competitiveness GE Power needs to remove cost substantially from its business."" Its power division provides services and technology such as turbines, boilers and water systems to the industry. GE said the restructuring would ""simplify, consolidate and improve the efficiency of"" research and development across its products. But Unite union national officer ,Linda McCulloch, responded: ""General Electric is in danger of cutting too far, too fast and leaving itself ill equipped to meet the challenges of the changing power generation market. ""These proposals will be a shock for General Electric's loyal workforce and deal a major blow to the Midlands' economy which will be deprived of highly skilled well paid jobs because of this announcement. ""Over the coming days and weeks, Unite will be supporting our members and scrutinising the company's business case as we fight to save as many jobs as possible.

""Talks are continuing throughout the night,"" commission spokesperson Margaritis Schinas tweeted. ""Early morning meeting possible with press/point thereafter. Tonight more than ever, stay tuned."" Meanwhile, a No 10 spokesperson said were talks were ""ongoing"". It comes as European Council president Donald Tusk has scheduled a Brexit-related press briefing at 6.50am GMT on Friday morning. The EU has given Theresa May three days to solve the Irish border deadlock and other initial divorce issues, otherwise Brexit negotiations will not move on to trade talks before the end of the year. The Prime Minister looked set to reach an agreement in Brussels on Monday, only to see DUP leader Arlene Foster withdraw her support over fears of regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit. Brexit negotiators in Brussels, Dublin and London are working on a revised text of that near-deal, according to Irish MEP Brian Hayes. ""It's not that the text is changed in substance from the original but that it might be modified somewhat, new language, but as we speak those negotiations are continuing and have intensified,"" the Fine Gael politician told RTE.

Despite the difficulties facing the Prime Minister ahead of Brussels' looming deadline, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling insisted he was ""very optimistic"" about the hopes of a Brexit agreement. Speaking to Sky News, the Cabinet minister played down suggestions Mrs May should walk away from negotiations if talks did not progress. He said: ""Nobody should expect us to sign up to a bad deal for Britain, but I'm very optimistic about this. ""I think we want an agreement. All my conversations with other European ministers suggests they want an agreement. I'm sure we'll get there."" Answering questions after a speech on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was time for Britain and the EU to ""get going"" on the second phase of talks. He said: ""That's the exciting bit. That's the bit where we will achieve a new trading relationship with our friends and partners. ""We can get it done, we just need to get on with it, and I hope very much that the December European Council will mark that progress."""
2017-12-07,Violent protests have broken out across the West Bank and Gaza Strip following Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171208004248/https://news.sky.com/story/growing-backlash-after-trumps-recognition-of-jerusalem-as-israeli-capital-11159662,"Sky's Middle East Correspondent Alex Rossi, who is in Ramallah, said ""the air is thick with the smoke of burning tyres"" - with ambulance crews arriving at the scene where people are using makeshift slings to throw stones at the Israeli defence forces. ""People here are now talking about the possibility of a third Intifada, the Arab word for an uprising,"" he added. :: Analysis: Trump not averse to dangerous gamble with Jerusalem recognition Rossi described the situation on the ground as ""extremely volatile"" - adding that Israeli troops are firing tear gas and sponge bullets into the crowd. Around a dozen people have suffered minor injuries in demonstrations in the West Bank, Palestinian officials say, with hundreds of protesters taking to the streets. In Gaza, people burned posters of Donald Trump to protest against his decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and plans to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the city. The US President went ahead with his Middle East policy shift, despite leaders from around the world warning Mr Trump it could increase tensions in the region and damage the Middle East peace process. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he was rallying international opposition to what he called an ""unacceptable crime"", adding there has been a ""positive response"" to his overtures. In a rare public statement, Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu said ""God is weeping over President Donald Trump's inflammatory and discriminatory"" decision and that it was duty of the world ""to tell Mr Trump he is wrong"". Ismail Haniyeh, leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, earlier called for a new uprising - with Israel's army deploying reinforcements in the West Bank. Hamas said the decision ""opened the gates of hell"" on US interests in the Middle East. As both sides traded blows, Mr Trump was occupying himself by urging his Twitter followers to ""go get the new book on Andrew Jackson"" by Fox News presenter Brian Kilmeade. ""Really good,"" the commander-in-chief tweeted. Saudi Arabia slammed the move as ""irresponsible"" and warned there will be violence - and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that Mr Trump had put the Middle East into a ""ring of fire"". Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the US had ""pulled the pin on a bomb ready to blow in the region"". Iran warned it would ""provoke Muslims"" and lead to an ""increase in radical, angry and violent behaviour"". British Prime Minister Theresa May said she disagreed with the move and said the status of Jerusalem ""should be determined in a negotiated settlement"" between both sides, adding it ""should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told Sky News Arabia the UK had a ""moral duty"" to help resolve the dispute in Jerusalem, adding: ""The US is the preeminent power that can now show leadership."" The Kremlin said Mr Trump's decision was causing a split in the international community, while France's Emmanuel Macron described it as ""regrettable"". President Trump, however, has insisted his decision is simply ""recognition of reality"" and ""the right thing to do"". Changes around the sensitive city of Jerusalem - a holy site for Muslims, Jews and Christians - risk scuppering attempts by Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to broker an Arab-Israeli peace agreement. Egypt, which was the first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, also rejected the US President's declaration, while Jordan dismissed it as ""legally null"" because it consolidated Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians see as the capital of any future state. The decision has been largely welcomed in Israel, which has long considered Jerusalem to be its capital, after it annexed the Old City in 1967. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised America's ""courageous and just decision"" and said it was a ""historic day"". Following the decision, American government personnel have been warned to avoid the Old City and the West Bank until further notice. An updated ""Worldwide Caution"" has also been issued to US citizens abroad, advising them to ""be alert to the possibility of political unrest, violence, demonstrations, and criminal activities""."

""We stand ready to receive Prime Minister May at any moment in time when they are ready."" The DUP torpedoed Mrs May's efforts to reach an agreement during her trip to Brussels on Monday, with Arlene Foster pulling her party's support over concerns at the wording of a draft text she feared would agree regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit. Mrs May spoke with both the DUP leader and the Republic of Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Wednesday in her attempt to salvage a deal with the EU. Her efforts appeared to be further complicated on Thursday when Foreign Secretary and Vote Leave figurehead Boris Johnson warned any Brexit deal must respect promises made during the EU referendum campaign. ""It is very, very important that whatever happens now, whatever we agree, has got to be consistent with taking back control of our laws, of our borders and our cash,"" he said. Without an agreement from EU leaders at next week's European Council summit, Brexit negotiations will not move on to trade talks before the New Year. Sky News' Europe Correspondent Mark Stone said: ""This is effectively the third deadline issued by the EU. ""The first loose deadline was the October summit, when both sides hoped the 'sufficient progress' test on phase one of the negotiations would be met. ""When that failed to happen, the deadline was shifted to the December summit. ""In order to meet the December summit, the UK was given a 10-day deadline on 24 November. That ran out last Monday. The new deadline is this Sunday. ""In reality, this deadline could be moved too. But there are political limits to what the EU can do because each member state will want to see the draft text first before deciding anything.

All my conversations with other European ministers suggests they want an agreement. ""I'm sure we'll get there."" However, Mr Grayling voiced his disagreement with a House of Lords report published on Thursday, which stated that a no-deal Brexit would ""deeply damage"" the UK. ""Britain's going to succeed come what may,"" the Leave-supporting MP said. He also appeared to contradict Chancellor Philip Hammond's suggestion the UK would still hand over a Brexit divorce fee of up to £50bn even if there was no final withdrawal agreement. Mr Grayling said: ""We and the EU have said nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Until that point there isn't an agreement to fulfil."" The Prime Minister has come under pressure from her backbenchers not to leave the UK too closely aligned to the EU after Brexit. It follows suggestions closer ties with Brussels in some economic areas have been proposed as a means of ensuring there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. Amid the ongoing discussions between Dublin, Belfast, Brussels and London, Conservative backbencher Bernard Jenkin claimed the Irish Government was ""being played like a harp"" by the European Commission. He told BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: ""Dublin is being used as a proxy by the EU. ""The EU is extremely worried about setting the precedent that you can leave the EU and you can have an invisible frontier."" Mr Jenkin also warned the UK ""shouldn't be allowing ourselves to be bullied into promising more and more money or giving up the goal of regulatory autonomy"" after Brexit. On the other side of the Tory divide on Brexit, prominent Remain supporter Anna Soubry has called for the Government to give MPs the power to seek an extension to negotiations if a satisfactory trade agreement isn't reached by March 2019."

2017-12-07,"The driver of a tram which crashed, killing seven people, may have momentarily fallen asleep in the seconds before the accident.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171208004248/https://news.sky.com/story/driver-microsleep-may-have-caused-tram-crash-that-killed-seven-people-11160055,"The official report into the crash in Croydon, south London, confirms that the accident was caused by a driver failing to apply the brakes in time to negotiate a sharp bend. It concludes that he may have lost awareness or had what is described as a ""microsleep"" because of fatigue. The report also reveals that there was a similar speeding incident less than two weeks before the deadly crash. Seven passengers died and 69 others were injured in the accident on 9 November 2016. Only one person aboard the tram was unhurt. The tram should have slowed to 20km per hour to take a left turn into the Sandilands tram stop. Instead, it was travelling at 73km per hour - almost four times the speed limit. As the tram overturned, survivors reported that they were tossed around like ""being inside a washing machine"". The dead and most seriously injured were thrown through shattered windows and were crushed under the tram as it skidded to a halt. The official report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) concluded that even though the driver had eight years' experience, and had made the same journey around 700 times in the previous two years, he may have lost awareness because he had little to do in the minute immediately before the crash. The report says there is no evidence that he was tired because of the shift pattern he was required to work. A small sign just before the bend indicated that the speed limit was 20km per hour, but the driver braked too late. The report describes how, on 31 October, a passenger emailed Tram Operations Limited to complain that she had been injured when a driver took the same bend too fast. The complaint was still being assessed by staff at the time of the fatal accident 10 days later, but the driver involved in the earlier incident told investigators that he was reluctant to report the incident himself in case he was suspended from duty. Investigators don't believe that reporting of the earlier incident would have prevented the fatal accident because the operator would not have fully realised how close the tram came to overturning on that occasion. Unlike trains, trams rely heavily on the judgement of drivers to judge their own speed given varying circumstances on their journey. The report recommends that there should be a mechanism to automatically apply the brakes when a tram is travelling too fast. It also concludes that the signage was inadequate and need to be improved, and windows and doors should be strengthened. There were no emergency exits and passengers had to escape through the windscreen of the cab. The report recommends here should be a more open culture of reporting mistakes and learning from them. Signage was improved within days of the accident and before the tramway reopened. The driver has not been named in the report, but is currently on police bail having been interviewed on suspicion of manslaughter."
2017-12-07,"The UK has one of the worst levels of recorded acid attacks in the world, police have revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171208004248/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-among-worlds-worst-for-acid-attacks-11160351,"New statistics suggest there are now more than 800 reported attacks a year, but investigators believe the crime is under-reported. Police say the public needs to understand the terrible impact of attacks which can kill or hideously maim victims for life. The incidents dwarf official figures for India, where acid attacks have been a form of punishment and revenge for decades, though under-reporting is widespread there and elsewhere in South-East Asia. Police and politicians are trying to understand the rise of attacks in Britain with two research studies, planned legislation and education initiatives. :: Amber Rudd to ban acid sales to under-18s Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Kearton called for a new law to criminalise the carrying of corrosive substances to match knife laws. And she urged scientists to develop a street testing kit for police officers who find suspicious liquids during stop and search operations. ACC Kearton said: ""We are talking low numbers, compared with the annual 32,000 knife attacks, but it is a worrying increase and we need to understand the reasons why. ""I fear it's a crime that is under-reported, often by people in a domestic situation who are afraid of reprisals, or young gang members who are worried about a comeback if they speak to police."" She is leading a study of victims and attackers on behalf of the National Police Chiefs Council. (NPCC) The analysis will be published in the Spring and is expected to help shape new laws. Carrying acid and corrosive substances, many of which are sold on the high street and in routine use in homes, is currently not a crime, unless police can prove an intention to use it in a crime. Ms Kearton wants a new law to put the onus on the person carrying the substance to prove a legitimate use. She said there were around 20 substances, from sulphuric acid to household bleach, that had been used in attacks. Victims were largely men, aged 26 to 35, but evidence showed younger males were being targeted. Acid and corrosive substances were being used in domestic violence, hate crime and robbery, mostly in urban areas but increasingly in rural settings."
2017-12-07,"Kenny Alexander, the chief executive of gaming firm GVC Holdings, is known to like a flutter.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171208004248/https://news.sky.com/story/the-gambler-driving-gvcs-bid-for-ladbrokes-coral-11160038,"He proved it again today when the company he heads - which owns brands including Foxy Bingo, Sportingbet, CasinoClub, Cashcade and Party Poker - tabled a bid for Ladbrokes Coral. Scotsman Mr Alexander has already tried twice during the last year to snare Ladbrokes Coral. He is clearly hoping that this will be a case of third time lucky. What is unusual about the timing of today's announcement is that, while GVC had always been expected to have another tilt at Ladbrokes, the assumption was that it would wait until the Government had completed its review of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) - the lucrative but highly controversial gaming machines that sit in every high street bookmaker. :: Ladbrokes Coral in talks on takeover by GVC The review is likely to impose a lower maximum stake per spin on the machines which, depending on how low the figure is, is likely to take a chunk out of the profits of bookmakers. Accordingly, GVC could have been forgiven for waiting a while to see what the Department for Culture, Media and Sport came up with, not least because confusion over the issue has clouded previous negotiations over how to value Ladbrokes. GVC's solution has been to come up with a clever formula under which the eventual sum it pays will depend on the outcome of the review and values Ladbrokes at anywhere between £3.1bn and £3.9bn. The combined business is expected to be worth some £5.7bn and would qualify for membership of the FTSE 100. Yet only as recently as September, Mr Alexander - who has taken GVC from being an Aim-listed minnow to a £2.75bn member of the FTSE 250 in a decade - was insisting he would ""definitely...not be doing anything before the outcome of the review"". What will startle casual observers is the way in which GVC, a 13-year old business few outside the City will have heard of, is in a position to snaffle an established company boasting two of the best-known names in the industry. Joe Coral, after all, launched his bookmaking business 91 years ago while Ladbrokes dates back even further, to 1886. That reflects dramatic changes in the gaming industry, in particular the explosive growth of online betting, but also the rapid growth of GVC itself via a series of mergers and acquisitions. Founded in 2004, as Luxembourg-based Gaming VC Holdings, its meteoric growth began when, in March 2007, Kilmarnock-supporting Mr Alexander - who will head the combined GVC and Ladbrokes - became chief executive. After a string of smaller deals, the first big one came when, in 2013, GVC teamed up with William Hill to buy the online sports betting business Sportingbet. Then, in 2015, it outbid rival 888 Holdings to pay £1.1bn for Bwin.Party, a fallen star of the gaming sector formed from the merger of the former Real Madrid shirt sponsor Bwin and the former FTSE 100 member PartyGaming. This was the boldest roll of the dice yet for Mr Alexander as, at the time, Bwin.Party was more than twice the size of GVC. Again, as with Sportingbet, he and his colleagues proved adept at successfully integrating another business. But Ladbrokes Coral, even at the lower end of the price range being mooted, is a much bigger beast than anything GVC has previously taken on and, like Bwin.Party, it is larger than GVC itself. Moreover, unlike Sportingbet and Bwin.Party, it is not a purely digital business but one boasting physical assets in the form of 3,700 high street betting shops. Mr Alexander has, in the recent past, made clear his preference for acquiring online gaming businesses ahead of ones owning bookmaking shops because the former tend to be more highly valued by investors than the latter. By contrast, he was today talking about how the ""enlarged group would be an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business that would benefit from a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy"". Aside from Mr Alexander's apparent conversion to the joys of high street betting shops, this deal raises several questions. One is whether this deal fires the starting pistol on another round of consolidation in the betting industry. Betfair has already joined forces with Paddy Power but the likes of 888 Holdings, William Hill, Jackpotjoy and Canadian firm Stars Group, owner of the PokerStars website, are all expected to participate in further tie-ups. So too could Mecca bingo and Grosvenor casino operator Rank and SkyBet, in which Sky plc, the parent of Sky News, has a minority shareholding. At least as intriguing is how Bet365 - along with GVC and Paddy Power Betfair, one of the three biggest global players in online sports betting - reacts to all this. And the biggest question of all is whether the DCMS could yet disrupt the industrial logic of this deal by confounding everyone with its review of FOBTs."

He told the Commons Brexit select committee at a hearing in Co Armagh: ""They have a focus on this. They see it as an opportunity. ""Infrastructure on the border would be an obvious point for dissident groups to rally around and attack."" DCC Harris added it was regrettable that many discussions of the border ""take us back to the 80s"". He said the threat from dissident republicans remains severe, revealing there were four attempts on the life of police officers in the last 12 months. 32 bombing incidents and 58 shootings were also reported. And he raised concern about shared police and intelligence systems between the UK and Ireland being lost after Brexit. ""The systems are for a safer Europe. It is not a one-way street. We have a lot to offer our European partners after Brexit. ""We are unsure of what the landscape is going to look like going forward.

""That has to be backed up with legislation and policy which allows intelligence and evidence to be shared quickly."" Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin, head of the PSNI's serious and organised crime branch, said his organisation and the Irish Garda worked together ""across a whole spectrum of crime"". Former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain responded: ""A hard border on the island of Ireland would play into the hands of those seeking to destroy the peaceful settlement achieved by the Good Friday Agreement, which has provided relative stability for 20 years and put the horror and terror behind us."" The UK Government is stuck trying to placate the Democratic Unionist Party and Ireland over its plans for Northern Ireland post-Brexit. It has been given a deadline of up until the end of the week to make concessions for negotiations to move on to trade this year."

2017-12-07,Democrats have quizzed Jared Kushner over a $1.15bn (£860m) mortgage on a loss-making Manhattan property - suggesting it could pose a conflict of interest for the President's son-in-law.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171208004248/https://news.sky.com/story/trumps-son-in-law-jared-kushner-questioned-over-115bn-mortgage-11159915,"A group of 13 lawmakers tabled a letter asking if financing for the property had been mentioned in talks between Mr Kushner and foreign delegates. Kushner Companies owns at least half of 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which in the decade since its purchase has proved a significant financial drain. The underoccupied tower will bring expected $24m (£18m) this year, and the debt on the property is due in two years. Mr Kushner was head of Kushner Companies until he sold the interest to a family trust earlier this year. Before he joined the administration, he sought help from foreign investors over the troublesome tower block, meeting with South Korean and Chinese executives to discuss buy-ins. According to Bloomberg, the company hopes to replace the 1950s office block with luxury flats, a hotel and a large shopping mall - but the grand aspirations have floundered after limited support from its partners. :: Do Jared Kushner's answers and alibis convince? Now an adviser to President Trump, Mr Kushner is being questioned over possible collusion between Russia and Trump's successful 2016 presidential campaign. It is not known whether the debt on the property at number 666 is being investigated by the inquiry. In the letter to Mr Kushner, lawmakers said they were ""concerned"" that he may be leveraging his ""White House position to seek financial assistance"" for the property. They asked whether he had discussed help for finance, purchase or debt assistance to the building with any foreign nationals or entities since the election of his father-in-law in November 2016. Saudi Arabia, China, Israel and France were suggested as countries of interest. Enquiries into Mr Kushner have so far found he was present at a back-room meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer, which Donald Trump Jr had organised in the hope of uncovering information that might be damaging to Hillary Clinton. This week, US media named Mr Kushner as the White House official who had directed Michael Flynn to reach out to Russia as part of an attempt to delay a UN resolution on Israeli settlements. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the issue and Mr Kushner's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, could not be reached for comment. Mr Trump has denied any collusion between the Kremlin and his presidential campaign. The lawmakers asked Mr Kushner to respond by 12 December."
2017-12-08,"Senior members of Theresa May's government have backed her breakthrough deal in the Brexit talks, which includes paying more than £30bn to Brussels.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/cabinet-heavyweights-back-pms-brexit-breakthrough-deal-11161938,"The agreement on the size of the so-called ""divorce bill"", along with guarantees on citizens' rights and the status of the Irish border after Brexit, came after a night of frantic diplomacy. Negotiators said it delivered the required ""sufficient progress"" to move on to the next phase of talks - but these are likely to be even tougher. :: Key points of the deal:: Analysis: Brexit fudge recipe might yet leave bad taste European Council President Donald Tusk warned the most difficult challenge is still ahead, adding: ""So much time has been devoted to the easiest part of the task. Now, to negotiate a transition arrangement and the framework for our future relationship we have de facto less than a year."" British Prime Minister Theresa May hailed the deal as a ""hard-won agreement in all our interests"" - and senior members of her top team have publicly backed her. While criticism among Leave-supporting MPs has been muted so far, there have been hints of some discontent. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal is the result of compromise and he is recommending EU leaders approve moving onto the next phase, which will cover the future trading relationship and the terms of the transition, at a summit next week. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted his congratulations to the PM, praising her ""determination in getting today's deal"". Congratulations to PM for her determination in getting today's deal. We now aim to forge a deep and special partnership with our European friends and allies while remaining true to the referendum result - taking back control of our laws, money and borders for the whole of the UK. Mr Johnson - a Vote Leave figurehead in the referendum campaign - had previously said the EU could ""go whistle"" if it asked for a hefty sum from Britain. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who like Mr Johnson campaigned for Leave, described it as a ""significant personal political achievement"" which will mean there is more money for the NHS. Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd also welcomed the news: Delighted a deal agreed in Brussels that paves way for further progress on talks about future UK/EU relationship. A positive step. Congratulations @theresa_may 1/2 Delighted we've reached an agreement which will give both Europeans here in the UK and British citizens in the EU binding guarantees about their residence rights. 2/2 I hope this will now give those concerned real peace of mind. We are building a new system so that the application process will be smooth and simple. For now, EU citizens in the UK, do not need to do anything. The breakthrough came after Mrs May and Brexit Secretary David Davis flew to Brussels to finalise the details of a joint document setting out proposals for the key divorce issues. Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, who blocked a previous agreement on Monday, was brought onside in the early hours of Friday. She said there had been ""substantial changes"" to the text which mean there will be ""no red line down the Irish Sea"" and no ""special status"" for Northern Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said it was a ""significant day"" for Ireland, with Dublin achieving ""all that we set out to achieve in phase one of these negotiations"". The size of the Brexit bill is significantly lower than was suggested, at an estimated £35bn-£39bn (€40-45bn). It will be paid over several years and the exact figure will not be known for some time. Sources told Sky News that the EU was seeking €60bn to €75bn euros (£53bn-£66bn). But while the breakthrough represents a victory for the PM, elements of the deal have caused disquiet. A particular source of comment is a passage that covers what happens on the island of Ireland in the event no trade deal is agreed. It says that the UK will keep ""full alignment"" with elements of the EU's single market and customs union which support the economy of the island of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement - something proponents of a clean break from Brussels are unlikely to be happy with. Former Brexit minister David Jones has warned this could hinder Britain's ability to sign free-trade deals with other nations. The European Court of Justice will continue to have a role overseeing EU citizens' rights in the UK for eight years after Brexit, something many Brexiteers view as anathema to ""taking back control"". Downing Street said only two or three cases a year are expected to be referred to the ECJ for ""interpretation"", adding that the court would not have the power to call in cases. The ""divorce bill"" has long been a source of controversy, with some arguing Britain should not be handing over such a large sum of money. Mrs May said the settlement would be ""fair to the British taxpayer"", but one senior Tory MP - speaking on condition of anonymity - told Sky News there would be ""incredible concern"" from the public. They added: ""It does make it much more difficult to make the case that we haven't got any money for public spending priorities at home."" On the ""full alignment"" issue, Mr Johnson appeared to try to placate potential concerns from the Conservative ranks. In response to a tweet from chief whip Julian Smith, which included a picture of him meeting Mrs May on Thursday, the Foreign Secretary said: Yes, great meeting with PM @theresa_may - found her totally determined that 'full alignment' means compatibility with taking back control of our money, laws and borders. Tory MPs Owen Paterson and John Redwood used Twitter to express their concerns: Big improvement on Monday text @EU_Commission has moved a long way. Still problematic areas inc Clause 49 (full alignment), role of ECJ & money. At last we are moving to free trade discussions. Problem areas must be debated & resolved. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed We need to remember that leaving on the WTO option means no add'l payments to the EU, whilst taking back control of our borders, our laws & our money. A good deal has to be better than this, otherwise the Government’s mantra that No Deal is better than a bad deal should apply. UKIP leader Nigel Farage was scathing, describing the deal as a ""capitulation"": The 17.4m did not vote for a large exit fee, the ECJ continuing to have a say over our country or a 2 year transition. This is not a deal, it's a capitulation. pic.twitter.com/cX9qrCi9iP Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal ""could have been done some time ago"" and called for more detail from Mrs May on the transition and ""what regulatory framework there will be in the future"". This echoes earlier comments from Mr Tusk, who asked for ""more clarity"" from Britain on what the future trading relationship will look like. ""While being satisfied with today's agreement, which is obviously a personal success for Prime Minister Theresa May, let us remember that the most difficult challenge is still ahead,"" he said. Under Mr Tusk's proposals, there will be a transition of around two years after March 2019. The UK will be required to respect EU law - including any legislation passed without Britain's involvement - observe budgetary commitments and the oversight of the ECJ."

With the country's A&E departments under huge pressure this winter, it is hoped that the miniature snacks will give wards a break from so-called ""avocado hand"". Earlier this year, plastic surgeon Simon Eccles suggested that avocados should carry warning labels following a rise in the number of knife injuries from cutting into the fruit, but M&S is confident its new offering will prove the ideal solution and suggests trying the traditionally healthy snack deep fried. M&S agronomist Charlotte Curtis said: ""We've had the mini, the giant, ready sliced and we're now launching the holy grail of avocados - stoneless. ""This amazing fruit has been on our radar for a couple of years and we're very excited to have finally been able to get hold of some for our customers to try.

Someone sure to be excited by the ""cocktail avocados"" is young Henry, whose polite reaction to receiving one of the fruits as a birthday present went viral in 2015. Avocados have surged in popularity in recent years, particularly among hipsters and millennials. Back in May wonky variants were added to the line-up at supermarket Morrisons in a bid to make them more affordable. It came as the global price of avocados reached record levels due to flooding and drought, late harvests and worker strikes in grower areas. Avocados are packed with essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin E, vitamin K, folate and antioxidants - and contain more potassium per gram than bananas. They are high in omega 3 fatty acids, which can help to lower cholesterol and improve heart health, and can be good for weight loss as they release slow burning energy, reducing hunger."

His wheelchair-bound brother Abdalraouf, 24, stayed in the UK and directed them from the family home in Moss Side, south Manchester. Abdallah spent two years fighting for the terror group in the Middle East before returning to the UK in September 2016 and being arrested at Heathrow Airport. The Old Bailey heard that Abdallah was known to the authorities after Sky News obtained thousands of documents containing names, addresses and contact details of registered IS fighters. Abdallah's form was one of thousands of files passed on to counter-terrorism officers at Scotland Yard, and was the primary evidence used to convict him. It was the first prosecution of its kind. Speaking after the conviction, head of North West Counter Terrorism Dominic Scally said: ""The file itself and being able to attribute that to Mohammed Abdallah was a really important piece of evidence for us."" The trial heard that the Abdallah brothers learned their fighting skills when they fought for anti-Gaddafi forces in the 2011 Libyan uprising. The younger of the Abdallahs - Abdalraouf - was shot and paralysed fighting in the conflict. The battle-hardened brothers hatched a plan with their friends upon their return to Manchester to join IS. Abdallah travelled from Manchester to the Middle East in the summer of 2014 with three other men from south Manchester - Nezar Khalifa, 27, Raymond Matimba, 28, and Stephen Gray, 34, who previously served with the RAF in Iraq. Gray, who was stopped and arrested at a Turkish border in 2014, and Abdalraouf Abdallah, both from Moss Side, were jailed in 2016 after being convicted of terror offences. During Mohammed Abdallah's three-week trial, jurors were shown an IS registration form containing his name, nickname, date of birth and nationality and previous experience which all matched. The file showed that he was listed as a ""fighter"" and specialised as a ""sniper"". The supermarket worker-turned-jihadist was found guilty of being member of a proscribed organisation, receiving £2,000 for terrorism and possessing a firearm."

It quickly escalated and the footage shows her using racial slurs and abusive language. She describes Mr Prince as ""an idiot"" and threatens to ""f****** slap"" him as he attempts to remove her feet from his seat, before descending into a bizarre dispute over the councillor's marriage. The row continues when Mr Prince makes a further attempt to remove the woman's feet from his seat. In his apology, he said: ""I regret getting involved in such a petty dispute.

He was also found guilty of possessing an AK-47 assault rifle and receiving £2,000 to fund terrorism. :: The IS Files: Unmasking Britain's terrorists Abdallah travelled to Syria with three friends in July 2014 and his wheelchair-bound brother Abdalraouf, 24, stayed in the UK and directed them from the family home in Moss Side, south Manchester, after being shot and paralysed while fighting in the conflict. He spent two years fighting for the terror group in the Middle East before returning to the UK in September 2016 and being arrested at Heathrow Airport. The Old Bailey heard that Abdallah was known to the authorities after Sky News obtained thousands of documents containing names, addresses and contact details of registered IS fighters. The file showed that the former supermarket worker was listed as a ""fighter"" and specialised as a ""sniper"". Abdallah was good friends with Manchester bomber Salman Abedi and they lived just streets away. They visited the Al-Rahman Islamic Centre in Moss Side together and members told Sky News they were ""horrified and sickened"" by how their former members turned out. In mitigation, Rajiv Menon QC said there was no evidence Abdallah was ""on a mission"" in the two years between leaving Syria after four weeks and the time his involvement with IS emerged, but he has been put behind bars for 10 years with five years on extended licence."
2017-12-08,"Kenny Alexander, the chief executive of gaming firm GVC Holdings, is known to like a flutter.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/the-gambler-driving-gvcs-bid-for-ladbrokes-coral-11160038,"He proved it again today when the company he heads - which owns brands including Foxy Bingo, Sportingbet, CasinoClub, Cashcade and Party Poker - tabled a bid for Ladbrokes Coral. Scotsman Mr Alexander has already tried twice during the last year to snare Ladbrokes Coral. He is clearly hoping that this will be a case of third time lucky. What is unusual about the timing of today's announcement is that, while GVC had always been expected to have another tilt at Ladbrokes, the assumption was that it would wait until the Government had completed its review of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) - the lucrative but highly controversial gaming machines that sit in every high street bookmaker. :: Ladbrokes Coral in talks on takeover by GVC The review is likely to impose a lower maximum stake per spin on the machines which, depending on how low the figure is, is likely to take a chunk out of the profits of bookmakers. Accordingly, GVC could have been forgiven for waiting a while to see what the Department for Culture, Media and Sport came up with, not least because confusion over the issue has clouded previous negotiations over how to value Ladbrokes. GVC's solution has been to come up with a clever formula under which the eventual sum it pays will depend on the outcome of the review and values Ladbrokes at anywhere between £3.1bn and £3.9bn. The combined business is expected to be worth some £5.7bn and would qualify for membership of the FTSE 100. Yet only as recently as September, Mr Alexander - who has taken GVC from being an Aim-listed minnow to a £2.75bn member of the FTSE 250 in a decade - was insisting he would ""definitely...not be doing anything before the outcome of the review"". What will startle casual observers is the way in which GVC, a 13-year old business few outside the City will have heard of, is in a position to snaffle an established company boasting two of the best-known names in the industry. Joe Coral, after all, launched his bookmaking business 91 years ago while Ladbrokes dates back even further, to 1886. That reflects dramatic changes in the gaming industry, in particular the explosive growth of online betting, but also the rapid growth of GVC itself via a series of mergers and acquisitions. Founded in 2004, as Luxembourg-based Gaming VC Holdings, its meteoric growth began when, in March 2007, Kilmarnock-supporting Mr Alexander - who will head the combined GVC and Ladbrokes - became chief executive. After a string of smaller deals, the first big one came when, in 2013, GVC teamed up with William Hill to buy the online sports betting business Sportingbet. Then, in 2015, it outbid rival 888 Holdings to pay £1.1bn for Bwin.Party, a fallen star of the gaming sector formed from the merger of the former Real Madrid shirt sponsor Bwin and the former FTSE 100 member PartyGaming. This was the boldest roll of the dice yet for Mr Alexander as, at the time, Bwin.Party was more than twice the size of GVC. Again, as with Sportingbet, he and his colleagues proved adept at successfully integrating another business. But Ladbrokes Coral, even at the lower end of the price range being mooted, is a much bigger beast than anything GVC has previously taken on and, like Bwin.Party, it is larger than GVC itself. Moreover, unlike Sportingbet and Bwin.Party, it is not a purely digital business but one boasting physical assets in the form of 3,700 high street betting shops. Mr Alexander has, in the recent past, made clear his preference for acquiring online gaming businesses ahead of ones owning bookmaking shops because the former tend to be more highly valued by investors than the latter. By contrast, he was today talking about how the ""enlarged group would be an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business that would benefit from a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy"". Aside from Mr Alexander's apparent conversion to the joys of high street betting shops, this deal raises several questions. One is whether this deal fires the starting pistol on another round of consolidation in the betting industry. Betfair has already joined forces with Paddy Power but the likes of 888 Holdings, William Hill, Jackpotjoy and Canadian firm Stars Group, owner of the PokerStars website, are all expected to participate in further tie-ups. So too could Mecca bingo and Grosvenor casino operator Rank and SkyBet, in which Sky plc, the parent of Sky News, has a minority shareholding. At least as intriguing is how Bet365 - along with GVC and Paddy Power Betfair, one of the three biggest global players in online sports betting - reacts to all this. And the biggest question of all is whether the DCMS could yet disrupt the industrial logic of this deal by confounding everyone with its review of FOBTs."
2017-12-08,"The Prime Minister will be delighted to have negotiated the Brexit process to this point of ""sufficient progress"" on initial divorce matters.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/pms-brexit-fudge-recipe-might-yet-leave-bad-taste-11161422,"But the progress, as well as being delayed by a couple of months, is not as far as she would have wanted. Immediate discussions will begin on a transition period, before talks about trade, which will still take some time to prepare internally by the 27 other EU member states. On Northern Ireland, the important point is Mrs May and her diplomats managed, in the early hours of Friday, to square off both Dublin and Belfast on the thorny issue of the Irish border. The change in words within Friday's agreed text were more about providing clarity rather than a fundamental change in the meaning of what had already been agreed on Monday. Instead of ""full regulatory alignment"", the new wording is ""full alignment with the rules"" of the EU's single market and customs union, which underpin the Good Friday Agreement and an open border. The recipe of the fudge has changed only a little, but sufficiently enough for the DUP to claim to have won ""six substantive changes"" to the wording. The key point is the position on Monday had left until the second phase of Brexit negotiations the precise degree of ""alignment"" required to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Dublin and Brussels believes this will be widespread, touching upon dozens of areas, but Belfast thinks it is just two or three. Over the past week the UK was quite literally negotiating with itself amid talks in Whitehall between the UK Government and Northern Ireland's DUP. The other substantive point of compromise in Friday's agreement is the length of a referral period for the European Court of Justice to enforce the rights of EU citizens. Both sides have compromised here. The EU asked for 15 years' of jurisdiction, the UK for five years. They have opted for eight years. It seems this is acceptable for Tory Brexiteers, but that is not what they were saying only a few months ago. This speaks to a wider truth. The real story of Brexit's first phase is how the Prime Minister has managed to get her own MPs to wear a series of compromises: on transition, sequencing, financial settlement, rights and potentially Ireland, too. Brexiteer MPs have shown that when push comes to shove, any Brexit is better than the risk of a Government collapse meaning no Brexit. Effectively, phase two negotiations are now for agreeing a transition period while phase three is for trade talks. A transition period will see Britain remain in the customs union and single market for two years. European Council President Donald Tusk revealed the UK has asked for this, but also warned it will mean Britain is obliged to accept new EU laws during the period. In practice, this will not change a great deal over the two years, but had previously been ruled out by Brexiteers. We are still some months from talking about trade, and years from actual trade talks. The really difficult stuff is now deciding the Brexit end state. Should it be high alignment and high access to the EU, such as a Norway-style deal? Or will it be low alignment and low access, such as a Canada-style trade deal? The question is whether the fall-back position for the Irish border of ""full alignment"" with the EU pre-configures that shape in some way. Logically one would presume so. If there's no deal, then we get full alignment. The idea that a deal would then see low alignment seems unlikely. But ministerial sources are adamant this is a red herring. They say Britain will enjoy full regulatory independence, there will be outcome equivalence but autonomy on reaching those outcomes, and the terms of Friday's deal on the Irish border are just a contingency. Longstanding Brexiteers would have preferred the word ""equivalence"" in Friday's agreement, and some trust has been lost by the fact this was not cleared in advance by the Cabinet sub-committee. They are still concerned and this will now be thrashed out in Cabinet as early as next week. The big winners here are the business community, who forced Number 10 to do whatever it takes to achieve a quickly agreed transition deal. That is why quick compromises were made by Mrs May. The second phase of negotiations will be even harder. A fudge only goes so far. It is an achievement for the Prime Minister to have got here. It is a significant achievement to have got the Cabinet and the DUP to sign up to this. But the real victory would be to get all her MPs on side. It is unclear if that is the case."

""Digital currency might be easier to gain than physical currency. So I think it's reasonable."" Bitcoin's value has risen dramatically over the course of 2017, but especially during the past week, peaking at one Bitcoin being worth $16,000 (£11,940). The currency's value is up 1,500% this year, driven by sheer speculation. Ms Shen and her colleagues have tracked attacks by hacking groups Lazarus, Bluenoroff and Andariel - suspected to be North Korean operations - on financial institutions including banks in Europe and South Korea, an ATM company and Bitcoin exchange. She told Sky News: ""Before, when we tracked nation-state attackers, they usually perform cyberattacks which are aimed for confidential data and intelligence. ""However recently we've discovered that some of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups are trying to hack financial institutions like banks and Bitcoin exchanges to gain financial profit."" Ms Shen said the attacks had so far been unsuccessful. ""My own opinion is they will probably keep doing the Bitcoins because the price keeps increasing and it's a good investment... So I assume they will do more Bitcoin attacks and of course they will keep targeting banks because that's what they did before."" :: Bitcoin crackdown as UK mulls cryptocurrency regulation One of her co-researchers, who wishes to remain anonymous because they work for a South Korean bank, told Sky News: ""Just a few years ago the attacks were initiated to paralyze the society, but for sometime now they've been hacking for money - so I kind of wonder if they are facing financial difficulties."" As Bitcoin has surged in value, particularly over the last week, it has become increasingly attractive to hackers.

The National Crime Agency told Sky News: ""The vast majority of cryptocurrency use is not criminal. Bitcoin is one of more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies and many people use cryptocurrencies to bank or to transfer money or make investments. ""We do see cybercriminals using cryptocurrencies as one of a range of ways in which criminals try to launder money. ""But criminals are mistaken if they believe that cryptocurrencies are untraceable and provide total anonymity. ""Many dark web and online marketplaces where illegal commodities are bought and sold rely on cryptocurrencies. The NCA conducts operations against criminal activity on the dark web and is alert to criminal threats which rely on its use. ""We're also seeing that traditional crime groups are starting to use the Bitcoin network to store and transfer value, and using ATMs and peer-to-peer exchanges to cash in or out of the network."""

Police say the public needs to understand the terrible impact of attacks which can kill or hideously maim victims for life. The incidents dwarf official figures for India, where acid attacks have been a form of punishment and revenge for decades, though under-reporting is widespread there and elsewhere in South-East Asia. Police and politicians are trying to understand the rise of attacks in Britain with two research studies, planned legislation and education initiatives. :: Amber Rudd to ban acid sales to under-18s Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Kearton called for a new law to criminalise the carrying of corrosive substances to match knife laws. And she urged scientists to develop a street testing kit for police officers who find suspicious liquids during stop and search operations. ACC Kearton said: ""We are talking low numbers, compared with the annual 32,000 knife attacks, but it is a worrying increase and we need to understand the reasons why. ""I fear it's a crime that is under-reported, often by people in a domestic situation who are afraid of reprisals, or young gang members who are worried about a comeback if they speak to police."" She is leading a study of victims and attackers on behalf of the National Police Chiefs Council. (NPCC) The analysis will be published in the Spring and is expected to help shape new laws. Carrying acid and corrosive substances, many of which are sold on the high street and in routine use in homes, is currently not a crime, unless police can prove an intention to use it in a crime. Ms Kearton wants a new law to put the onus on the person carrying the substance to prove a legitimate use. She said there were around 20 substances, from sulphuric acid to household bleach, that had been used in attacks. Victims were largely men, aged 26 to 35, but evidence showed younger males were being targeted. Acid and corrosive substances were being used in domestic violence, hate crime and robbery, mostly in urban areas but increasingly in rural settings."

With fire across the entire top surface of the pillar, the flames appear to have grown to a height to such an extent they dwarf the remaining half of the candle. Warning others of the danger, Ms Ferneyhough wrote: ""This is a candle I bought in Primark Manchester for £5 on Saturday. I am concerned that it poses a risk to the safety of anyone who owns one, and I have emailed Primark suggesting they recall them. ""In the meantime, I would be grateful if we could spread the word so that no one is put at risk by this. #primark"". Her snaps of the white and silver Xmas candle bursting into flames soon went viral, with her post shared over 250,000 times. Ms Ferneyhough said that while the candle burned normally for a couple of hours, it then started to burn right across the top.

2017-12-08,Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker have set out the terms of their breakthrough deal after the first phase of Brexit negotiations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-key-points-of-breakthrough-deal-11161500,"Here are the key points from the ""joint report"" from EU and UK negotiators. :: LIVE: PM secures Brexit deal with £40bn fee:: PM's Brexit fudge recipe might yet leave bad taste :: Irish border The UK is committed to avoiding a ""hard border"" between Ireland and Northern Ireland ""including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls"", according to the document. In the absence of an overall trade deal, the UK will maintain ""full alignment"" with elements of the EU single market and customs union which support the economy of the island of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. In a move which appears to satisfy DUP concerns, ""no new regulatory barriers"" will be allowed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and Northern Ireland businesses will continue to have ""unfettered access"" to the UK internal market. But the fundamental question of how there can be an open border when Northern Ireland leaves the customs union remains unresolved. :: Financial settlement The document does not provide a figure for the UK's ""divorce bill"" but Mrs May insists the financial settlement will be ""fair to the British taxpayer"". The bill is expected to be £35bn-£39bn. The UK will continue contributing to the EU budget for the years 2019 and 2020 ""as if it had remained in the Union"". The financial settlement ""will be drawn up and paid in euro"" and the second phase of Brexit negotiations will address the schedule of payments. :: Citizens' rights Mrs May says the Brexit agreement will guarantee the rights of the three million EU citizens in the UK who can ""go on living their lives as before."" EU citizens living legally in the UK will be allowed to remain in the country in line with current freedom of movement principles. The deal also allows their family members who do not live in the UK, including spouses, parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren, to join them in future. The guarantees outlined in the document also apply to UK citizens living in EU countries. :: European Court of Justice The ECJ will continue to have a role in overseeing the rights of EU citizens in the UK for eight years after withdrawing - likely to spark concern among Brexit backers. According to the document, the UK must ""establish a mechanism enabling its courts and tribunals to ask the ECJ for interpretation of those rights"". It has been reported that the UK expects this to affect only a small number of cases a year, in circumstances when there is no case law. European Council President Donald Tusk has said the UK must respect EU law during a transition period of around two years after March 2019. This would include any new laws passed by the EU27 without British involvement."
2017-12-08,The Brexit-battered pound has failed to benefit from the UK's deal with the EU to secure trade talks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/pound-falls-despite-brexit-border-breakthrough-in-eu-talks-11161157,"Sterling fell half a cent against the greenback as the breakthrough was confirmed in Brussels, sinking from above $1.35 to $1.3465. Analysts said a strengthening of the US currency later determined further weakness, with the pound dropping to $1.34 on Friday afternoon as a strong set of US employment figures dominated sentiment. It also fell back against the euro after hitting six-month highs when European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared ""sufficient progress"" had been made in the first phase of Brexit talks to allow negotiations on future trade to begin later this month. :: LIVE: PM secures Brexit deal with £40bn fee It was the development that had been expected earlier in the week - only to be foiled because of wrangles over the Irish border - and it was broadly welcomed by the UK's business community as a positive step. However, lobby groups said it now piled pressure on ministers to provide clarity on the post-divorce relationship. Sterling's reaction helped boost the value of dollar-earning firms on the FTSE 100, which was 0.8% up in afternoon deals. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said: ""The response in the pound to the announcement may come as a surprise given just how significant today's agreement is but it's worth noting that this has been in the making over the last couple of weeks and it was in both sides' interest to get this done today. ""Had the two sides failed to come to an agreement then the downside in the pound may well have been far greater. ""We've seen a rally in the pound over the last couple of weeks on the expectation of a deal being agreed so what we may be seeing is simply a case of buying the rumour and selling the fact."" Sterling has been the big casualty, in value terms, since the UK voted to leave the EU in June last year. It had been trading at $1.50 ahead of the shock result - falling below $1.20 in the months that followed. Its weakness has been the core reason for the surge in inflation during 2017 as the cost of imported goods has risen and been passed on to businesses and consumers alike. Wage increases failing to keep pace has damaged household spending power and prompted concerns about consumer debt. For many businesses the cost pressures have been secondary to uncertainty over the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. The head of lobby group UK Finance told Sky News on Thursday how firms were nearing ""the point of no return"" in terms of firing the starting gun on their contingency plans - to avoid the possibility of a so-called cliff-edge Brexit. The progress was warmly welcomed though the CBI aimed a dig at the UK's approach, saying: ""Discussions will continue to be tough, but today's progress shows that careless talk of walking away can be replaced by confidence that the UK can get a good deal. ""Steely determination in the national interest must always come first."" The TUC called on the Government to drop ""self-defeating red lines"" in leaving the single market and customs union, suggesting it bring in union expertise to aid future talks. Stephen Martin, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said: ""Businesses will be breathing a huge sigh of relief that the UK and European Commission have reached agreement on phase 1 issues, putting us in a good position going into the Council meeting next week. ""It doesn't mean the hard work has all been done, far from it, but it does mean we are now very close to discussing transitional arrangements and our future trading relationship with the EU. ""The most pressing concern for UK companies has been their EU staff, who have urgently needed certainty about their future in this country. ""We have grounds to hope now that our members will be able to send their employees off for the Christmas break feeling more comfortable about their status here."" His counterpart at the British Chambers of Commerce, Dr Adam Marshall, said: ""Business will particularly cheer the mutual commitment to a transition period to support business confidence and trade, and will want the details confirmed swiftly in the new year when negotiators move on to the big questions around our future trade relationship with the EU."" He added: ""Businesses want answers on what leaving the EU will mean for regulation, customs, hiring, standards, tariffs and taxes.

The talks are aimed at drawing a line under months of talks between the Government's Insolvency Service and the former trustees following widespread criticism of their stewardship of the charity, which collapsed in 2015. Unless an agreement is reached by the pre-Christmas deadline, the Insolvency Service is expected to pursue formal disqualification proceedings against the trustees through the courts. Sources said on Friday that Camila Batmanghelidjh, Kids Company's controversial founder and chief executive, was not part of the negotiations relating to so-called voluntary undertakings and was likely to face an attempt to disqualify her from boardrooms. Ms Batmanghelidjh was not on the charity's board, but the Insolvency Service is understood to have been arguing that she ""acted as a de facto director"". Talks about the voluntary undertakings have been underway for at least two months, with former trustees asked to agree to varying periods during which they would not serve as a director of any company. The former Kids Company directors were told during the summer that they faced bans of between two-and-a-half and six years. Mr Yentob, who chaired the charity for 12 years, is thought to have been informed that the Insolvency Service was pursuing a six-year disqualification against him, but giving a voluntary undertaking would be expected to reduce that period to around five years. He stepped down from his BBC role four months after Kids Company's collapse, saying his continued service was ""proving a serious distraction"" to the Corporation.‎ He continued to be paid a six-figure sum last year by the BBC for presenting Imagine, an arts programme. Mr Yentob had been accused of editorial interference after criticising BBC journalists' coverage of Kids Company's financial problems. Filings at Companies House show that he is an active director of a company called I Am Curious…Productions. It was unclear whether all of Kids Company's former trustees remained in talks about offering undertakings. They are understood to be being advised by Bates Wells Braithwaite, a law firm. According to guidance published by the Insolvency Service, individuals who are subject to proceedings to ban them can either defend the case in court or offer a ""disqualification undertaking"". That voluntary route usually results in individuals agreeing to slightly shorter periods of 'disqualification'. It also avoids them having the ignominy of a formal ban against their names, even though the outcome is effectively identical. Kids Company's other trustees included Richard Handover, a former boss of WHSmith, Vince O'Brien, former chair of the British Venture Capital Association, and Jane Tyler, a former partner at the law firm Macfarlanes. Kids Company's collapse sparked a huge political controversy, because of the backing it had received from David Cameron, the then Prime Minister. Mr Cameron backed a £3m Government grant to the charity little more than a month before its demise, arguing that its work meant it was worth ""one more go"" to secure its future.‎ ‎ Ms Batmanghelidjh, who was awarded a CBE during Mr Cameron's premiership, ran the charity on a £90,000 annual salary and vehemently defended its governance even as it lurched towards bankruptcy. Kids Company claimed to support 36,000 children and young adults, working with those who were struggling with mental health issues after being involved in gun and gang crime, or who were suffering from neglect.‎ In total, it received £42m of public money over a 15-year period - although some media reports have put that figure at as much as £50m. It eventually closed its doors, though, after the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into allegations of abuse at the charity. A damning report by MPs in February 2016 outlined an ""extraordinary catalogue of failures"", with its board of trustees reliant on ""wishful thinking and false optimism"". Mr Yentob could not be reached for comment on Friday, while Bates Wells Braithwaite declined to comment. The Insolvency Service has not commented since a statement in July, in which it said: ""We can confirm that the Insolvency Service has written to the former directors of Keeping Kids Company informing them that the Business Secretary intends to bring proceedings to have them disqualified from running or controlling companies for periods of between two-and-a-half and six years.‎ ""As this matter will now be tested in the court it is not appropriate to comment further."""
2017-12-08,A YouTube prankster has been criticised after cementing his head in a microwave - costing a fire service £650 to free him.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/youtube-prankster-who-cemented-head-in-microwave-slammed-over-price-of-firefighter-rescue-11162064,"Jay Swingler put his head in a plastic bag inside the microwave before friends poured seven bags of Polyfilla inside, and he quickly became trapped. After 90 minutes of trying to free him, his friends called an ambulance crew to the address in Fordhouses, Wolverhampton on Thursday afternoon. Paramedics were unable to help and so West Midlands Fire Service was called, resulting in a rescue operation that tied up five firefighters for almost an hour and cost £650. Because the 22-year-old's life was in danger the fire service will have to foot the bill. Mr Swingler tweeted that he was ""very lucky to be alive"" and had been left ""traumatised"". However, many of his YouTube fans were not sympathetic, suggesting he should apologise and cover the cost of his rescue. One commented: ""You should count yourself lucky and think twice whether you're ever going to put your life at risk again. ""What frustrates me the most is that the time paramedics have spent with you may had affected someone's else survival."" Another said: ""Do the right thing and give (West Midlands Fire Service) the money"". Mr Swingler has hit back at claims he wasted the emergency services' time and diverted crews away from other incidents. In a video posted on Friday, he said he was ""in need and would have died without (firefighters)"", adding he should be fined for the stunt. He said: ""I'm more than happy to donate my money to the people who helped me that day. ""I should be fined just like the people who get into drunken fights and use the emergency services' time."" West Midlands Fire Service said it was ""seriously unimpressed"" with the stunt. Station commander Simon Woodward added: ""We pride ourselves on our five-minute attendance standard. ""That means that if we have an incident where there is life at risk, our appliances will be there within five minutes and that gives us our best chance to save that life. ""If we're attending incidents that are YouTube videos where we have people who've been irresponsible, those crews are unable to attend those life-risk incidents. ""The service charge for that would be £650. We are not going to charge because his life was in danger. What I would like to do is to remind everybody not to put their lives at risk for the sake of other people's entertainment."""
2017-12-08,The Prime Minister has secured a deal with the EU to push Brexit negotiations to their next phase following an all-night diplomatic scramble.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-secures-brexit-deal-with-eu-after-all-night-talks-11161333,"In an early morning news conference in Brussels - after sharing breakfast with Theresa May - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared ""sufficient progress"" had now been achieved on initial divorce matters. Hailing the agreement as the product of ""compromise"" from all sides, the EU boss paved the way for Brexit talks to now advance onto details of a transition period and the final post-Brexit EU-UK relationship. Mr Juncker expressed confidence leaders of the 27 other EU member states would accept the agreement and therefore move to the second phase of negotiations at a Brussels summit next week. The Prime Minister described the deal as ""a hard-won agreement in all our interests"". Standing alongside Mr Juncker at the news conference, Mrs May told reporters the agreement would guarantee the rights of three million EU citizens living in the UK. These would be ""enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts"", the Prime Minister said. She added the so-called Brexit bill, which could be as much as £50bn, would be ""fair to the British taxpayer"" and also insisted the agreement offered a guarantee there would be ""no hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Moving on to the second phase of Brexit talks, which will include discussions on a transition period, will be welcomed by businesses. They have warned the Prime Minister a lack of clarity about such a period before the end of the year might lead to them taking decisions that would see investment and jobs moving out of the UK. There was no immediate backlash from Conservative Brexiteers on the terms of the deal. Environment Secretary and Vote Leave architect Michael Gove said: ""This is a significant achievement because it means the rights of EU citizens are protected in the UK, the rights of UK citizens are protected in the EU. ""We have an agreement that no EU country will be out of pocket as a result of our departure. ""But there will be more money for the NHS and for schools and for housing in this country as a result of our leaving the EU. ""And also we can now get on to talking about that free-trade deal. ""It's a significant step forward and it's one I think the overwhelming majority of people in Parliament and in the country will welcome."" His fellow Cabinet Brexiteer and Vote Leave figurehead, Boris Johnson, praised Mrs May's ""determination in getting today's deal"". But, in an apparent warning to the Prime Minister, he insisted a future trade deal must remain ""true to the referendum result"" by ""taking back control of our laws, money and borders for the whole of the UK"". The deal was also welcomed by prominent Remain supporters on the Tory benches. In a late night tweet, the Government's Chief Whip, Julian Smith, made a pledge to Conservative MPs that he would ensure their opinions were listened to during the next phase of negotiations. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the deal would allow Mrs May to move on to ""the next stage of humiliation"" in Brexit talks. A deal in Brussels is good news for Mrs May as we can now move on to the next stage of humiliation. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, cautiously welcomed the agreement as ""encouraging"" but urged the Prime Minister to adopt a different approach to Brexit. He said: ""As the talks now move on to a discussion about Britain's future relationship with the EU, Theresa May must seriously reflect on her approach to the negotiations so far. ""We cannot have another year of chaos and confusion or the farcical scenes we saw earlier on in the week that put jobs and the economy at risk."" The Prime Minister and Brexit Secretary David Davis arrived in Brussels shortly before 6am on Friday, where they held a breakfast meeting with Mr Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. It followed an agreement being reached by Mrs May with Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, who had rejected an initial draft agreement the Prime Minister had hoped to seal on Monday. Mrs Foster told Sky News ""substantial changes"" to the text had been made to ensure Northern Ireland would leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK."
2017-12-08,"Brexit could cause chaos at Britain's borders, with not enough parking spaces for lorries awaiting customs checks and problems with IT systems, according to MPs.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-could-spark-uk-borders-chaos-mps-warn-11161038,"Parliament's spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), claims borders could be exposed to risks immediately after Brexit because of a lack of planning. The MPs claim border checks on people entering the UK could treble after the UK leaves the EU and checks on lorries could quadruple, yet Government planning is ""not fit for purpose"". And they say it is ""extremely worrying"" that Government departments expect little change at UK borders after withdrawal in March 2019, even if no exit deal is agreed with the EU. ""We are very concerned that their assumptions are risky and do not allow for changes in behaviours by companies trading across the border, or people crossing it,"" says the committee in a highly critical report. ""Particularly in the event of a no-deal scenario, the border could be exposed to risks on day one of the UK's departure. ""Officials are relying too much on there being a transitional period in order to have the time to develop the new systems and infrastructure that may be required. ""The current negotiations bring significant uncertainty, but the new Border Planning Group and Government departments need to step up and be prepared for the possibility of a no-deal scenario and for the costs of all potential options."" The committee is worried that the Government's Border Planning Group does not expect to have any extra border infrastructure, such as additional parking bays at ports for lorries, in place by Brexit day in March 2019. Another concern is that not all new and updated IT systems required as a result of Brexit will be up and running by the withdrawal date either. ""Government departments' poor track record of delivering critical border programmes, such as e-borders, leaves us sceptical that they are up to the challenges of planning for the border post-Brexit, including having enough people to manage it,"" says the committee in its report. Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, hit out at the Government's approach, stating: ""Against the hard deadline of Brexit it is borderline reckless - an over-reliance on wishful thinking that risks immediately exposing the UK to an array of damaging scenarios. ""Last month, we reported on the threat of chaos if HMRC's new customs system is not ready in time for Brexit and there is no viable fall-back option. ""We were deeply concerned by the lack of progress on this back-up plan. It is now alarming to note such weak contingency planning extends across Government departments. ""The volume of traffic at the border under current arrangements is substantial: in 2016, around 300 million people and 500 million tons of freight crossed it. ""After Brexit, the number of decisions required about people or goods crossing could more than treble and more than quadruple respectively. ""These figures should concern all in Government and in our view its current approach is not fit for purpose."""

Senior Whitehall sources have hailed the deal clinched over breakfast in Brussels as a win for Theresa May, after officials rated the chances of a deal at only 50-50 on Thursday evening.

During the marathon negotiations on Thursday night, DUP leader Arlene Foster spoke to the PM on the phone twice - first at 9pm and then again at 11pm - and was won round in the second phone call. A senior Whitehall source said: ""They needed lots of hand-holding and assurances that we wouldn't sell them out by putting the border in the Irish Sea."" :: Analysis - PM's Brexit fudge recipe might yet leave bad taste The PM then managed to get a couple of hours sleep at home in the village of Sonning in her Maidenhead constituency, before she was picked up at 3.45am for an RAF flight to Brussels. In a third victory for the UK, the EU had wanted Britain's courts to accept a voluntary role for the European Court of Justice for 15 years. ""We got them down to eight,"" a source told Sky News."
2017-12-08,The Pope has revealed he wants to change the Lord's Prayer - as he thinks the current version implies that God pushes people toward sin.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171209011733/https://news.sky.com/story/pope-francis-wants-to-change-the-lords-prayer-11161315,"He said the line ""lead us not into temptation"", memorised by hundreds of millions of Christians for centuries, is based on a flawed translation. ""It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation,"" the Pope said. The implication is awkward for Christians, who believe it is Satan who tempts people to sin. ""I am the one who falls. It's not him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen,"" the Pope explained. ""A father doesn't do that, a father helps you to get up immediately. It's Satan who leads us into temptation, that's his department."" The Pope's comments, made in an interview with Italian television, could lead to a change in the prayer, which is taken from the Bible and is considered by some to encapsulate the core messages of Christianity. It also weighs in on a long-running liturgical debate over the nature of evil and the relationship between religion and language, explained Church of England theologian Reverend Dr Ian Paul. The current version has been used by the Catholic Church since 1966, when the Second Vatican Council decided modern vernacular should be used in services instead of Latin. Before being translated from the Latin vulgate it was translated from ancient Greek. The original text was written in Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus. Part of the uncertainty behind the line comes from the original Greek of the central word: peirasmos, which means temptation but can also be used in a more general sense to mean testing. ""The line has a broader sense - that we're asking God to protect us from really difficult testing,"" Rev Dr Paul said. Some theologians argue that alternatives to the current line might suggest God is powerless to stop temptation by the devil. ""What the prayer does now is puts everything under the power and control of God,"" Rev Dr Paul said. Pope Francis' remarks follow a decision on the subject by the French Catholic Church, which voted last month to change to a translation approximating ""do not let us enter into temptation"". The Church of Latter-Day Saints, also known as the Mormons, uses the adapted line ""suffer us not to be led into temptation"". Any changes to the widespread use of the prayer in the Catholic Church would only be decided after extensive consultation, however. Rev Dr Paul said the Church of England had no plans to change the Lord's Prayer. ""In the end you can't actually control how people interpret stuff just by translating, we have to talk about it and explain it too,"" he said."

He was also found guilty of possessing an AK-47 assault rifle and receiving £2,000 to fund terrorism. :: The IS Files: Unmasking Britain's terrorists Abdallah travelled to Syria with three friends in July 2014 and his wheelchair-bound brother Abdalraouf, 24, stayed in the UK and directed them from the family home in Moss Side, south Manchester, after being shot and paralysed while fighting in the conflict. He spent two years fighting for the terror group in the Middle East before returning to the UK in September 2016 and being arrested at Heathrow Airport. The Old Bailey heard that Abdallah was known to the authorities after Sky News obtained thousands of documents containing names, addresses and contact details of registered IS fighters. The file showed that the former supermarket worker was listed as a ""fighter"" and specialised as a ""sniper"". Abdallah was good friends with Manchester bomber Salman Abedi and they lived just streets away. They visited the Al-Rahman Islamic Centre in Moss Side together and members told Sky News they were ""horrified and sickened"" by how their former members turned out. In mitigation, Rajiv Menon QC said there was no evidence Abdallah was ""on a mission"" in the two years between leaving Syria after four weeks and the time his involvement with IS emerged, but he has been put behind bars for 10 years with five years on extended licence."
2017-12-09,"Kenny Alexander, the chief executive of gaming firm GVC Holdings, is known to like a flutter.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171210014852/https://news.sky.com/story/the-gambler-driving-gvcs-bid-for-ladbrokes-coral-11160038,"He proved it again today when the company he heads - which owns brands including Foxy Bingo, Sportingbet, CasinoClub, Cashcade and Party Poker - tabled a bid for Ladbrokes Coral. Scotsman Mr Alexander has already tried twice during the last year to snare Ladbrokes Coral. He is clearly hoping that this will be a case of third time lucky. What is unusual about the timing of today's announcement is that, while GVC had always been expected to have another tilt at Ladbrokes, the assumption was that it would wait until the Government had completed its review of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) - the lucrative but highly controversial gaming machines that sit in every high street bookmaker. :: Ladbrokes Coral in talks on takeover by GVC The review is likely to impose a lower maximum stake per spin on the machines which, depending on how low the figure is, is likely to take a chunk out of the profits of bookmakers. Accordingly, GVC could have been forgiven for waiting a while to see what the Department for Culture, Media and Sport came up with, not least because confusion over the issue has clouded previous negotiations over how to value Ladbrokes. GVC's solution has been to come up with a clever formula under which the eventual sum it pays will depend on the outcome of the review and values Ladbrokes at anywhere between £3.1bn and £3.9bn. The combined business is expected to be worth some £5.7bn and would qualify for membership of the FTSE 100. Yet only as recently as September, Mr Alexander - who has taken GVC from being an Aim-listed minnow to a £2.75bn member of the FTSE 250 in a decade - was insisting he would ""definitely...not be doing anything before the outcome of the review"". What will startle casual observers is the way in which GVC, a 13-year old business few outside the City will have heard of, is in a position to snaffle an established company boasting two of the best-known names in the industry. Joe Coral, after all, launched his bookmaking business 91 years ago while Ladbrokes dates back even further, to 1886. That reflects dramatic changes in the gaming industry, in particular the explosive growth of online betting, but also the rapid growth of GVC itself via a series of mergers and acquisitions. Founded in 2004, as Luxembourg-based Gaming VC Holdings, its meteoric growth began when, in March 2007, Kilmarnock-supporting Mr Alexander - who will head the combined GVC and Ladbrokes - became chief executive. After a string of smaller deals, the first big one came when, in 2013, GVC teamed up with William Hill to buy the online sports betting business Sportingbet. Then, in 2015, it outbid rival 888 Holdings to pay £1.1bn for Bwin.Party, a fallen star of the gaming sector formed from the merger of the former Real Madrid shirt sponsor Bwin and the former FTSE 100 member PartyGaming. This was the boldest roll of the dice yet for Mr Alexander as, at the time, Bwin.Party was more than twice the size of GVC. Again, as with Sportingbet, he and his colleagues proved adept at successfully integrating another business. But Ladbrokes Coral, even at the lower end of the price range being mooted, is a much bigger beast than anything GVC has previously taken on and, like Bwin.Party, it is larger than GVC itself. Moreover, unlike Sportingbet and Bwin.Party, it is not a purely digital business but one boasting physical assets in the form of 3,700 high street betting shops. Mr Alexander has, in the recent past, made clear his preference for acquiring online gaming businesses ahead of ones owning bookmaking shops because the former tend to be more highly valued by investors than the latter. By contrast, he was today talking about how the ""enlarged group would be an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business that would benefit from a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy"". Aside from Mr Alexander's apparent conversion to the joys of high street betting shops, this deal raises several questions. One is whether this deal fires the starting pistol on another round of consolidation in the betting industry. Betfair has already joined forces with Paddy Power but the likes of 888 Holdings, William Hill, Jackpotjoy and Canadian firm Stars Group, owner of the PokerStars website, are all expected to participate in further tie-ups. So too could Mecca bingo and Grosvenor casino operator Rank and SkyBet, in which Sky plc, the parent of Sky News, has a minority shareholding. At least as intriguing is how Bet365 - along with GVC and Paddy Power Betfair, one of the three biggest global players in online sports betting - reacts to all this. And the biggest question of all is whether the DCMS could yet disrupt the industrial logic of this deal by confounding everyone with its review of FOBTs."

When asked about the condition of the person, she said they were ""stable"". The incident comes after the songwriter suffered a stroke last year. Darren Fewins, who had been watching the show with his wife, said the 66-year-old had been performing his set for 40 to 45 minutes before falling backwards. He said: ""He was standing by the microphone and he had the guitar in his hand and he kept shaking his left hand as if there was something not quite right with it. ""He walked forward to the microphone and he was trying to grab the microphone with his left hand, and it was swinging from side-to-side. ""I thought at first there was something wrong with it and he was trying to keep it steady. He then took three or four steps backwards. ""Then he just collapsed on the stage backwards.

Mr Fewins said the singer ""looked brilliant"" before the dramatic end to the gig and said he had been getting the crowd to clap along to the music. ""He looked fit, he looked well. He was changing guitars every song, and he just looked like someone who I have seen several times and was playing the best I have ever seen,"" the music fan said.

He was led into a house on Monday afternoon by two men who demanded to know if his gold Rolex watch, worth £9,000, was real. A gang of armed men were waiting inside the property in Thornton Heath and subjected the victim to an ""extended bout of physical abuse and humiliation"" over more than two days, Scotland Yard said. He was kicked in the face and threatened with knives and a gun before being forced to phone his parents to get them to pay a ""significant sum"" of money to his kidnappers. After his parents said they could not pay the ransom demand, the victim was made to hand over the keys to his family's home so two of the gang could burgle the property. CCTV images show two suspects enter the house in Sydenham, south east London, where a large sum of cash, designer handbags, designer sunglasses and Rolex watches were taken, police said. The victim managed to escape his kidnappers when he was driven to the Metro bank in North End, Croydon, to withdraw money. He fled to a nearby church, Croydon Minster, and police were called. The Metropolitan Police have named two brothers, Ali Dervish, 28, and 19-year-old Sinan Dervish, who are wanted in connection with the kidnapping. Two other men, aged 39 and 58, were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping on Friday and have been bailed to a date in January.

2017-12-09,"Boris Johnson ""spoke frankly"" with his Iranian counterpart during a two-hour meeting in Tehran, the Foreign Office has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171210014852/https://news.sky.com/story/johnson-in-two-hours-of-frank-talks-with-iran-11163721,"During what his department described as ""two hours of frank talks"", the UK's Foreign Secretary expressed his ""grave concerns"" over jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Mr Johnson is also expected to meet Iranian president Hassan Rouhani on Sunday. He began Saturday's talks by expressing his condolences for a powerful earthquake which killed more than 400 people in November. Speaking to the Iranian foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif, Mr Johnson also expressed the UK's continued support for the nuclear deal. Donald Trump has previously criticised the deal as ""one of the worst and most one-sided"" agreements the US has ever signed, and was in turn criticised for moving against it. Sky's Diplomatic Editor, Dominic Waghorn, noted that the Iranian foreign ministry issued a short statement saying that the two sides discussed ""various matters including economic, banking and trade relations"". ""It was quite a long meeting, and it was followed by a meeting with the speaker of the Parliament and other Iranian officials,"" Waghorn said. ""It was a pre-planned visit, so there were lots of issues that were being discussed, but obviously very close to Boris Johnson's heart - and important to his career - is the plight of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, after the mistake he made in front of MPs."" According to the Foreign Office, Mr Johnson and Mr Zarif ""spoke frankly about the obstacles in the relationship"" between the two nations. :: Richard Ratcliffe: My fight to free Nazanin from jail in Iran It is the first trip of a British Foreign Secretary to Iran since 2015 and only the third since 2003, and comes as Mr Johnson continues a three-day tour of Oman, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. The Foreign Office said the pair discussed ""the consular cases of British-Iranian dual nationals"" although the department did not name Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe specifically. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence for allegedly planning to overthrow the Iranian government - a claim she and her family have always denied. She was arrested in April 2016 at Tehran airport after visiting her relatives with her daughter. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has always stressed that the trip was a holiday, but she was jailed for sedition after authorities linked her to mass protests in 2009. Dominic Waghorn noted that the Foreign Secretary was meeting those on the moderate side of the Iranian government - but in the background you have the hardliners, who may want to keep dual nationals in prison because it deters other foreigners from going to the country pursuing their own interests. ""Tomorrow, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is back in court for a scheduled hearing where she may have her sentenced increased. If she does, that will be embarrassing for the Foreign Secretary to have gone there without securing any progress - in fact the reverse, if that happens - and of course it will be devastating for her family."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard told Sky News it was encouraging that Mr Johnson had constructive and frank discussions and good news that he was meeting the president. He said: ""I'm really pleased that he met with foreign minister Zarif, that it lasted for a couple of hours and that it was both frank and constructive. I think in our case a frank discussion and a constructive one can only be a good thing."" :: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: A timeline He said Mr Johnson also met others who might be able to help with her case. ""I was hoping to go on this trip... and he said he would check if the Iranian authorities thought it was a good idea. In short he felt that I could have gone for a couple of days but it would be more helpful and more likely for her to come home if he went on his own and was able to press that case amongst a range of issues."" The Foreign Office said: ""Overall, it was a useful meeting at the start of the Foreign Secretary's visit to Iran. ""The Foreign Secretary subsequently met the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Mr Ali Larijani, and the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Mr Ali Shamkhani,"" the department added. The Government is considering repaying around £400m from a pre-1979 arms deal, but both sides say it is not to do with Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe. However, the US made a similar payment as Iran released four of its citizens in 2016."

""Digital currency might be easier to gain than physical currency. So I think it's reasonable."" Bitcoin's value has risen dramatically over the course of 2017, but especially during the past week, peaking at one Bitcoin being worth $16,000 (£11,940). The currency's value is up 1,500% this year, driven by sheer speculation. Ms Shen and her colleagues have tracked attacks by hacking groups Lazarus, Bluenoroff and Andariel - suspected to be North Korean operations - on financial institutions including banks in Europe and South Korea, an ATM company and Bitcoin exchange. She told Sky News: ""Before, when we tracked nation-state attackers, they usually perform cyberattacks which are aimed for confidential data and intelligence. ""However recently we've discovered that some of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups are trying to hack financial institutions like banks and Bitcoin exchanges to gain financial profit."" Ms Shen said the attacks had so far been unsuccessful. ""My own opinion is they will probably keep doing the Bitcoins because the price keeps increasing and it's a good investment... So I assume they will do more Bitcoin attacks and of course they will keep targeting banks because that's what they did before."" :: Bitcoin crackdown as UK mulls cryptocurrency regulation One of her co-researchers, who wishes to remain anonymous because they work for a South Korean bank, told Sky News: ""Just a few years ago the attacks were initiated to paralyze the society, but for sometime now they've been hacking for money - so I kind of wonder if they are facing financial difficulties.""

2017-12-09,"Senior members of Theresa May's government have backed her breakthrough deal in the Brexit talks, which includes paying more than £30bn to Brussels.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171210014852/https://news.sky.com/story/cabinet-heavyweights-back-pms-brexit-breakthrough-deal-11161938,"The agreement on the size of the so-called ""divorce bill"", along with guarantees on citizens' rights and the status of the Irish border after Brexit, came after a night of frantic diplomacy. Negotiators said it delivered the required ""sufficient progress"" to move on to the next phase of talks - but these are likely to be even tougher. :: Key points of the deal:: Analysis: Brexit fudge recipe might yet leave bad taste European Council President Donald Tusk warned the most difficult challenge is still ahead, adding: ""So much time has been devoted to the easiest part of the task. Now, to negotiate a transition arrangement and the framework for our future relationship we have de facto less than a year."" British Prime Minister Theresa May hailed the deal as a ""hard-won agreement in all our interests"" - and senior members of her top team have publicly backed her. While criticism among Leave-supporting MPs has been muted so far, there have been hints of some discontent. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal is the result of compromise and he is recommending EU leaders approve moving onto the next phase, which will cover the future trading relationship and the terms of the transition, at a summit next week. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted his congratulations to the PM, praising her ""determination in getting today's deal"". Congratulations to PM for her determination in getting today's deal. We now aim to forge a deep and special partnership with our European friends and allies while remaining true to the referendum result - taking back control of our laws, money and borders for the whole of the UK. Mr Johnson - a Vote Leave figurehead in the referendum campaign - had previously said the EU could ""go whistle"" if it asked for a hefty sum from Britain. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who like Mr Johnson campaigned for Leave, described it as a ""significant personal political achievement"" which will mean there is more money for the NHS. Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd also welcomed the news: Delighted a deal agreed in Brussels that paves way for further progress on talks about future UK/EU relationship. A positive step. Congratulations @theresa_may 1/2 Delighted we've reached an agreement which will give both Europeans here in the UK and British citizens in the EU binding guarantees about their residence rights. 2/2 I hope this will now give those concerned real peace of mind. We are building a new system so that the application process will be smooth and simple. For now, EU citizens in the UK, do not need to do anything. The breakthrough came after Mrs May and Brexit Secretary David Davis flew to Brussels to finalise the details of a joint document setting out proposals for the key divorce issues. Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, who blocked a previous agreement on Monday, was brought onside in the early hours of Friday. She said there had been ""substantial changes"" to the text which mean there will be ""no red line down the Irish Sea"" and no ""special status"" for Northern Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said it was a ""significant day"" for Ireland, with Dublin achieving ""all that we set out to achieve in phase one of these negotiations"". The size of the Brexit bill is significantly lower than was suggested, at an estimated £35bn-£39bn (€40-45bn). It will be paid over several years and the exact figure will not be known for some time. Sources told Sky News that the EU was seeking €60bn to €75bn euros (£53bn-£66bn). But while the breakthrough represents a victory for the PM, elements of the deal have caused disquiet. A particular source of comment is a passage that covers what happens on the island of Ireland in the event no trade deal is agreed. It says that the UK will keep ""full alignment"" with elements of the EU's single market and customs union which support the economy of the island of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement - something proponents of a clean break from Brussels are unlikely to be happy with. Former Brexit minister David Jones has warned this could hinder Britain's ability to sign free-trade deals with other nations. The European Court of Justice will continue to have a role overseeing EU citizens' rights in the UK for eight years after Brexit, something many Brexiteers view as anathema to ""taking back control"". Downing Street said only two or three cases a year are expected to be referred to the ECJ for ""interpretation"", adding that the court would not have the power to call in cases. The ""divorce bill"" has long been a source of controversy, with some arguing Britain should not be handing over such a large sum of money. Mrs May said the settlement would be ""fair to the British taxpayer"", but one senior Tory MP - speaking on condition of anonymity - told Sky News there would be ""incredible concern"" from the public. They added: ""It does make it much more difficult to make the case that we haven't got any money for public spending priorities at home."" On the ""full alignment"" issue, Mr Johnson appeared to try to placate potential concerns from the Conservative ranks. In response to a tweet from chief whip Julian Smith, which included a picture of him meeting Mrs May on Thursday, the Foreign Secretary said: Yes, great meeting with PM @theresa_may - found her totally determined that 'full alignment' means compatibility with taking back control of our money, laws and borders. Tory MPs Owen Paterson and John Redwood used Twitter to express their concerns: Big improvement on Monday text @EU_Commission has moved a long way. Still problematic areas inc Clause 49 (full alignment), role of ECJ & money. At last we are moving to free trade discussions. Problem areas must be debated & resolved. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed We need to remember that leaving on the WTO option means no add'l payments to the EU, whilst taking back control of our borders, our laws & our money. A good deal has to be better than this, otherwise the Government’s mantra that No Deal is better than a bad deal should apply. UKIP leader Nigel Farage was scathing, describing the deal as a ""capitulation"": The 17.4m did not vote for a large exit fee, the ECJ continuing to have a say over our country or a 2 year transition. This is not a deal, it's a capitulation. pic.twitter.com/cX9qrCi9iP Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal ""could have been done some time ago"" and called for more detail from Mrs May on the transition and ""what regulatory framework there will be in the future"". This echoes earlier comments from Mr Tusk, who asked for ""more clarity"" from Britain on what the future trading relationship will look like. ""While being satisfied with today's agreement, which is obviously a personal success for Prime Minister Theresa May, let us remember that the most difficult challenge is still ahead,"" he said. Under Mr Tusk's proposals, there will be a transition of around two years after March 2019. The UK will be required to respect EU law - including any legislation passed without Britain's involvement - observe budgetary commitments and the oversight of the ECJ."
2017-12-09,"The Prime Minister will be delighted to have negotiated the Brexit process to this point of ""sufficient progress"" on initial divorce matters.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171210014852/https://news.sky.com/story/pms-brexit-fudge-recipe-might-yet-leave-bad-taste-11161422,"But the progress, as well as being delayed by a couple of months, is not as far as she would have wanted. Immediate discussions will begin on a transition period, before talks about trade, which will still take some time to prepare internally by the 27 other EU member states. On Northern Ireland, the important point is Mrs May and her diplomats managed, in the early hours of Friday, to square off both Dublin and Belfast on the thorny issue of the Irish border. The change in words within Friday's agreed text were more about providing clarity rather than a fundamental change in the meaning of what had already been agreed on Monday. Instead of ""full regulatory alignment"", the new wording is ""full alignment with the rules"" of the EU's single market and customs union, which underpin the Good Friday Agreement and an open border. The recipe of the fudge has changed only a little, but sufficiently enough for the DUP to claim to have won ""six substantive changes"" to the wording. The key point is the position on Monday had left until the second phase of Brexit negotiations the precise degree of ""alignment"" required to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Dublin and Brussels believes this will be widespread, touching upon dozens of areas, but Belfast thinks it is just two or three. Over the past week the UK was quite literally negotiating with itself amid talks in Whitehall between the UK Government and Northern Ireland's DUP. The other substantive point of compromise in Friday's agreement is the length of a referral period for the European Court of Justice to enforce the rights of EU citizens. Both sides have compromised here. The EU asked for 15 years' of jurisdiction, the UK for five years. They have opted for eight years. It seems this is acceptable for Tory Brexiteers, but that is not what they were saying only a few months ago. This speaks to a wider truth. The real story of Brexit's first phase is how the Prime Minister has managed to get her own MPs to wear a series of compromises: on transition, sequencing, financial settlement, rights and potentially Ireland, too. Brexiteer MPs have shown that when push comes to shove, any Brexit is better than the risk of a Government collapse meaning no Brexit. Effectively, phase two negotiations are now for agreeing a transition period while phase three is for trade talks. A transition period will see Britain remain in the customs union and single market for two years. European Council President Donald Tusk revealed the UK has asked for this, but also warned it will mean Britain is obliged to accept new EU laws during the period. In practice, this will not change a great deal over the two years, but had previously been ruled out by Brexiteers. We are still some months from talking about trade, and years from actual trade talks. The really difficult stuff is now deciding the Brexit end state. Should it be high alignment and high access to the EU, such as a Norway-style deal? Or will it be low alignment and low access, such as a Canada-style trade deal? The question is whether the fall-back position for the Irish border of ""full alignment"" with the EU pre-configures that shape in some way. Logically one would presume so. If there's no deal, then we get full alignment. The idea that a deal would then see low alignment seems unlikely. But ministerial sources are adamant this is a red herring. They say Britain will enjoy full regulatory independence, there will be outcome equivalence but autonomy on reaching those outcomes, and the terms of Friday's deal on the Irish border are just a contingency. Longstanding Brexiteers would have preferred the word ""equivalence"" in Friday's agreement, and some trust has been lost by the fact this was not cleared in advance by the Cabinet sub-committee. They are still concerned and this will now be thrashed out in Cabinet as early as next week. The big winners here are the business community, who forced Number 10 to do whatever it takes to achieve a quickly agreed transition deal. That is why quick compromises were made by Mrs May. The second phase of negotiations will be even harder. A fudge only goes so far. It is an achievement for the Prime Minister to have got here. It is a significant achievement to have got the Cabinet and the DUP to sign up to this. But the real victory would be to get all her MPs on side. It is unclear if that is the case."
2017-12-09,"Folic acid should become a compulsory ingredient in flour as women of childbearing age are deficient in the essential nutrient, the Scottish and Welsh governments have said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171210014852/https://news.sky.com/story/demand-for-folic-acid-to-be-added-to-british-flour-to-help-childbearing-age-women-11162874,"Senior officials in the two countries have written a joint letter to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt after figures showed about four out of five women of childbearing age in Scotland and Wales need more folic acid, also known as vitamin B9. Food Standards Scotland (FSS) found there is strong evidence that flour fortification could help prevent birth defects, including spina bifida and other neural tube defects. Between 2008 and 2011 158 babies in Scotland were born with such conditions. A total of 131 pregnancies over the same period were terminated after the defects were detected. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) also backed the call to add folic acid to flour. Scottish Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell asked FSS to see if Scotland could proceed with the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid without Westminster's approval. However, for cost and practical reasons the body recommended that it be introduced across the entire UK. Under UK law, calcium carbonate, iron, thiamine (vitamin B1) and nicotinic acid, or nicotinamide, must be added to all flour produced in the UK unless the miller can prove the level present in wholemeal flour already meets the minimum level required. The NHS says adults need 200 micrograms of folic acid a day and if pregnant or trying for a baby women need 400mcg to prevent birth defects. :: 'Breakthrough' as scientists discover vitamin can cut birth defects and miscarriages Ms Campbell and Welsh Health Secretary Vaughan Gething told Mr Hunt 81% of women in Scotland of childbearing age and 79% in Wales were not getting the recommended amount of folic acid. Across the entire UK 75% of women are not getting enough of the nutrient, which cannot be stored in the body. The letter said: ""We are therefore clear that there remains a compelling case for action across the UK to reduce NTD incidence, particularly in the most socio-economically deprived areas."" They added reports by FSS and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) provided ""evidence for taking this forward on a UK-wide basis"". They said that view is backed by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. Ms Campbell and Mr Gething told Mr Hunt: ""We want to work together to make this happen. ""We strongly urge you and your ministerial colleagues to reconsider your position and press ahead quickly with a decision on mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid for England, and to agree to a uniform approach to the introduction of legislation across the UK."" A British Pregnancy Advisory Service spokeswoman said: ""We strongly support the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects in the UK, which often result in the termination of a much-wanted pregnancy. ""BPAS urges Mr Hunt to listen to the calls of his colleagues in Scotland and Wales and back this measure - there are very few public health interventions which have such a strong evidence base as this one."" A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We are grateful to SACN for their recent review of the evidence on folic acid. ""We will carefully consider their conclusions and respond in due course."""
2017-12-09,Health watchdogs have handed Britain's biggest care-home operator a 48-hour deadline to resolve a £26m interest payment that has become a focal point for doubts about the company's future.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171210014852/https://news.sky.com/story/health-watchdog-gives-four-seasons-48-hours-to-fix-debt-crisis-11162957,"Sky News has learnt that the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has told Four Seasons Healthcare Group and its biggest creditor, the investment firm H/2 Capital Partners, to come to an agreement over the debt repayment by Monday evening. The regulator, which can recommend to local authorities that they cease placing residents in homes, has told H/2 that it wants a formal guarantee that it will stand behind the company if a so-called standstill deal has not been reached by then. That assurance is already understood to have been provided by H/2, which has lined up the cross-bench peer Baroness Ford - who previously chaired Barchester, another care-homes group - as Four Seasons' chairman. Sources said this weekend that negotiations between Four Seasons, which operates nearly 350 homes, and H/2 were progressing well and that an announcement in relation to the £26m interest payment was likely to be made on Monday. The care-home operator is responsible for 17,000 predominantly elderly residents and employs just over 25,000 people - meaning it occupies an important role in Britain's adult social-care provision. Like other operators in the sector, Four Seasons has seen its financial performance suffer amid cuts in local authority funding and rising costs such as the national living wage. Terra Firma Capital Partners, the buyout firm which bought Four Seasons for £825m in 2012, has been trying to hand the keys to the company to H/2 but is unwilling to relinquish its claim over 24 homes which are held within an entity called Brighterkind. H/2 has already offered to let Four Seasons miss the next debt repayment, which is due on Thursday, but relations between them have become severely strained in recent weeks. Sources said this weekend that negotiations were now being held largely between the CQC, which is being advised by the law firm DLA Piper, Four Seasons and H/2. It was unclear whether Terra Firma's consent was required to activate the standstill agreement. The prospect of the UK's biggest care-homes group falling into administration just weeks before Christmas had begun to emerge amid the stalled talks between Terra Firma and H/2. Sky News understands that EY, the accountancy firm, has been put on standby to handle an administration if the crisis at Four Seasons deteriorates further. Were that to happen, it would be the industry's biggest financial failure since the collapse of Southern Cross in 2011. However, a formal forbearance deal will reduce the risk of such an event, since it will give H/2 time to pursue a so-called consent solicitation exercise, canvassing support from Four Seasons' other bondholders. A 30-day cure period will also prevent any other creditors pushing the company into administration. Terra Firma, which has lost an estimated £450m on its investment in Four Seasons, and H/2 are still understood to be at loggerheads over the appointment of a restructuring committee and independent directors to the board of the company. The CQC has been monitoring the crisis at Four Seasons for months, and is understood to have decided to give the company and its biggest creditor a deadline several days ahead of the debt repayment date Andrea Sutcliffe, the regulator's chief inspector of adult social care, said: ""Through our Market Oversight function, CQC has a responsibility to advise local authorities if we believe that services are likely to be disrupted as a result of business failure. ""We continue to closely monitor developments of what is a dynamic situation. ""I would like to confirm at this point in time we do not believe that services are likely to be disrupted as a result of business failure."" A spokesman for Four Seasons said on Saturday that it was ""making constructive progress towards restructuring the business under new ownership"". A senior source close to H/2 Capital said it was ""doing everything it can to deliver a positive outcome to discussions that will ensure that the welfare of the 17,000 residents will not be jeopardised in any way"". Terra Firma said it had ""urged all parties to agree a consensual restructuring of Four Seasons""."
2017-12-09,"British-Pakistani researchers have found that 84% of all people convicted since 2005 for the specific crime of gang grooming were Asian.

According to the most recent figures, released in 2012 by the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command (CEOP), 100% of child sex offenders in paedophile rings were white. The report says CEOP, an official government body, identifies two types of group-based child sexual exploitation offenders. Type 1 offenders were those that targeted their victims based on their vulnerability (roughly equivalent of grooming gangs), whereas Type 2 offenders target children as a result of a specific sexual interest in children (roughly equivalent of paedophile rings). CEOP found that 75% of Type 1 offenders were of Asian ethnicity, whereas 100% of Type 2 offenders were white. In a number of cities across the UK, gangs of predominantly British Pakistani men have been convicted for targeting vulnerable white young women and girls. Questions have been raised about the connections between ethnicity and the offenders, and two British-Pakistani researchers from the Quilliam Foundation have said that the link is important. The Foundation, a think-tank which usually focuses on extremism, has chosen to add its voice to the debate with what it describes as an evidence-based view. Quilliam's researchers found 264 people have been convicted for the specific crime of gang grooming since 2005, and of those offenders 222 or 84% were Asian. The report's co-author, Haras Rafiq, spoke to Sky News from his home in Rochdale, one town where members of a sex ring of predominantly British-Pakistani men were jailed for child sexual abuse in 2012. ""I'm from the heart of where one of the biggest high profile cases have happened over the last few years, and I'm saying it's very important that we do talk about it because the problem won't go away,"" he said. ""We didn't want there to be a pattern of people from our ethnic demographic carrying out these attacks. But unfortunately we were proven wrong."" High profile cases like Rochdale have generated negative headlines about the Asian community. The most recent case in Newcastle changed the debate after 17 men and one woman were convicted of nearly 100 offences, and the judge said the grooming wasn't racially motivated. Following the judgment, Mike Penning MP wrote to the Attorney General calling for a review. Nazir Afzal, who is credited with tackling the issue during his time as Chief Crown Prosecutor in the North West, warned the issue of 'Asian' grooming gangs is being used as a recruitment tool by the far-right. Mr Afzal also warned gang grooming was not the most common form of child sexual abuse. ""British white men they tend to work individually. They tend to work online where they groom and they are the majority of perpetrators. When it comes to Asian men or Pakistani men they tend to do it in groups,"" Mr Afzal said."

The Cabinet is set to hold a special debate before Christmas on long-term Brexit aims after Chancellor Philip Hammond stunned MPs this week by admitting there had been no such debate so far. :: Cabinet heavyweights back PM's Brexit breakthrough deal The PM will make a Commons statement to MPs on Monday on her Brussels deal and is likely to be greeted warmly by loyalist Conservative MPs but face some tough challenges from hardline Tory Brexiteers. The Irish border is one issue on which Conservative MPs are likely to criticise the deal, with some Tory backbenchers unhappy that the PM refused to bow to all the demands of the Democratic Unionist Party. ""We now have a report that will go forward next week to the summit which I think we can all broadly accept,"" said Andrew Murrison, the Tory ex-minister who chairs the Northern Ireland Select Committee of MPs. ""But of course the difficulty will be in the next phase and it could be that some of my colleagues have some difficulties along the way. But it's a long road and we're only part way towards a destination."" And despite dropping their veto threat, the DUP's MPs still want changes. Sky News has revealed that the DUP leader Arlene Foster demanded 30 changes to the proposed deal but was forced to settle for just eight. :: EU wanted up to €75bn in Brexit divorce bill - sources Pro-Remain MPs hope to force Government concessions on the EU Withdrawal Bill when its committee stage resumes to the Commons on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. They hope to insert a clause demanding a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit in both Houses of Parliament before the UK leaves the EU and believe the deal achieved in Brussels has strengthened their case. In his Telegraph article, Mr Gove praised Mrs May and said the Brussels breakthrough had been made ""thanks to the Prime Minister's tenacity and skill"". But he said it was ""important to remember that the offer we are making is dependent on securing what we want in the next stage of negotiations"". And repeating his Vote Leave slogans from the EU referendum campaign, he said: ""From the day we leave, we will be able to spend more on our own domestic priorities such as housing, education and the NHS. ""We will have the freedom to negotiate and sign trade agreements with other countries around the world and to regulate our own international trade policy without being fettered by EU law or jurisdiction by the European Court of Justice."""

The argument with the young woman - uploaded to Facebook by the Dartford Rail Travellers Association - appeared to have started because she had her feet up on one of the seats and Mr Vince made an attempt to move them. It quickly escalated and the footage shows her using racial slurs and abusive language. She describes Mr Prince as ""an idiot"" and threatens to ""f****** slap"" him as he attempts to remove her feet from his seat, before descending into a bizarre dispute over the councillor's marriage. The row continues when Mr Prince makes a further attempt to remove the woman's feet from his seat. In his apology, he said: ""I regret getting involved in such a petty dispute. This is one of those situations in which it is better to simply walk away. ""By the end of the journey we were joking with each other and having a pleasant conversation. That said, I'd like to apologise to my fellow commuters for the disturbance our initial disagreement caused."" Mr Prince began his role at the transport committee - which examines the capital's transport system in order to press for improvements - last year. He is also the former leader of Redbridge Council, where he remains a councillor. A Southeastern spokesman said no complaints had been received about his dispute with the woman."

Photographs released by the state-run television channel, KRT, show him at the snow-covered summit of what the media called the ""sublime mountain of revolution"". The state -run agency KCNA said Kim used the opportunity to dwell on the ""emotion-charged days when he realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force without yielding even a moment"". He was also shown visiting facilities in Samjiyon County, a town near Mouth Paektu, as part of his visit. The intercontinental ballistic missile launch took place on 29 November. KCNA said the missile testing means the mainland of America is within its reach. The Japanese government said the missile was in the air for 50 minutes. It was launched on a steep trajectory, but, flattened out, it has a range of 13,000km (8,100m). President Donald Trump said ""we will take care of it"" when questioned about the missile launch. Mount Paektu is considered sacred because Kim Jong Il, their former leader who died in 2011, was said to have been born there. His name is inscribed in the side of the mountain. And the leader's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, is said to have led the fight for his country's independence from Japan from a log cabin at the foot of the mountain. On Friday, scientists and technicians involved in the missile test arrived in Pyongyang to cheering crowds who lined the streets. US experts have said it does seem as though North Korea is just two or three tests away from being combat-ready."

He was left with serious burns to his head and body and is now deaf in one ear following the attack in Beckton, east London on 21 June. His cousin, Resham Khan, was also injured in the assault, which happened as the pair travelled in a car after celebrating her 21st birthday. Mr Muhktar told Sky News: ""I feel like it's destroyed my life. ""I'm still in severe pain. I can't move my head left to right. I'm deaf in one ear. I can hardly walk.

Mr Muhktar was temporary blinded but kept driving to flee Tomlin's attack before eventually mounting a pavement and crashing a short distance away. ""I was burning, screaming, shouting, kicking on doors, screaming for water. It was a nightmare,"" Mr Mukhtar said. His injuries were so severe that he was placed in an induced coma in hospital. The corrosive substance melted both victims' skin and clothes, as well as the car's seats and dashboard, Scotland Yard said. Police revealed this week the UK has one of the worst levels of recorded acid attacks in the world, with new figures suggesting there are now more than 800 reported incidents a year. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has proposed banning the sale of acids to under-18s and new laws to make it an offence to possess a corrosive substance in public without ""good reason"". Jaf Shah, executive director at the Acid Survivors Trust International, told Sky News: ""Beyond the physical pain and disabling injuries, survivors of acid attacks suffer PTSD, depression and social isolation. ""As a consequence the path to recovery is long and complex, therefore it is essential that survivors are able to access high quality on-going mental health and psychosocial support to rebuild their lives."" The NHS says victims of acid attacks can ask to be referred to a hospital mental health liaison team for support and treatment. Support groups such as Changing Faces and the Katie Piper Foundation also provide help to victims and their families, it said."

A detour was put into operation but the motorway itself was closed in both directions between junctions 29 and 28 near Exeter. Devon and Cornwall Police have said the incident followed concerns for a man on a bridge that crosses over the motorway. But shortly before 9pm they tweeted: ""Pleased to inform you all that the man is off the bridge and is in the hands of mental health professional receiving support."" The operation to clear the road is still going on. It came after hours of officers appealing for people to stay calm. Some drivers stuck in the queue had been asking for travel information from police, while others offered prayers for the person involved. And while some asked for tips on keeping themselves entertained while at a standstill, there were people asking for food and others offering snacks to those in vehicles around them. Driver Sara Morgan Broom tweeted: ""On M5 I've not moved since 4.20 pretty cold now it's been nearly 4 hrs. Hope they save the person on the bridge... no fun for anyone."""

After 90 minutes of trying to free him, his friends called an ambulance crew to the address in Fordhouses, Wolverhampton on Thursday afternoon. Paramedics were unable to help and so West Midlands Fire Service was called, resulting in a rescue operation that tied up five firefighters for almost an hour and cost £650. Because the 22-year-old's life was in danger the fire service will have to foot the bill. Mr Swingler tweeted that he was ""very lucky to be alive"" and had been left ""traumatised"". However, many of his YouTube fans were not sympathetic, suggesting he should apologise and cover the cost of his rescue. One commented: ""You should count yourself lucky and think twice whether you're ever going to put your life at risk again. ""What frustrates me the most is that the time paramedics have spent with you may had affected someone's else survival."" Another said: ""Do the right thing and give (West Midlands Fire Service) the money"". Mr Swingler has hit back at claims he wasted the emergency services' time and diverted crews away from other incidents. In a video posted on Friday, he said he was ""in need and would have died without (firefighters)"", adding he should be fined for the stunt. He said: ""I'm more than happy to donate my money to the people who helped me that day. ""I should be fined just like the people who get into drunken fights and use the emergency services' time."" West Midlands Fire Service said it was ""seriously unimpressed"" with the stunt. Station commander Simon Woodward added: ""We pride ourselves on our five-minute attendance standard. ""That means that if we have an incident where there is life at risk, our appliances will be there within five minutes and that gives us our best chance to save that life. ""If we're attending incidents that are YouTube videos where we have people who've been irresponsible, those crews are unable to attend those life-risk incidents. ""The service charge for that would be £650. We are not going to charge because his life was in danger. What I would like to do is to remind everybody not to put their lives at risk for the sake of other people's entertainment."""

Lions and senior team members were out in a bar in Perth on Thursday evening after having a midnight curfew lifted that day. No members of the public were involved in the incident and England team security were present, it is understood. Left-hand top-order batsman Duckett has now been suspended by the England and Wales Cricket Board and is facing a disciplinary investigation. Team mate Joe Clarke has replaced the Northants player for the game at Richardson Park in Perth where several full Ashes squad cricketers are being rested. Duckett's suspension is another blow for England cricket, after Jonny Bairstow was accused of ""headbutbutting"" Australia batsman Cameron Bancroft in a Perth bar at the beginning of the Ashes tour in November. Players were then given a midnight curfew which was only lifted on Thursday. Bairstow, 28, on Friday claimed he was ""stitched up"" by Australia and said his headbutt was simply a greeting and a case of ""boys being boys"". :: Cricket Australia v England scoreboard :: Moeen Ali plays down 'kebab shop' comment directed at him during the Ashes In September all-rounder Ben Stokes, 26, was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm following a fight outside a Bristol nightclub. After the Bairstow incident, director of cricket Andrew Strauss denied the England team had a drinking culture. He warned they must be ""smarter"" with the situations they place themselves in. He said: ""We need to sharpen up our act. ""The players are adults - intelligent adults - and sometimes they are not using that intelligence in the right way. ""The last thing any of us want is to be in the news for the wrong reasons and I will be reminding the players of their obligations."" England are 2-0 down in the Ashes series and will lose the urn if the Australians win the third Test in Perth, which starts on Thursday."

Gavin Williamson had suggested UK fighters should not be allowed to come home, telling the Daily Mail: ""A dead terrorist can't cause any harm to Britain. I do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country. ""We should do everything we can to destroy and eliminate that threat."" But Baroness Chakrabarti, a former civil liberties campaigner, said the comments were ""very disappointing"" and that jihadis should be treated like other criminals and brought to justice. She told Sky's Niall Paterson: ""If you're on the battlefield then you have to fight whoever is opposing you on the battlefield. ""If he's suggesting targeted assassinations of criminals who should instead be brought to justice, that is appalling and we do not want to hear a Defence Secretary abrogate the rule of law. ""Because the rule of law is what brave men and women who join our armed forces and put their lives at risk, that's what they do it for - for the rule of law at home and abroad."" Mr Williamson's comments sparked a row when former director of public prosecutions Lord MacDonald, who sits as a Liberal Democrat peer, branded them ""a juvenile response"" that ""belong in a Netflix series"". But the Defence Secretary appeared to have Downing Street's backing. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said this week that the Government's policy was that ""if you travel to Iraq and Syria and if you are fighting with our enemies there then you make yourself a legitimate target"". More than 800 UK citizens are thought to have gone to fight for IS in Iraq and Syria. Around half have returned, some 130 have been killed and an estimated 270 are thought to be still in the field. Two years ago, Jeremy Corbyn responded to the death of IS executioner Jihadi John - real name Mohammed Emwazi - in a targeted air strike by saying it would have been better to hold him to account for his ""callous and brutal crimes"" in court. Mr Williamson has also been hitting the headlines weeks into his new role amid reports of clashes with chancellor Philip Hammond. Mr Hammond's allies have compared Mr Williamson to Private Pike, the naive character in Dad's Army. The Defence Secretary's allies appear to have retaliated, as a story emerged that the Treasury had failed to pay for the Chancellor's use of an official RAF plane."
2017-12-10,The UK's pensions lifeboat is weighing whether to reject a restructuring proposal for Toys R Us's British operations amid questions about a big loan write-off and bonuses awarded to company bosses.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171211023611/https://news.sky.com/story/pensions-lifeboat-could-sink-plan-for-toys-r-us-uk-revamp-11165610,"Sky News has learnt that the pension trustees of Toys R‎ Us in the UK have appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the professional services firm, to advise them on a plan unveiled last week that will involve closing a quarter of its British stores. Sources said this weekend that PwC's appointment had been made with ""the explicit encouragement"" of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-funded body which funds the retirement obligations of bankrupt companies with defined benefit pension schemes. The PPF and the trustees have not definitively decided to oppose the so-called Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), a mechanism which shields financially troubled businesses from their‎ creditors. However, insiders said this weekend that the PPF, which could end up taking on the scheme, was concerned that the CVA proposal may be ""simply kicking the can down the road"". One pension industry source said the PPF shared reservations expressed by the Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, about the decision by Toys R Us UK to wave loans worth more than £580m to a holding company in the British Virgin Islands. The UK pension scheme is thought to hold roughly 20% of the creditors' votes‎ eligible to be cast in the CVA, giving it a potentially decisive say in whether the plan gets approved. The restructuring will require the approval of a 75% majority of the company's creditors, and is expected to result in making well over 500 of Toys R Us's UK staff redundant. It will also entail closing at least 26 of its 100 British shops. Alvarez & Marsal, a specialist adviser on corporate insolvencies, is handling the CVA proposal. All of the affected Toys 'R' Us shops will remain trading throughout the Christmas period and well into the new year, but will begin closing from next spring. The chain's larger out-of-town stores will be disproportionately affected by the closure plan, owing to their weak performance amid a fast-changing outlook for the high street. ""Our newer, smaller, more interactive stores are in the right shopping locations and are trading well, while our new website has generated significant growth in online and click-and-collect sales,"" Steve Knights, Toys R Us's UK managing director said last week. ""But the warehouse-style stores we opened in the 1980s and 1990s, while successful in the early days, are too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment. ""The business has been loss-making in recent years and so we need to take strong and decisive action to accelerate the transformation."" It was unclear whether other Toys R Us landlords and other creditors will be prepared to back the proposal, although industry analysts believe the business will have a bleak future unless it is approved. In Britain, retailers including BHS, Focus DIY and JJB Sports have all used CVAs to exit loss-making stores, although all three companies ultimately succumbed to the fast-changing retail environment. Toys 'R' Us's UK operations are understood to have been loss-making in seven of the last eight financial years. Accounts for the year to January show turnover of £418m, on which it made an operating loss of £0.5m. The effort to overhaul its UK estate follows the filing by Toys 'R' Us's American parent for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. That move has sparked controversy over the company's move to pay up to $21m in bonuses to top executives, which it claims is necessary to motivate them during the critical Christmas trading season.In a statement issued on Sunday, a PPF spokesperson said: ''We are working closely with the trustees of the Toys R Us pension scheme given the current CVA proposals. ""The filing of CVA proposals means that an assessment period is automatically triggered for a pension scheme. ""However, this does not mean that the scheme, or its members, will be transferred into the PPF. ""Whatever the outcome of the CVA the pension scheme members can be reassured that they remain protected."""

The premiere for Star Wars: The Last Jedi did not disappoint, with a squad of elite guards clad in red armour and some of the franchise's most beloved characters impressing the crowds at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium. Marching under a towering model of an assault vehicle down the red carpet, famous droids including R2-D2, C-3PO and BB-8 arrived before the film's stars. Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey, arrived in a shiny strapless dress emblazoned with stars. She said: ""I mean, it's just fun. It's fun. ""And I feel fun.

Carrie Fisher, the original Leia, also returns in the film and had completed filming shortly before she died of cardiac arrest aged 60 in December last year. Before Saturday only a select group of VIPs had watched the film and secrecy remained in place during the premiere. Anthony Daniels, who plays C-3PO, told a reporter looking for details on the film: ""Im going to let you work out everything for yourself."" Critics who got to watch the film have heaped their praise on Ridley. Terri Schwartz, editorial manager at IGN, tweeted: ""Not only are Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill at their very best as Leia and Luke in this movie, but Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver blow Rey and Kylo Ren out of the park.

Among those taking part are Liam Gallagher, Deacon Blue, Frightened Rabbit, Rob Brydon, and Amy Macdonald. John Cleese performed a bedtime story, while Sir Bob Geldof addressed the crowd. Speaking to Sky News at the event, Geldof spoke of his days of being homeless in London: ""I slept on the street and I found a church in Holborn, a crypt, where they gave you bit of a sponge that you could sleep on. ""My great fear was that at the age I am now I would be on a park bench and would be starting vacantly and listlessly at nothing."" Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney, Communities Secretary Angela Constance and Housing Minister Kevin Stewart are also spending the night in the gardens. Event organiser Josh Littlejohn, co-founder of Social Bite which helps the homeless through cafes, a restaurant and fundraising events, said he was ""humbled"" by the support. ""It looks like we're going to have about 8,000 people come and sleep out which is mind-blowing really for a country like Scotland, a small country, to get behind a cause like that,"" he said. ""That's going to translate to somewhere in the region of between £3m and £4m that's going to be raised. It's an absolutely incredible result."" He said the famous names lend ""excitement"" to the occasion but people had turned up for the cause of tackling homelessness rather than as music fans. He added: ""This concept of sleeping in the cold is such a daunting thing in people's mind that it trumps Liam Gallagher and it trumps anyone else, but it just helps lend that level of excitement and gets people engaged in the issue, so we're really grateful for everyone that's turned out to support."" Singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald said: ""It seems absolutely ludicrous that in 2017 that people are still sleeping out on the streets. It doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to stop. Hopefully the money goes a long way to try and help that. ""It's just crazy in this day and age, it shouldn't happen any more and it's really great that there are charities like Social Bite willing to try and help, and try and make a difference."""

The body will also assess whether the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which owned the building, failed in its duty to protect life and provide safe housing. The fire tore through the Grenfell block on 14 June, killing 71 people, spreading quickly because of flammable material installed during a recent refurbishment. An official inquiry will be led by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, but its scope has been criticised, particularly the decision not to look at social housing. If Sir Martin's report, due in the spring, is delayed as officials fear, the EHRC's observations could be released before his, with their release date set for April 2018. But the commission said it is not intended to be adversarial. EHRC chairman David Isaac told the Observer: ""It's to be complementary to it. We will be calling on experts, particularly legal experts, looking at the international human rights obligations, asking for submissions from a whole variety of stakeholders. ""It's not a parallel inquiry. It's to look at what we think is important and what's missing from the official inquiry, which is the human rights and equalities perspective."" The Government will have to respond to a petition launched by families of the victims and the Grenfell United group that drew more than 10,000 signatures, including the support of Adele. The petition calls for an overhaul of the inquiry. It calls on Prime Minister Theresa May to install a more diverse range of people to sit on a panel with Sir Martin. Mr Isaac said: ""We are the UK's national human rights body and we have a statutory duty to promote equality and human rights. ""We think the human rights dimension to Grenfell Tower is absolutely fundamental and is currently overlooked. ""Grenfell for most people in this country, particularly in the way the Government has reacted, is a pretty defining moment in terms of how inequality is perceived."""

Jaf Shah, executive director at the Acid Survivors Trust International, told Sky News: ""Beyond the physical pain and disabling injuries, survivors of acid attacks suffer PTSD, depression and social isolation. ""As a consequence the path to recovery is long and complex, therefore it is essential that survivors are able to access high quality on-going mental health and psychosocial support to rebuild their lives."" The NHS says victims of acid attacks can ask to be referred to a hospital mental health liaison team for support and treatment. Support groups such as Changing Faces and the Katie Piper Foundation also provide help to victims and their families, it said."
2017-12-10,"Kenny Alexander, the chief executive of gaming firm GVC Holdings, is known to like a flutter.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171211023611/https://news.sky.com/story/the-gambler-driving-gvcs-bid-for-ladbrokes-coral-11160038,"He proved it again today when the company he heads - which owns brands including Foxy Bingo, Sportingbet, CasinoClub, Cashcade and Party Poker - tabled a bid for Ladbrokes Coral. Scotsman Mr Alexander has already tried twice during the last year to snare Ladbrokes Coral. He is clearly hoping that this will be a case of third time lucky. What is unusual about the timing of today's announcement is that, while GVC had always been expected to have another tilt at Ladbrokes, the assumption was that it would wait until the Government had completed its review of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) - the lucrative but highly controversial gaming machines that sit in every high street bookmaker. :: Ladbrokes Coral in talks on takeover by GVC The review is likely to impose a lower maximum stake per spin on the machines which, depending on how low the figure is, is likely to take a chunk out of the profits of bookmakers. Accordingly, GVC could have been forgiven for waiting a while to see what the Department for Culture, Media and Sport came up with, not least because confusion over the issue has clouded previous negotiations over how to value Ladbrokes. GVC's solution has been to come up with a clever formula under which the eventual sum it pays will depend on the outcome of the review and values Ladbrokes at anywhere between £3.1bn and £3.9bn. The combined business is expected to be worth some £5.7bn and would qualify for membership of the FTSE 100. Yet only as recently as September, Mr Alexander - who has taken GVC from being an Aim-listed minnow to a £2.75bn member of the FTSE 250 in a decade - was insisting he would ""definitely...not be doing anything before the outcome of the review"". What will startle casual observers is the way in which GVC, a 13-year old business few outside the City will have heard of, is in a position to snaffle an established company boasting two of the best-known names in the industry. Joe Coral, after all, launched his bookmaking business 91 years ago while Ladbrokes dates back even further, to 1886. That reflects dramatic changes in the gaming industry, in particular the explosive growth of online betting, but also the rapid growth of GVC itself via a series of mergers and acquisitions. Founded in 2004, as Luxembourg-based Gaming VC Holdings, its meteoric growth began when, in March 2007, Kilmarnock-supporting Mr Alexander - who will head the combined GVC and Ladbrokes - became chief executive. After a string of smaller deals, the first big one came when, in 2013, GVC teamed up with William Hill to buy the online sports betting business Sportingbet. Then, in 2015, it outbid rival 888 Holdings to pay £1.1bn for Bwin.Party, a fallen star of the gaming sector formed from the merger of the former Real Madrid shirt sponsor Bwin and the former FTSE 100 member PartyGaming. This was the boldest roll of the dice yet for Mr Alexander as, at the time, Bwin.Party was more than twice the size of GVC. Again, as with Sportingbet, he and his colleagues proved adept at successfully integrating another business. But Ladbrokes Coral, even at the lower end of the price range being mooted, is a much bigger beast than anything GVC has previously taken on and, like Bwin.Party, it is larger than GVC itself. Moreover, unlike Sportingbet and Bwin.Party, it is not a purely digital business but one boasting physical assets in the form of 3,700 high street betting shops. Mr Alexander has, in the recent past, made clear his preference for acquiring online gaming businesses ahead of ones owning bookmaking shops because the former tend to be more highly valued by investors than the latter. By contrast, he was today talking about how the ""enlarged group would be an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business that would benefit from a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy"". Aside from Mr Alexander's apparent conversion to the joys of high street betting shops, this deal raises several questions. One is whether this deal fires the starting pistol on another round of consolidation in the betting industry. Betfair has already joined forces with Paddy Power but the likes of 888 Holdings, William Hill, Jackpotjoy and Canadian firm Stars Group, owner of the PokerStars website, are all expected to participate in further tie-ups. So too could Mecca bingo and Grosvenor casino operator Rank and SkyBet, in which Sky plc, the parent of Sky News, has a minority shareholding. At least as intriguing is how Bet365 - along with GVC and Paddy Power Betfair, one of the three biggest global players in online sports betting - reacts to all this. And the biggest question of all is whether the DCMS could yet disrupt the industrial logic of this deal by confounding everyone with its review of FOBTs."

I remember playing in Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk when I was younger with my friends; playing games like ""knock down ginger"" those were the good old days. I remember when my uncle first got his flat in the top floor of Grenfell Tower sometime in 2013 and how happy he was. I remember him being excited about how he was going to decorate and put together his new home. He liked the fact he lived on the top floor, he said he was ""closer to God"" and that also made him happy. He could see the Westway football pitches from his flat where I regularly played and he would sometimes watch me and message me after playing making fun of how rubbish I was. My uncle Hesham was a very funny man with a huge heart and was described by his friends as a kind and generous man. In the early hours of 14 June this year I was woken up by my wife screaming ""Grenfell Tower is on fire, call Uncle Hesham."" My uncle's phone kept ringing with no answer. My grandmother heard from him last at around 3am. Later we learned he didn't make it out of the tower. He had trouble walking and often used a walking stick so would have struggled to make it down the stairs from the top floor. He tragically died alone in his flat and many others perished that night in the tower. He was identified on 25 August and finally laid to rest on 30 September. The Grenfell Tower fire has broken the hearts of our close community but above all it has united us in the fight for justice, to make sure that a tragedy of this scale will never happen again. I know it is going to be a long journey and it may uncover some ugly and uncomfortable truths but it's important we don't give up. The more we learn about the circumstances surrounding the Grenfell Tower fire and its refurbishment the angrier we all get. This could have been avoided if the concerns of the residents were taken seriously and weren't ignored. Our anger has now turned into determination to fight for justice. Perhaps that horrific night would have not happened if our Government learned lessons from previous fires and implemented recommendations from their inquiries. There are so many things that went wrong and collectively, directly and indirectly contributed to the Grenfell Tower fire. We know that the public inquiry will be a very complex process, and myself and others believe that it should not be left to one person. This is why we have asked the Prime Minister to appoint a panel to sit alongside the judge and will have the same powers as him to report back to her. We have been corresponding with Theresa May since August this year requesting this panel, and still until now she has not made a decision. We feel ignored and our concerns are not being listened to - that is why the bereaved, survivors, community and with the help and support of Grenfell United have all come together in the hope that collectively are voices will be heard. We have started a petition calling on the PM to listen to our concerns and we want a fair public inquiry that will get to the truth and make the right recommendations which our Government will implement this time!"

They were part of a larger group all understood to have taken the drug, but the two teenagers died in hospital shortly after. Aaron Reilly's family described him as a responsible young man who made ""one silly mistake"". ""Aaron was a much loved son, brother, grandson and boyfriend. He loved to skate, play computer games. Like most teenage lads he liked a night out with his friends and was respected by them as a non-drug user,"" they said. Relatives of Joshua Brock said what happened that night was ""so totally out of character as he was always against drug taking in any shape or form"". ""One moment of madness led to this tragedy,"" the family statement added. An 18-year-old man who was arrested in connection with the incident has been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

Under the proposals, a student on a shorter course would pay £22,200 in tuition fees, compared with £27,750 for a standard three-year degree. But Labour said the proposals were ""another plan to raise tuition fees"" as the current maximum annual fee for a typical three-year course is £9,250. Universities minister Jo Johnson said students on the shorter courses could benefit overall by around £25,000, through savings on tuition fees and earning an average starting salary of £19,000, instead of spending a third year studying. He told Sky News: ""There are some students, particularly mature students, who want to retrain, develop new skills and find a new role in the workforce, and they may be put off by a traditional three-year course which is the dominant mode of studying higher education at university today. ""There are also going to be hungry, driven, motivated students who may be put off by a three-year course, who want a faster pace of learning and a quicker route into work."" :: Quiz: Do you know the real value of university? But concerns have been raised about the impact shorter courses could have on issues such as university staff contracts and research. Students choosing accelerated courses have to work more intensively, while their holidays would be significantly shorter than on traditional degree programmes. A spokesman for the Russell Group, which represents 24 leading UK universities, said: ""I don't think any university is necessarily ruling two-year courses out, but there are practical reasons why three-year programmes have generally been considered the most appropriate way to deliver courses at research-intensive institutions."" Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ""Several universities have been offering two-year, fast-track degrees for a number of years, but demand has been limited under the current system."" Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""It seems that every higher education policy from this government comes with another plan to raise tuition fees, with students on part time degrees now facing charges of over £11,000 a year. ""With universities facing uncertainty over Brexit, ministers must address concerns like the impact on staff workload before imposing more major changes."""

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed Clifford died in hospital on 10 December. ""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an investigation by the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman,"" the spokesman said. ""Our condolences are with Mr Clifford's family at this difficult time."" Clifford's daughter Louise told the Mail on Sunday that her father first collapsed in his cell while he was trying to clean it on Thursday. ""It was just too much,"" she said. ""Next day he collapsed again and was unconscious for several minutes. ""He was seen by a nurse, who insisted he must be transferred to a local hospital. ""That's where he had his cardiac arrest, later on Friday."" Clifford was jailed in May 2014 after he was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault against four women between 1977 and 1984. He had been arrested under Operation Yewtree, the Scotland Yard investigation launched in October 2012 after the late Jimmy Savile was exposed as a prolific paedophile. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Anthony Leonard told Clifford he had led a ""double existence"", living an outwardly respectable life while grooming young women for abuse. One woman who came forward after the trial to allege that she too had been sexually manipulated by Clifford was Sarah Symonds, a relationships expert from South Wales. She described to Sky News a lewd encounter in his central London offices and then being manipulated into meeting the publicist in the disabled toilet. She told Sky News: ""I hope wherever he is that he is away from women, and, at the same time, somebody high up there is promising him a better future as long as he 'just does certain things'. ""The only downside about him dying is that now he will not have to suffer the shame of coming out of prison one day and trying to rebuild his life after being left with nothing."" :: Sky Reporter - Why Clifford crept up behind me and messed around During his PR career, Clifford's clients included boxer Muhammad Ali, music mogul Simon Cowell and the late reality TV star Jade Goody. He first came to the public's attention after creating the Sun's infamous headline ""Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster"" in 1986 - a story the publicist later admitted was a complete fallacy. Clifford's first wife, Liz, died in 2003. His second wife, Clifford's former PA Jo Westwood, divorced him in 2014 following his indecent assault convictions. He was reportedly due to appeal against all his convictions in early 2018 on the basis of fresh evidence."

It was made by Mark Edwards MBE, the same Richmond-based boat builder responsible for the Queen's barge, Gloriana. The charity Hubbub has teamed up with the City Bridge Trust, the City of London's charitable funder, to run 55 free trips for children from over 25 London schools - out on the water around London Docklands. It is using the trips to ""fish"" plastic and other floating litter out of the water - which can then be safely disposed of or recycled. Some of it will also go towards building more boats like Poly-Mer.

""Here in London, 300 tonnes (of litter) are cleared from the river each year,"" said Gavin Ellis, the director and co-founder of Hubbub, the charity running the outings. ""That's just what's cleared from the river, not to mention what sinks down to the bottom, what's swept out to sea. So it's a huge issue and in terms of the wildlife within the river, 75% of the fish that feed on the bottom of the river bed have plastic in their guts."" The idea behind the trips is to show children just where the plastic they use every day often ends up. ""It's sad to see all the plastic in the river but it's also happy that there are so many people who are willing to help,"" 10-year-old Gabby from Canary Wharf College told Sky News, when we got exclusive access to one of Poly Mer's first plastic fishing outings.

It is about loyalty. It is their community, it is organised. They don't just use girls for themselves, it is to traffic them. Girls and women are viewed as beneath men, they are there to cook, clean and provide children. They target anyone that they see. We have seen it is more white children, but I think that white children are more open to coming forward to report abuse. Of course it is happening to black girls and Pakistani girls - I remember girls of different races but they don't want to come forward because if they do, they are pushed out of their community. They are told they will not be able to marry, it is almost as if they are blamed more for their abuse. But in white families, they are more likely to be open to stand by their child. For those with Asian heritage, it brings shame to the community. The Pakistani community are very much about dealing with it themselves, they do not want outside people coming in. A lot of work needs to be done about that, giving girls and women a voice. A young Pakistani girl contacted me recently to tell me she had gone to the police with exploitation allegations, but she isn't telling her community, because she fears she won't be able to marry. She must face this alone without a support network. It is really sad.

We are labelled as racist. Yet we can say that the majority of paedophiles are white men. I have not been offended by that, and I don't think it is sending out the message that every man is growing up to be a paedophile. What we have at the moment is a Groundhog Day situation. We have a court case, it is a group of Pakistani males and we talk about it - but then it's labelled as racist and it gets buried. Then we end up with another case and more talking, but the cycle repeats. We need stronger voices, like more Nazir Azfals, who speak up from within the community.

For those people affected by the Grenfell fire and living in the community, the initial hearings are highly anticipated and significant. Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle in the blaze, says it marks a big step forward. :: Human rights commission to launch own Grenfell review ""This is now the beginning of a long journey for justice and will obviously run alongside the criminal investigation,"" he said. ""We want to see how the hearings will be controlled and conducted, how much involvement we will have, what will the judge, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, be like and his assessors. There are a lot of expectations."" For Karim the most important aspect, however, is to see if the bereaved families will be listened to. With the support of other families, he has set up a petition calling on the Prime Minister Theresa May to appoint an independent panel to sit alongside the judge and be able to observe the decisions he makes. So far the petition has attracted more than 15,000 signatures, including singer Adele and actor Noel Clarke, but Karim says he is yet to have even an acknowledgement from Downing Street. ""There feels like there's a major detachment between the Government and those running the public inquiry and us, so we feel an independent panel is very important to make us feel we have some participation and confidence that our concerns will be listened to."" When Sky News pressed the Government for comment, a Government spokesperson said: ""The Prime Minister has given a commitment to consider the inquiry panel after the chair determined what further expertise he required and this process is ongoing. ""We would like to assure all those affected by the tragedy that legal representatives of core participants will receive all relevant evidence, be able to offer opening and closing statements at hearings and will be able to suggest lines of questioning for witnesses."" Nicolette Del Gallo, a local volunteer who helps support survivors, says she is worried about the legal support some families have received. She said: ""I'm increasingly concerned at the number of families who don't have adequate and specialised legal representation, who haven't received interim payments that would be enough to put them into private rental now. :: Grenfell inquiry risks being whitewash without diverse panel, say families ""There is a grave need for housing. I'm appalled that the inquiry documents have so many criteria as to what is acceptable for people to ask questions about. ""The support system has failed from day one and it is continuing to do so in various areas. The community needs to be listened to directly."""
2017-12-10,"David Davis says the UK can negotiate a ""bespoke"" trade deal with the EU more wide-ranging than the one with Canada within less than a year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171211023611/https://news.sky.com/story/david-davis-promises-bespoke-eu-trade-deal-within-eight-months-11164912,"The EU's deal with Canada, which came into force in September, took seven years to negotiate. But it does not extend to services - which are seen as crucial for Britain's financial sector. In his first TV interview since Theresa May struck a deal with Brussels on the divorce issues, the Brexit Secretary claimed striking a free trade deal with arrangements for specific sectors ""is not that complicated"". Trade talks with the EU are set to begin next year following Theresa May's last-minute breakthrough in Brussels on Friday on the divorce issues of money, EU citizens and the Northern Irish border. Mr Davis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that Britain could have a better deal than those the EU has signed with other third countries in recent years. ""What we want is a bespoke outcome. We'll probably start with the best of Canada, and the best of Japan and the best of South Korea and then add to that the bit that's missing, which is the services,"" he said. Mr Davis said he was aiming for a ""Canada plus plus plus"" agreement. Asked whether it was realistic to strike such a deal within eight months, as it is expected would need to be present it to the EU27 next October, he claimed such a deal could be signed ""minutes"" after Britain's official departure date at the end of March 2019. Mrs May is poised for Cabinet tensions between her Brexiteers and former Remain supporters to be aired next week, when her top team discusses the shape of a future trade deal for the first time. ""It's not that complicated,"" Mr Davis responded to the reports. ""We want an over-arching free trade deal which has no tariffs. Negotiating every tariff is what takes a long time and we start from a position of complete convergence with the EU. ""It's not just my vision, it's what was discussed in cabinet already before the Lancaster House speech and the Florence speech, which is an over-arching free trade deal but including services, which Canada doesn't have, and with individual specific arrangements for aviation, for nuclear, for data, for a whole series of strands which we've worked out. ""It's more like a years in truth rather than eight months, we can't sign until after we leave."""
2017-12-10,"The Prime Minister will be delighted to have negotiated the Brexit process to this point of ""sufficient progress"" on initial divorce matters.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171211023611/https://news.sky.com/story/pms-brexit-fudge-recipe-might-yet-leave-bad-taste-11161422,"But the progress, as well as being delayed by a couple of months, is not as far as she would have wanted. Immediate discussions will begin on a transition period, before talks about trade, which will still take some time to prepare internally by the 27 other EU member states. On Northern Ireland, the important point is Mrs May and her diplomats managed, in the early hours of Friday, to square off both Dublin and Belfast on the thorny issue of the Irish border. The change in words within Friday's agreed text were more about providing clarity rather than a fundamental change in the meaning of what had already been agreed on Monday. Instead of ""full regulatory alignment"", the new wording is ""full alignment with the rules"" of the EU's single market and customs union, which underpin the Good Friday Agreement and an open border. The recipe of the fudge has changed only a little, but sufficiently enough for the DUP to claim to have won ""six substantive changes"" to the wording. The key point is the position on Monday had left until the second phase of Brexit negotiations the precise degree of ""alignment"" required to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Dublin and Brussels believes this will be widespread, touching upon dozens of areas, but Belfast thinks it is just two or three. Over the past week the UK was quite literally negotiating with itself amid talks in Whitehall between the UK Government and Northern Ireland's DUP. The other substantive point of compromise in Friday's agreement is the length of a referral period for the European Court of Justice to enforce the rights of EU citizens. Both sides have compromised here. The EU asked for 15 years' of jurisdiction, the UK for five years. They have opted for eight years. It seems this is acceptable for Tory Brexiteers, but that is not what they were saying only a few months ago. This speaks to a wider truth. The real story of Brexit's first phase is how the Prime Minister has managed to get her own MPs to wear a series of compromises: on transition, sequencing, financial settlement, rights and potentially Ireland, too. Brexiteer MPs have shown that when push comes to shove, any Brexit is better than the risk of a Government collapse meaning no Brexit. Effectively, phase two negotiations are now for agreeing a transition period while phase three is for trade talks. A transition period will see Britain remain in the customs union and single market for two years. European Council President Donald Tusk revealed the UK has asked for this, but also warned it will mean Britain is obliged to accept new EU laws during the period. In practice, this will not change a great deal over the two years, but had previously been ruled out by Brexiteers. We are still some months from talking about trade, and years from actual trade talks. The really difficult stuff is now deciding the Brexit end state. Should it be high alignment and high access to the EU, such as a Norway-style deal? Or will it be low alignment and low access, such as a Canada-style trade deal? The question is whether the fall-back position for the Irish border of ""full alignment"" with the EU pre-configures that shape in some way. Logically one would presume so. If there's no deal, then we get full alignment. The idea that a deal would then see low alignment seems unlikely. But ministerial sources are adamant this is a red herring. They say Britain will enjoy full regulatory independence, there will be outcome equivalence but autonomy on reaching those outcomes, and the terms of Friday's deal on the Irish border are just a contingency. Longstanding Brexiteers would have preferred the word ""equivalence"" in Friday's agreement, and some trust has been lost by the fact this was not cleared in advance by the Cabinet sub-committee. They are still concerned and this will now be thrashed out in Cabinet as early as next week. The big winners here are the business community, who forced Number 10 to do whatever it takes to achieve a quickly agreed transition deal. That is why quick compromises were made by Mrs May. The second phase of negotiations will be even harder. A fudge only goes so far. It is an achievement for the Prime Minister to have got here. It is a significant achievement to have got the Cabinet and the DUP to sign up to this. But the real victory would be to get all her MPs on side. It is unclear if that is the case."

2017-12-10,Max Clifford was bored. Max wanted to amuse himself.

It was in April 2014, midway through a long trial. In the cold light of day, within the drab confines of Southwark Crown Court, legal teams were dissecting his whole backstory - his professional prowess as a self-styled 'PR guru', his love life, the size of his manhood, his seedy encounters and the many many power games he had played with young women over the years. The moment outside court wasn't live on air and therefore we sat on the footage until the end of the trial. After careful consideration my editor and I concluded it had to be broadcast - she agreed it was the clearest evidence of Clifford's disregard for the appalling list of charges he faced. Neither was it a one off. There were other moments inside the court building during the trial where he clearly got a kick out of making suggestive comments to female journalists covering the case with me. In sentencing Clifford to eight years the judge, Anthony Leonard QC, made it quite clear that he'd seen the footage and how unimpressed he was. It may even have added to his sentence, something that gives me no satisfaction. It was simply the right thing to do. News of his death, three and a half years into his sentence - and therefore possibly not far from a parole date - will be devastating for his daughter Louise, his friends and colleagues. I do feel sympathy for them, but I also think of the women whose lives were tormented by their encounters with Max Clifford the sexual predator. Those women found justice in 2014. The collective strength of their evidence convicted somebody who thought he was untouchable. Someone who thought he could do anything. Ultimately that is how many people will remember him."

The tombs, which are located just across the Nile from Luxor, were found by German archaeologist Frederica Kampp in the 1990s. They were found in an area known as the Dra Abu el Naga necropolis, near to the Temple of Hatshepsut and the Valley of the Kings, where the treasures of Tutankhamun were found. They are believed to date back to the ancient Egyptian dynasties of the New Kingdom, which lasted from 1,550-1,070 BC. Authorities are exploring the tombs as Egypt attempts to encourage tourists to visit its ancient sites. Antiquities Minister Khaled al Enany announced the discovery in Luxor, one of Egypt's tourist centres. ""It's truly an exceptional day,"" he said. ""The 18th dynasty private tombs were already known. But it's the first time to enter inside the two tombs."" The antiquities ministry said archaeologists found ""a mummy wrapped in linen"" which studies suggested ""could be for a top official or a powerful person"". It added that it believed the mummy could be of ""a person named Djehuty Mes whose name was engraved on one of the walls"". Alternately, it could belong to ""the scribe Maati, as his name and the name of his wife Mehi were inscribed on 50 funerary cones found in the tomb's rectangular chamber"". Only one of the two tombs was excavated. The ministry said: ""The tomb has a court lined with stone and mud-brick walls. It has a six-metre deep burial shaft at its southern side that lead to four side chambers."" ""Studies reveal that the tomb was reused in antiquity,"" the ministry added. The explored tomb contained a depiction of ""a person, probably the deceased's brother, presenting offerings and flowers to the deceased and his wife"" according to the ministry."

Photographs released by the state-run television channel, KRT, show him at the snow-covered summit of what the media called the ""sublime mountain of revolution"". The state -run agency KCNA said Kim used the opportunity to dwell on the ""emotion-charged days when he realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force without yielding even a moment"". He was also shown visiting facilities in Samjiyon County, a town near Mouth Paektu, as part of his visit. The intercontinental ballistic missile launch took place on 29 November. KCNA said the missile testing means the mainland of America is within its reach. The Japanese government said the missile was in the air for 50 minutes. It was launched on a steep trajectory, but, flattened out, it has a range of 13,000km (8,100m). President Donald Trump said ""we will take care of it"" when questioned about the missile launch. Mount Paektu is considered sacred because Kim Jong Il, their former leader who died in 2011, was said to have been born there. His name is inscribed in the side of the mountain. And the leader's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, is said to have led the fight for his country's independence from Japan from a log cabin at the foot of the mountain. On Friday, scientists and technicians involved in the missile test arrived in Pyongyang to cheering crowds who lined the streets. US experts have said it does seem as though North Korea is just two or three tests away from being combat-ready."

""I do not do this lightly as I love King's but believe the Government and regulator are unrealistic about the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and the Trust,"" he said. ""I want to pay tribute to the staff and their excellent patient care."" In a self-penned article in the Guardian, he went on to pay tribute to the ""world-class"" care given at the hospital, especially after the Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks. ""King's, like many other hospitals, is fighting against the inexorable pressures of rising demand, increasing costs of drugs and other medical supplies, and the tightest spending figures in recent times,"" he wrote. ""There are undoubtedly things that I and the trust could have done better, there always are, but fundamentally our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised. ""We desperately need a fundamental rethink. Until then we are simply 'kicking the can down the road'."" The hospital described Lord Kerslake as a ""passionate advocate and champion"" of the trust. ""With a heartfelt commitment to staff and patients, he has led King's through a challenging period which has also seen some notable successes, our response to three major incidents in London, the launch of the helipad and delivering some of the highest patient outcomes of any Trust in the UK,"" a statement added. But NHS Improvement branded the hospital's financial performance ""unacceptable"", adding: ""It is the worst in the NHS and continues to deteriorate."" Lord Kerslake is a member of the House of Lords, president of the Local Government Association and former head of the civil service and permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Lord Kerslake's decision was ""embarrassing for the Government"" and that ""seven years of underfunding is impacting on patients in unacceptable ways"". A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""We know that King's NHS Foundation Trust faces huge financial challenges and we will support them to tackle these issues and continue to deliver high quality care for patients under a new chairman. ""We would like to thank Lord Kerslake for his service."""

According to the most recent figures, released in 2012 by the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command (CEOP), 100% of child sex offenders in paedophile rings were white. The report says CEOP, an official government body, identifies two types of group-based child sexual exploitation offenders. Type 1 offenders were those that targeted their victims based on their vulnerability (roughly equivalent of grooming gangs), whereas Type 2 offenders target children as a result of a specific sexual interest in children (roughly equivalent of paedophile rings). CEOP found that 75% of Type 1 offenders were of Asian ethnicity, whereas 100% of Type 2 offenders were white. In a number of cities across the UK, gangs of predominantly British Pakistani men have been convicted for targeting vulnerable white young women and girls. Questions have been raised about the connections between ethnicity and the offenders, and two British-Pakistani researchers from the Quilliam Foundation have said that the link is important. The Foundation, a think-tank which usually focuses on extremism, has chosen to add its voice to the debate with what it describes as an evidence-based view. Quilliam's researchers found 264 people have been convicted for the specific crime of gang grooming since 2005, and of those offenders 222 or 84% were Asian. The report's co-author, Haras Rafiq, spoke to Sky News from his home in Rochdale, one town where members of a sex ring of predominantly British-Pakistani men were jailed for child sexual abuse in 2012. ""I'm from the heart of where one of the biggest high profile cases have happened over the last few years, and I'm saying it's very important that we do talk about it because the problem won't go away,"" he said. ""We didn't want there to be a pattern of people from our ethnic demographic carrying out these attacks. But unfortunately we were proven wrong."" High profile cases like Rochdale have generated negative headlines about the Asian community. The most recent case in Newcastle changed the debate after 17 men and one woman were convicted of nearly 100 offences, and the judge said the grooming wasn't racially motivated. Following the judgment, Mike Penning MP wrote to the Attorney General calling for a review. Nazir Afzal, who is credited with tackling the issue during his time as Chief Crown Prosecutor in the North West, warned the issue of 'Asian' grooming gangs is being used as a recruitment tool by the far-right. Mr Afzal also warned gang grooming was not the most common form of child sexual abuse. ""British white men they tend to work individually. They tend to work online where they groom and they are the majority of perpetrators. When it comes to Asian men or Pakistani men they tend to do it in groups,"" Mr Afzal said."

If there's no deal, then we get full alignment. The idea that a deal would then see low alignment seems unlikely. But ministerial sources are adamant this is a red herring. They say Britain will enjoy full regulatory independence, there will be outcome equivalence but autonomy on reaching those outcomes, and the terms of Friday's deal on the Irish border are just a contingency. Longstanding Brexiteers would have preferred the word ""equivalence"" in Friday's agreement, and some trust has been lost by the fact this was not cleared in advance by the Cabinet sub-committee. They are still concerned and this will now be thrashed out in Cabinet as early as next week. The big winners here are the business community, who forced Number 10 to do whatever it takes to achieve a quickly agreed transition deal. That is why quick compromises were made by Mrs May. The second phase of negotiations will be even harder. A fudge only goes so far. It is an achievement for the Prime Minister to have got here. It is a significant achievement to have got the Cabinet and the DUP to sign up to this. But the real victory would be to get all her MPs on side. It is unclear if that is the case."

They were part of a larger group all understood to have taken the drug, but the two teenagers died in hospital shortly after. Aaron Reilly's family described him as a responsible young man who made ""one silly mistake"". ""Aaron was a much loved son, brother, grandson and boyfriend. He loved to skate, play computer games. Like most teenage lads he liked a night out with his friends and was respected by them as a non-drug user,"" they said. Relatives of Joshua Brock said what happened that night was ""so totally out of character as he was always against drug taking in any shape or form"". ""One moment of madness led to this tragedy,"" the family statement added. An 18-year-old man who was arrested in connection with the incident has been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

""Keith died peacefully at home shortly after midnight on 11 December. ""His wife Maria, his daughter Rose and his son Ted were by his side. ""We would like to take this opportunity to thank Severn Hospice for the kindness, support and care they have shown us all over the last few weeks. ""Keith was a loving husband, father, son, brother, uncle and friend. We would respectfully ask to be left to mourn his passing in private."" Starring in shows such as Cheggers Plays Pop, Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, and Saturday Superstore, he rapidly became a household name, and his death has prompted an outpouring of grief from celebrities and fans alike. His first wife, TV presenter Maggie Philbin, said she was ""heartbroken"" and he was ""still attempting to be life and soul of the party despite being on portable oxygen"" during his sister's wedding two months ago. She revealed he was surrounded by ""so much love"" from his second wife Maria, their son, his sister, twin brother Jeff and his father, Colin, and his daughter who flew over from San Francisco. Radio DJ Tony Blackburn told Sky News he will miss Chegwin's childish sense of humour. Fellow broadcaster Noel Edmonds, his Swap Shop co-presenter, said in a statement: ""I've lost my first real telly chum and I'm certain I'm not alone in shedding tears for a true telly legend. ""He was an extraordinary showman capable of entertaining a vast crowd of excited children during the long periods between his live contributions to the show."" John Craven, who appeared on Swap Shop and Saturday Superstore with Chegwin, said he first met him when he was 19. He said: ""I never saw Keith without a smile. He was always bubbly, positive, full of fun."" Still not right. I will be back - But not for a bit yet. I’m so sorry Chegwin started out his career as an actor after being spotted by Phil Collins' mother, June Collins, as a child. He appeared in several children's TV shows and ads, including for Pepsi and Cadbury Creme Eggs. He also appeared in Roman Polanski's Macbeth, playing Banquo's son. I’m absolutely devastated to hear that my friend Keith Chegwin has died.He was one of the nicest people I have ever known and over the years we did shows together and became great friends. Keith RIP. Very sad to hear about the death of Keith Chegwin. A kind, funny, brave man who seized the day. Such sad news. Very much a part of my childhood. RIP Keith Chegwin. pic.twitter.com/IFL7TujE9b In the mid 1970s he moved away from acting and became a household name as he presented programmes such as Multi-Coloured Swap Shop and Cheggers Plays Pop. In the 1980s, he presented Saturday Superstore. He and Swap Shop co-presenters Noel Edmonds and his first wife released the pop single, I Wanna Be a Winner, which reached number one in 1982. During the late 1980s and 1990s his career petered off due to alcoholism, which he detailed in semi-autobiographical book Shaken But Not Stirred. Following an appearance on This Morning in 1992, he stopped drinking and managed to reboot his career. He joined The Big Breakfast in 1993 when he presented Down Your Doorstep in which he cried: ""Wake up you beggars, it's Cheggers!"". Soon after, he went on to present the show. Chegwin also presented a revived version of the 1970s gameshow It's A Knockout on Channel 5. However, not all of his shows were a success. Wearing just a hat, Chegwin presented the nudist game show Naked Jungle, which he would later admit was ""the worst career move"" in his life. He was also a mainstay on GMTV, appearing on the breakfast programme for seven years from 2000. In 2012 Chegwin was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the National Reality TV Awards. Chegwin's final appearance on TV was on Celebrity Big Brother in 2015, followed by Celebrity Masterchef in the same year. He did not have a manager or an agent and anybody could email him. Over the past 50 years, Chegwin appeared in numerous pantomimes, with his last, Beauty And The Beast, in March 2016."

The problem of people being pushed towards ""completely legal but totally inappropriate"" investments which fall short of fraud needed to be tackled, it added. Members of the committee said the combination of high financial value and low saver engagement had made pensions a scammer's ""perfect storm"". They had heard examples of investments such as diamonds, overseas property developments, forestry and film. The committee welcomed a commitment by the Government to ban pensions cold-calling, but said the draft legislation was flawed because it tied outlawing of calls to the creation of a new financial guidance body - meaning it might not happen until 2020. The cross-party panel of MPs said a change to the bill would see an enforceable ban introduced by June 2018. It has called on the Government to take ""urgent action"" through the Financial Guidance and Claims Bill, recently unveiled by ministers, ""to legislate to protect pensions now"". Chairman Frank Field said that with ""every day that passes without a ban"" pensions were ""rich pickings"" for scammers offering over-the-top returns or seemingly clever advice. ""There is no need to over-complicate this: our proposal would see an enforceable ban in place by summer, closing at least one door on rafts of scammers at a stroke."" He added: ""Making guidance the default option combined with the ban on cold-calling would be a simple but big step forward in consumer protection in the era of pension freedoms."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We take the threat of pension scams very seriously and we're already protecting savers. ""We're bringing forward legislation to ban pensions cold-calling, tightening HMRC rules to stop pensions scammers and fraudulent schemes, and preventing the transfer of money from occupational pension schemes into fraudulent ones."""

Several national newspapers are reporting that Mourinho was covered outside the Old Trafford changing rooms after telling City players to turn down their music. Police officers and stewards had to separate 20 players and staff, The Guardian reports. Bottles and punches are said to have been thrown. City coach Mikel Arteta was reportedly left bleeding from his face from the melee. The Football Association has asked both clubs for their observations about the incident. Pep Guardiola's side moved 11 points clear of second-placed United with the victory. Mourinho showed no signs of having been soaked when he emerged for his post-match interview with Sky Sports - but it was clear he had not taken the defeat well. ""I think they are a very good team, I think they are lucky, I think (they) have all the decisions in their favour, probably yes,"" he said. The fracas will prompt comparisons with the infamous ""Battle of the Buffet"" at the same ground when former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was hit by pizza after his side beat Arsenal 2-0 in 2004."

He was discovered in the early hours of Monday last week. Marie Brown, 41, had also been killed. Detectives believe she may have walked in on her father's killers as they chopped up his body. A post-mortem examination showed Mr Brown was killed by ""neck compression"", and his daughter had suffered similar injuries. Detective Inspector Helen Rance said Mr Brown is thought to have died between November 30 and December 4. His daughter, a creche worker, is believed to have died between 2 December and 4 December. Mr Brown was jailed in 1999 for a sex offence. He was released in 2004 and police say there are no indications of any further offences that could be suspected as a motive for murder. Police want to speak to two men who visited Mr Brown's flat in the days before he died. Officers have also said there is no evidence he was targeted after a big gambling win, nothing to indicate a break-in at his flat and no evidence of a struggle or that he had been restrained. The inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court has been suspended for the murder investigation to continue."

However, new satellite data by British Antarctic Survey (BAS) shows Mount Hope is the tallest mountain, at 3,239m (10,654ft). The new data reveals Mount Hope as being 55m taller than Mount Jackson and 377m higher than previously thought. The discovery was made during work by BAS to update planning maps for pilots operating in Antarctica. New high-resolution satellite measurements, accurate to within 5 metres, show there are several errors in the old overland surveys. Adrian Fox, head of mapping and geographic information at BAS, said: ""This is an exciting discovery within the British Antarctic Territory. ""Modern satellite data highlights how inaccurate previous surveys and maps were for some parts of the region. ""Maps with reliable measurements of the highest peaks are an essential safety requirement for flight planning. Accurate elevation data from satellite imagery now allows us to produce these resources for Antarctica, where flying is difficult at the best of times."" Foreign Office Minister with responsibility for the Polar Regions, Sir Alan Duncan, said: ""The discovery of Mount Hope as the UK's tallest peak is a great example of British science making big steps forward in mapping techniques to help us get a better understanding of this fascinating region."" Mount Hope is the highest mountain in the British Antarctic Territory, however, Mount Vinson remains the highest mountain in Antarctica at 4,892m (16,050ft)."
2017-12-11,"The Forties pipeline, which carries 40% of North Sea oil and gas, is to be shut down to repair a crack in the pipe, operator Ineos said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171212032225/https://news.sky.com/story/major-oil-and-gas-pipeline-to-be-shut-down-to-fix-crack-11166856,"Ineos said a small hairline crack was found last week during a routine inspection south of Aberdeen. A cordon was set up and residents placed in temporary accommodation while the pipeline pressure was reduced and a full assessment made. Ineos said in a statement: ""Despite reducing the pressure the crack has extended, and as a consequence the incident management team has now decided that a controlled shutdown of the pipeline is the safest way to proceed. ""This will allow for a suitable repair method to be worked up based on the latest inspection data, while reducing the risk of injury to staff and the environment. ""As always, safety remains our top priority and local residents, Forties Pipeline System users and other stakeholders are all being kept fully informed of the situation as it develops."" Ineos said that up to now, no oil or gas seepage had been detected and that the pipe was being closely monitored. The crack in the three-foot wide pipe has widened to 155mm (6 inches), the company said. Ineos director Tom Crotty told the Press Association that the work would probably take a ""couple of weeks"" but he did not believe there would be any impact on the public. Additional oil and gas will instead be shipped in from overseas. Ineos bought the pipeline system from BP earlier this year in a deal worth up to $250m. The 235-mile pipeline transports oil extracted from thousands of feet beneath the seabed 105 miles to the Cruden Bay terminal, near Peterhead, and then a further 129 miles to Kinneil processing plant next to the refinery and petrochemicals complex at Grangemouth."
2017-12-11,The Government is scrambling to avoid a defeat on key Brexit legislation just hours before the Prime Minister travels to an EU summit on Thursday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171212032225/https://news.sky.com/story/government-scrambles-to-avoid-defeat-on-eu-withdrawal-bill-11167330,"The EU Withdrawal Bill will return to the House of Commons on Tuesday and Wednesday, before which Number 10 announced it was accepting a cross-party amendment on so-called Henry VIII powers. A ""sifting"" committee will now scrutinise those executive powers required to correct the UK's post-Brexit statute book. But it is amendment seven, calling for a ""meaningful vote"" on the Brexit deal, that is causing the Government the most trouble. Tabled by senior Tory backbencher Dominic Grieve, and publicly signed by 10 Conservative MPs, it is set to be put to a vote on Wednesday night. Ministers have been consulting with Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, as to how to address his concerns. One Tory MP, recently accused of being a Brexit ""mutineer"", said: ""Unless the Government accepts it or gives some cast iron guarantee in effect to replicate it - we will push it to a vote."" The Government conceded the broad principle of putting the UK's exit deal into law in the Commons last month. :: PM: £40bn Brexit offer 'off table' without deal The Withdrawal Agreement Implementation Bill (WAIB) will incorporate the finalised financial settlement, the citizens' rights deal, Irish border compromise and transition arrangements into British legislation. But Mr Grieve has refused to withdraw his amendment, as it guarantees the WAIB would have to be passed as a pre-requisite for the Prime Minister signing off on the Brexit deal. This would accord the UK Parliament the same sanctioning power as the European Parliament. Potential Tory rebels have also been promised the issue will be dealt with in the report stage of the EU Withdrawal Bill, due in the New Year. But the group of MPs feels that promises made to them during the passage of the Article 50 Bill were not kept. Sky News also understands that one provision of the Government's WAIB could effectively temporarily reapply the provisions of the 1972 European Communities Act for a transition period. Therefore it would unrepeal its repeal in the EU Withdrawal Bill. This would allow some temporary continuance of EU law and jurisdiction during an implementation phase of ""around two years"", as provisionally agreed by the Prime Minister last week. A significant number of Tory MPs are also unimpressed with the Government's own ""exit date"" amendment, and have told party whips that they do not back the largely symbolic measure to write the Brexit date of 29 March, 2019, into law. So far, however, the Government has defeated all amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, with help from its Brexit-backing DUP partners. Ahead of the bill's return to Parliament on Tuesday, First Secretary of State Damian Green will host ministers from the devolved administrations at a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Council. Brexit Secretary David Davis will also be present for the meeting with Scottish and Welsh Governments and a representative of Northern Ireland's civil service. Legislative consent from these administrations will be required for some aspects of Brexit legislation."
2017-12-11,Michael Gove is attempting to repair the Government's relations with animal welfare campaigners by unveiling much longer jail terms for cruelty.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171212032225/https://news.sky.com/story/government-draft-tougher-animal-cruelty-laws-after-sentience-row-11167159,"The Environment Secretary and leading Cabinet Brexiteer is publishing draft legislation on animal welfare to come into force when the UK leaves the EU. The move comes just weeks after the Conservatives faced a furious backlash for voting against moves to adopt EU laws recognising that animals feel pain and emotions. A furore erupted after the Government rejected an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill from Green MP Caroline Lucas, which would have transposed part of the Lisbon Treaty into UK law recognising that animals are sentient lifeforms. Mr Gove has been forced to act after social media campaigns by 38 Degrees, Compassion in World Farming and other groups targeted Conservative MPs, calling on them to reverse their vote against recognising animal sentience. As a result, the Environment Secretary is now publishing a draft bill which proposes increasing the maximum prison sentence for animal cruelty tenfold, from six months to five years, in England and Wales. The bill also proposes ministers ""must have regard to the welfare needs of animals as sentient beings in formulating and implementing Government policy"". Unveiling his plans after visiting Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, Mr Gove claimed: ""As we leave the EU we will deliver a Green Brexit, not only maintaining but enhancing animal welfare standards. ""Animals are sentient beings who feel pain and suffering, so we are writing that principle into law and ensuring that we protect their welfare. ""Our plans will also increase sentences for those who commit the most heinous acts of animal cruelty to five years in jail. ""We are a nation of animal lovers so we will make Brexit work not just for citizens but for the animals we love and cherish too."" The plans to increase maximum sentences follows cases where courts have said they would have handed down longer sentences had they been available. In one case last year, a man trained dogs to torture other animals, including trapping a fox and a terrier dog in a cage to brutally attack each other. Others included: :: A man who systematically abused and killed several puppies by beating, choking and stabbing them, sentenced to the maximum six months' imprisonment and banned from owning animals; :: A man who kicked his girlfriend's dog to death was given a custodial sentence of just over five months, fined £1,000 and banned from owning animals; :: A man who fed his dog aspirin and paracetamol to try to kill her before beating her to death with a shovel was sentenced to four months in prison and banned from owning animals. On average, about 1,150 people per year are convicted for animal cruelty, but fewer than five of them receive the current maximum sentence. Under the Government's plans, courts will retain the ability to hand out an unlimited fine and ban an offender from owning animals in the future. The proposed legislation will also bring maximum sentences for animal cruelty in England into line with other countries such as Australia, Canada and the Republic of Ireland. Welcoming Mr Gove's proposals, Battersea Dogs & Cats Home's chief executive Claire Horton said: ""Battersea is greatly encouraged by the Government's willingness to see sentences for the most shocking cases of animal cruelty increase from six months to five years. ""Today's announcement takes a significant step in that direction."""

It also includes an intention for Qatar to buy further military equipment from Britain, namely Hawk aircraft. About 5,000 workers in the UK are employed on building the Typhoon, mainly at Warton in Lancashire. The company said the deal would not mean a reversal of the planned job cuts across its operations in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Portsmouth, Guildford and overseas during the next three years. ""We have around 5,000 UK employees manufacturing and supporting these brilliant aircraft, as well as many hundreds of companies in the supply chain. Securing this contract enables us to safeguard Typhoon production well into the next decade,"" BAE Systems said. ""The difficult decisions we have taken are necessary to better balance our workforce with our workload and ensure we have a sustainable and competitive business for the long term. We don't take these decisions lightly - and as you'd expect we did take this potential order into account when reviewing our production needs for the future."" The deal was signed by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and his Qatari counterpart Khalid bin Mohammed al Attiyah. A statement from Qatar's armed forces said the two ministers also signed an ""agreement for building up a Joint Operational Squadron"" between the two countries' air forces to provide security during the 2022 football World Cup, which the Gulf state is hosting. Mr Williamson said the contract was the biggest export agreement for the Typhoon in a decade and would ""boost the Qatari military's mission to tackle the challenges we both share in the Middle East"". He added: ""As we proudly fly the flag for our world-leading aerospace sector all over the globe this news is a massive vote of confidence, supporting thousands of British jobs and injecting billions into our economy."" Charles Woodburn, BAE Systems chief executive, said: ""We are delighted to begin a new chapter in the development of a long-term relationship with the State of Qatar and the Qatar armed forces, and we look forward to working alongside our customer as they continue to develop their military capability. ""This agreement is a strong endorsement of Typhoon's leading capabilities and underlines BAE Systems' long track record of working in successful partnership with our customers."" Qatar is the ninth country to sign a deal for Typhoon jets, with delivery expected to commence in late 2022. The announcement comes as the Government searches for major global trade deals amid Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. Last week Prime Minister Theresa May struck a deal with Brussels after the first phase of Brexit negotiations, in the hope of talks progressing on to trade."

I will really miss mucking around with him. I spoke to him only four or five weeks ago. He left a message on Twitter saying he wouldn't be doing it for some time, so I rang him up and said: ""What's the problem?"" He said: ""I've been very unwell and I didn't want to bother people."" He said he had a problem with his lungs. I didn't realise it was so bad, and he said he was recovering and would be better soon. I didn't want to bother him and was going to get him in touch when he was better, but that never happened. I found out he had died from a friend at BBC Berkshire. I just couldn't believe it - my wife and I were writing his Christmas card last night. We used to write stupid Christmas cards to each other. Just being with Cheggers was great fun. We worked together on Radio One, we did the children's shows together with his first wife Maggie, then Keith would go off and do Swap Shop. :: TV presenter Keith Chegwin dies aged 60 I was touring around with him for ITV, we did a lot together for the breakfast show. We were called the Clues Brothers, we were just all over the place, he was terrific, I absolutely adored him. There wasn't a nasty bone in his body, he was great fun to be with. I've got a lot of energy but he's got more. We used to wear the crew out. He had a lovely childish sense of humour and he was exactly the same person on TV as off. We were very similar as we have a lot of energy and found it difficult to sleep. When we were filming abroad we'd sit up late at night, chatting for hours. Although he was 14 years younger than me I didn't ever notice the age gap, he was just tremendous to be with. Sixty is definitely too young to go. Cheggers was very honest. I invited him to our wedding and I didn't realise he was having drink problems. I was working with him, and had no idea, you couldn't tell at all. He said he wasn't able to come to our wedding, then somebody told me he was in recovery so I rang him. He just said he didn't want to bother me, he was a very considerate man, a real family man, he really loved his wife. I was surprised when he told me he'd been ill and had a serious lung condition. He did used to smoke a lot, even at the airport, he'd have to go and smoke in those little areas. On the airplane he used to suck on this stick which gave him nicotine. He'd be very flattered with all the tributes. I don't know anybody who had a bad word to say about him. In the studio he'd treat the cameramen, runners the same. I've seen people be not very nice, but never him."

2017-12-11,"I remember when I was really young, watching Sir David Attenborough with my Uncle Hesham who often looked after me.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171212032225/https://news.sky.com/story/my-uncle-died-alone-in-his-flat-in-grenfell-tower-11166028,":: Grenfell Tower fire - First stage of public inquiry due to begin I remember him teaching me how to write and read Arabic and always stuffing my pockets with chocolates and sweets. I remember playing in Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk when I was younger with my friends; playing games like ""knock down ginger"" those were the good old days. I remember when my uncle first got his flat in the top floor of Grenfell Tower sometime in 2013 and how happy he was. I remember him being excited about how he was going to decorate and put together his new home. He liked the fact he lived on the top floor, he said he was ""closer to God"" and that also made him happy. He could see the Westway football pitches from his flat where I regularly played and he would sometimes watch me and message me after playing making fun of how rubbish I was. My uncle Hesham was a very funny man with a huge heart and was described by his friends as a kind and generous man. In the early hours of 14 June this year I was woken up by my wife screaming ""Grenfell Tower is on fire, call Uncle Hesham."" My uncle's phone kept ringing with no answer. My grandmother heard from him last at around 3am. Later we learned he didn't make it out of the tower. He had trouble walking and often used a walking stick so would have struggled to make it down the stairs from the top floor. He tragically died alone in his flat and many others perished that night in the tower. He was identified on 25 August and finally laid to rest on 30 September. The Grenfell Tower fire has broken the hearts of our close community but above all it has united us in the fight for justice, to make sure that a tragedy of this scale will never happen again. I know it is going to be a long journey and it may uncover some ugly and uncomfortable truths but it's important we don't give up. The more we learn about the circumstances surrounding the Grenfell Tower fire and its refurbishment the angrier we all get. This could have been avoided if the concerns of the residents were taken seriously and weren't ignored. Our anger has now turned into determination to fight for justice. Perhaps that horrific night would have not happened if our Government learned lessons from previous fires and implemented recommendations from their inquiries. There are so many things that went wrong and collectively, directly and indirectly contributed to the Grenfell Tower fire. We know that the public inquiry will be a very complex process, and myself and others believe that it should not be left to one person. This is why we have asked the Prime Minister to appoint a panel to sit alongside the judge and will have the same powers as him to report back to her. We have been corresponding with Theresa May since August this year requesting this panel, and still until now she has not made a decision. We feel ignored and our concerns are not being listened to - that is why the bereaved, survivors, community and with the help and support of Grenfell United have all come together in the hope that collectively are voices will be heard. We have started a petition calling on the PM to listen to our concerns and we want a fair public inquiry that will get to the truth and make the right recommendations which our Government will implement this time!"
2017-12-11,The government agency in charge of improving the NHS has placed the King's College Hospitals trust in special measures.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171212032225/https://news.sky.com/story/kings-college-hospitals-in-special-measures-11166678,"Earlier, Sky News revealed that the new chair of regulator NHS Improvement asked the chairman of one of the UK's biggest NHS trusts, Lord Kerslake, to resign. Overnight on Sunday, Lord Kerslake announced he was stepping down as chairman of King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London in protest. He said he was resigning over what he claimed was the Government's ""unrealistic"" approach to the huge challenges around funding. NHS Improvement said it has placed the trust in special measures following serious concerns about its growing deficit. Ian Dalton, Chief Executive of NHS Improvement said: ""The financial situation at King's has deteriorated very seriously over recent months and we have now placed the trust in special measures to maximise the amount of scrutiny and support that it receives. ""We understand that the wider NHS faces financial and operational challenges, and other trusts and foundation trusts have large deficits. However, none has shown the sheer scale and pace of the deterioration at King's. ""It is not acceptable for individual organisations to run up such significant deficits when the majority of the sector is working extremely hard to hit their financial plans, and in many cases have made real progress."" NHS Improvement said it had agreed with the King's board earlier this year a budget deficit of £38m for 2017/18. In late October, the body said, the trust formally worsened this prediction to £70m, and last week re-forecast an end-year deficit of £92m. ""As an organisation, King's own prediction for its deficit has worsened by £54m, and more than doubled, within months,"" a statement said. Lord Kerlake said in a statement released on Sunday night: ""I do not do this lightly as I love King's but believe the Government and regulator are unrealistic about the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and the trust. ""I want to pay tribute to the staff and their excellent patient care."" He went on to pay tribute to the ""world-class"" care given at the hospital, especially after the Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks. In a self-penned article in Monday's Guardian newspaper, he wrote: ""King's, like many other hospitals, is fighting against the inexorable pressures of rising demand, increasing costs of drugs and other medical supplies, and the tightest spending figures in recent times,"" he added. ""There are undoubtedly things that I and the trust could have done better, there always are, but fundamentally our problems lie in the way that the NHS is funded and organised. ""We desperately need a fundamental rethink. Until then we are simply 'kicking the can down the road'."" The peer, also known as Bob Kerslake, was made Head of the Home Civil Service, after the Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell stood down on 31 December 2011. He was also Permanent Secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government before taking up the role of Chair of King's College Hospitals in June 2015, having been made a crossbench life peer in March. Two months ago, Lord Kerslake was appointed to a role advising Jeremy Corbyn and his team on ""what to expect in government"", describing the Labour leader's ideas as ""not unusual"". Lord Kerslake insisted that his decision to speak out was motivated by a ""deep passion for the NHS"" and was""nothing to do with party politics"". Earlier, NHS Improvement branded the hospital's financial performance ""unacceptable"", adding: ""It is the worst in the NHS and continues to deteriorate."" Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Lord Kerslake's decision was ""embarrassing for the Government"" and that ""seven years of underfunding is impacting on patients in unacceptable ways"". A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""We know that King's NHS Foundation Trust faces huge financial challenges and we will support them to tackle these issues and continue to deliver high quality care for patients under a new chairman."
2017-12-11,Philip Hammond has risked a new row between Theresa May and Donald Trump by attacking the President's planned tax cuts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171212032225/https://news.sky.com/story/chancellor-philip-hammond-attacks-donald-trumps-tax-cuts-11167263,"In a highly-provocative move, the Chancellor has teamed up with four other European finance ministers to claim US tax cuts could start a trade war. Along with his counterparts in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, Mr Hammond has put his name to a hard-hitting letter to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. In the letter, which runs to three pages, the five European ministers express their ""significant concerns"" about the President's tax changes ""having a major distortive impact on international trade"". They also claim Mr Trump's proposed changes could contravene World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and America's own tax guidelines. Mr Hammond's decision to sign the letter will be seen as hugely controversial, since it risks angering the President at a time when the UK is trying to strengthen its post-Brexit trade links with the US. The fact that the pro-Remain Chancellor has joined forces with colleagues from leading EU countries to attack tax cuts is also likely to infuriate right-wing Eurosceptic Tory MPs who already want him sacked. The move also comes only days after the Prime Minister clashed with Mr Trump over the President's bitterly controversial decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And it follows disagreements on the President's policy on climate change, immigration and decision to promote UK far-right group Britain First, all of which have led to plans for a state visit to the UK by Mr Trump being postponed indefinitely. The finance ministers signing the letter are from Europe's five largest economies. They claim the tax cut plans would flout international agreements and undermine trade, threatening to turn a Washington policy battle into a transatlantic row. In their letter, the ministers - Peter Altmaier of Germany, Bruno Le Maire of France, Pier Carlo Padoan of Italy, Cristóbal Montoro of Spain and Mr Hammond - raise the possibility of Europe retaliating if the President's proposed tax cut legislation becomes law. Although Mr Hammond's involvement in the letter will be controversial, Sky News understands that it was cleared by both 10 Downing Street and the Foreign Office. The finance ministers write: ""While the establishment of a modern, competitive and robust tax system is one of the essential pillars of a state's sovereignty, it is important that the US government's rights over domestic tax policy be exercised in a way that adheres with international obligations to which it has signed up,"" the ministers said. ""The inclusion of certain less conventional international tax provisions could contravene the US's double taxation treaties and may risk having a major distortive impact on international trade."" The letter highlights concerns in Europe that the Trump administration will use tax reform as a route to promote ""America first"" trade discrimination, escalating tensions that have already risen in other policy areas like the environment and Middle East peace. The ministers insisted they were not seeking to intervene in a domestic tax debate, which they called one of ""the essential pillars of a state's sovereignty"". But they warn Mr Mnuchin that Washington should not start a trade dispute under the guise of anti-avoidance measures in taxation. ""We have strong concerns if [US action to protect its tax base] is done via measures that are not targeted on abusive arrangements as this would impact on genuine business activities,"" they wrote. In addition to Mr Mnuchin, the letter was sent to Gary Cohn, the top White House economic adviser, along with heads of congressional committees currently locked in negotiations over the tax bill passed by the Senate and House of Representatives. Responding to the letter, a US Treasury spokesman said: ""We appreciate the views of the finance ministers. We are closely working with Congress as they finalise the legislation."" On Sunday, Mr Trump posted on Twitter: ""Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important, but SPECIAL!"""
2017-12-11,A man with a pipe bomb strapped to his chest caused chaos in New York after the device went off in a crowded subway tunnel near Times Square.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171212032225/https://news.sky.com/story/new-york-bombing-in-subway-tunnel-inspired-by-islamic-state-11167070,"The bomb exploded during morning rush-hour, at around 7.30am US time, in a busy passageway linking two subways underneath Port Authority terminal - the nation's largest bus hub. Police believe that the bomb - described by police as a ""low-tech device"" - went off prematurely between Seventh and Eighth Avenues on 42nd Street and could have been intended for a busier destination. Armed police and fire crews reacted in force, with all trains from 42nd Street diverted and roads closed to traffic. The suspect has been named as Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi man who is believed to have lived in the US for seven years, and was reportedly based in Brooklyn. He has been arrested and is now in hospital with non-life threatening burns to his abdomen and hands. Police, who have labelled it an attempted terror attack, say Ullah was inspired by the Islamic State, but had apparently not had any direct contact with the terror group. :: Analysis - NY bombing is reminder of daily threat to cities Officers say the crude explosive device was attached to his body with Velcro and cable ties. Surveillance footage captured the moment the bomb went off in the tunnel, showing a man being blown to the floor. Commuters can be seen covering their heads and running from the scene, as the passage fills with smoke. A photo taken shortly after the explosion shows a bearded man on the ground, with his hands in cuffs behind his back. His clothes appear to have been ripped by the force of the explosion and his midriff looks burnt and covered in soot. People on the scene described ""chaos"" underground following the explosion, and a ""stampede"" as people ran from the station. Three other people were injured in the blast and are now in hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Security has been stepped up at transport hubs following the bombing, which comes two months after eight died in a New York City terror attack carried out ""in the name of IS""  New York Mayor Bill De Blasio said: ""This is the most resilient place on earth, we proved it just over a month ago, we proved it on 9/11. The terrorists will not win, let's get back to work."" Later, Donald Trump said the bombing proved the US must ""fix its lax immigration system"". The US President added: ""Today's terror suspect entered out country through extended family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security. ""My executive action to restrict the entry of certain nationals from eight countries...is just one step forward in securing our immigration system. ""Congress must end chain migration."""

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley made the announcement which was followed by a speech by Mr Trump. He was joined by one of the first men to land on the Moon, Buzz Aldrin, and Harrison Schmitt, known as ""Jack"", who is the last living crew member of the Apollo 17 mission, which landed in 1972. At the White House, Mr Trump said: ""Forty-five years ago, almost to the minute, Jack became one of the last Americans to land on the Moon. ""Today we pledge that he will not be the last, and I suspect we will be finding some other places to land other than the Moon. ""The directive I am signing today will refocus the space programme on human exploration and discovery. ""It is an important step in returning American astronauts to the Moon, for the first time since 1972 for long time exploration and use. ""This time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint, we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars and perhaps someday to many worlds beyond."" He said the mission would inspire others and showed NASA would keep the pioneer spirit alive. He added: ""Today the same spirit beckons us to begin new journeys of exploration and discovery, to lift our eyes all the way up to the heavens and imagine the possibilities waiting in those big beautiful stars if we dream big. ""This is a giant step towards that inspiring future and reclaiming America's proud destination in space."" Mr Trump said America was the leader and would remain the leader. Vice President Mike Pence added that the directive would secure new jobs and would mean space exploration was led with American rules and values. Mr Schmitt was the first scientist-astronaut to land on the Moon in the December 1972 mission."

Scotsman Mr Alexander has already tried twice during the last year to snare Ladbrokes Coral. He is clearly hoping that this will be a case of third time lucky. What is unusual about the timing of today's announcement is that, while GVC had always been expected to have another tilt at Ladbrokes, the assumption was that it would wait until the Government had completed its review of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) - the lucrative but highly controversial gaming machines that sit in every high street bookmaker. :: Ladbrokes Coral in talks on takeover by GVC The review is likely to impose a lower maximum stake per spin on the machines which, depending on how low the figure is, is likely to take a chunk out of the profits of bookmakers. Accordingly, GVC could have been forgiven for waiting a while to see what the Department for Culture, Media and Sport came up with, not least because confusion over the issue has clouded previous negotiations over how to value Ladbrokes. GVC's solution has been to come up with a clever formula under which the eventual sum it pays will depend on the outcome of the review and values Ladbrokes at anywhere between £3.1bn and £3.9bn. The combined business is expected to be worth some £5.7bn and would qualify for membership of the FTSE 100. Yet only as recently as September, Mr Alexander - who has taken GVC from being an Aim-listed minnow to a £2.75bn member of the FTSE 250 in a decade - was insisting he would ""definitely...not be doing anything before the outcome of the review"". What will startle casual observers is the way in which GVC, a 13-year old business few outside the City will have heard of, is in a position to snaffle an established company boasting two of the best-known names in the industry. Joe Coral, after all, launched his bookmaking business 91 years ago while Ladbrokes dates back even further, to 1886. That reflects dramatic changes in the gaming industry, in particular the explosive growth of online betting, but also the rapid growth of GVC itself via a series of mergers and acquisitions. Founded in 2004, as Luxembourg-based Gaming VC Holdings, its meteoric growth began when, in March 2007, Kilmarnock-supporting Mr Alexander - who will head the combined GVC and Ladbrokes - became chief executive. After a string of smaller deals, the first big one came when, in 2013, GVC teamed up with William Hill to buy the online sports betting business Sportingbet. Then, in 2015, it outbid rival 888 Holdings to pay £1.1bn for Bwin.Party, a fallen star of the gaming sector formed from the merger of the former Real Madrid shirt sponsor Bwin and the former FTSE 100 member PartyGaming. This was the boldest roll of the dice yet for Mr Alexander as, at the time, Bwin.Party was more than twice the size of GVC. Again, as with Sportingbet, he and his colleagues proved adept at successfully integrating another business. But Ladbrokes Coral, even at the lower end of the price range being mooted, is a much bigger beast than anything GVC has previously taken on and, like Bwin.Party, it is larger than GVC itself. Moreover, unlike Sportingbet and Bwin.Party, it is not a purely digital business but one boasting physical assets in the form of 3,700 high street betting shops. Mr Alexander has, in the recent past, made clear his preference for acquiring online gaming businesses ahead of ones owning bookmaking shops because the former tend to be more highly valued by investors than the latter. By contrast, he was today talking about how the ""enlarged group would be an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business that would benefit from a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy"". Aside from Mr Alexander's apparent conversion to the joys of high street betting shops, this deal raises several questions. One is whether this deal fires the starting pistol on another round of consolidation in the betting industry. Betfair has already joined forces with Paddy Power but the likes of 888 Holdings, William Hill, Jackpotjoy and Canadian firm Stars Group, owner of the PokerStars website, are all expected to participate in further tie-ups.

The unbeaten 29-year-old has not fought since ending Wladimir Klitschko's reign as world heavyweight champion two years ago. A renewed licence is now in the hands of the BBBofC, whose general secretary Robert Smith told Sky Sports last month: ""It is publicly known that Mr Fury has a number of health issues and we would have to look at that."" Fury has already shed three stone of weight, according to Ricky Hatton who welcomed the heavyweight into his gym recently, and he is eyeing prospective opponents for his comeback.

It is the first object discovered in the solar system that appears to have come from another part of the galaxy - and is assumed to be an asteroid. However, its elongated cigar shape and the fact that it is hundreds of metres in length but only one tenth as wide is peculiar for a typical space rock. At the moment there is ""no consensus"" on where the dark red object, which is around 400 metres (1,312ft) long, has come from. In a statement, the $100m (£75m) Seti project Breakthrough Listen said: ""Researchers working on long-distance space transportation have previously suggested that a cigar or needle shape is the most likely architecture for an interstellar spacecraft, since this would minimise friction and damage from interstellar gas and dust. ""While a natural origin is more likely, there is currently no consensus on what that origin might have been, and Breakthrough Listen is well positioned to explore the possibility that Oumuamua could be an artefact."" The team will use the Green Bank radio telescope in West Virginia to study the object, which is named after the Hawaiian word for ""scout"" or ""messenger"". The giant dish - the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world - will ""listen"" to Oumuamua across four radio frequency bands spanning one to 12 gigahertz from 8pm UK time on Wednesday. Lead scientist Dr Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley Seti Research Centre in California, said: ""Oumuamua's presence within our solar system affords Breakthrough Listen an opportunity to reach unprecedented sensitivities to possible artificial transmitters and demonstrate our ability to track nearby, fast-moving objects. ""Whether this object turns out to be artificial or natural, it's a great target for Listen."" Even if no evidence of extraterrestrial technology is found, researchers hope the mission could provide important information about gases surrounding the object or the presence or absence of water. The aim of the Breakthrough Listen project is to survey a million nearby stars and 100 nearby galaxies in the search for alien life. So far no convincing evidence of alien life has been found by Seti, despite almost 100 projects since the 1960s."
2017-12-12,"Critics of the gaming industry say in-game rewards called ""loot boxes"" are introducing young people to gambling behaviours, and even leading to them racking up huge bills.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/loot-boxes-blur-line-between-gaming-and-gambling-11168358,"Now regulators and politicians are warning that the line between video-gambling and gaming is becoming increasingly blurred and new laws may be needed to prevent the promise of in-game rewards turning young gamers into gamblers. ""Loot boxes"" can be earned through spending time playing a game, or bought instantly for real money. ""Opening"" a loot box rewards players with in-game items of varying rarity, but whether or not a player gets the item they want is ultimately down to luck. Put simply when you buy a loot box, you are not buying a particular item in a game, you are buying the chance of getting that item. If you don't get what you want, you may well be tempted to pay for another go. Natasha Beasley is a massive video games fan. She says it is all too easy to spend a fortune without realising the money's adding up. She said: ""I've seen people who don't have very much money spend way too much for a chance of getting something. ""Sometimes I'll spend £30 a month and I might get one thing [I want] but I'll regret the previous five because it didn't give me anything worth the amount I spent."" Speaking from WeGeek Gaming Utopia - a special event which includes gaming tournaments - she said it would be easier if the temptation wasn't there. ""It's definitely a gambling habit, it's the same as going in somewhere to gamble, it has that feeling of 'I'm going to take a chance on this',"" she said. ""You get that sense of satisfaction if you win, disappointment if you lose, but there's always a chance you could win next time..."" Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission says loot boxes are an area it is monitoring closely. ""We've been concerned for some time that the line between gaming and gambling is increasingly blurry,"" he said. ""It's harder for children and parents to understand which side of the line they might be on. We are taking clear action as a regulator to make sure we're patrolling that line, so that if things cross over into gambling we will take appropriate action. ""Many of these games will appeal to children and that's fine but if those games have mechanisms that allow children to gamble that is rightly a concern. ""If it crosses that line into gambling, we will take action... and if it comes close to that line, as parents, it's so important that we understand those risks and that we take action to keep our children safe online."" To date, the Gambling Commission's enforcement has been limited to a crackdown on so called ""skin betting"" websites, unlicensed sites that facilitate betting with items awarded from loot boxes, but some legislators think it's time to look closer at the addictive features of the games themselves. Daniel Zeichner, Labour MP for Cambridge, told Sky News: ""I think it either needs Government action or it needs the industry itself to take some action because there is a real risk to young people.... It's becoming addictive. ""We're hearing stories of people losing thousands of pounds quite quickly and I think if the industry can't sort it out then it does need new legislation."" Ukie - the body representing the UK gaming industry - says gaming developers are doing nothing wrong and reject calls for new rules. The association told Sky News: ""Loot boxes and the purchasing of in-game virtual items are already covered by and fully compliant with existing relevant UK regulations. """
2017-12-12,Noel Edmonds proposed settling a legal claim against Lloyds Banking Group for a small fraction of the £300m he originally sought in relation to a fraud involving Britain's biggest high street lender.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/no-deal-noel-edmonds-made-10m-lloyds-proposal-11167598,"Sky News has learnt that lawyers for Mr Edmonds, who hosted television shows including Deal or No Deal and Telly Addicts, told Lloyds during mediation talks last month that he would accept a £10m payment from the bank in exchange for dropping his claim. Lloyds rejected the offer, prompting the TV presenter to walk out of the meeting on 10 November. He is now preparing to launch formal legal proceedings against Lloyds early in the new year, which are expected to result in a claim for just under £70m and not the widely reported figure of up to £300m, according to insiders. The £300m figure was arrived at prior to the instruction of forensic accountants who have since determined a more precise value to Mr Edmonds' claim. The ongoing row between Mr Edmonds and Lloyds revolves around the collapse of his company Unique Group in 2007, which he alleges was the consequence of a fraud perpetrated by former employees of HBOS. The Reading branch of the bank, which was rescued by Lloyds TSB during the 2008 financial crisis, was at the centre of a conspiracy to load corporate clients with huge debts, then asset-strip them as they collapsed. Six people were jailed earlier this year for their roles in the fraud, and Lloyds has set aside £100m to compensate victims. The bank said that nearly two-thirds of the 63 former HBOS customers included in Lloyds' review had received compensation offers, and of those 41 parties, 35 had accepted the proposed settlements and been paid. Litigation funders are being lined up to finance Mr Edmonds' case, in which he will claim that Unique failed because of the fraud at HBOS' Impaired Assets Office in Reading. It was reported at the weekend that the former TV presenter was putting a £3m French chateau up for sale as he prepares to launch his legal action against Lloyds. Mr Edmonds' lawyer, Jonathan Coad, a consultant at Keystone Law, said: ""There is a confidentiality agreement governing the mediation. ""But it is public knowledge that it failed because Noel and his legal team walked out of it. ""Now Lloyds faces the grim prospect of a litigation process which will last at least 18 months and will inevitably cause immense additional harm to its already badly damaged brand, culminating in a two-week trial when its ugly wrongdoing and years of concealment are chronicled in detail."" Lloyds originally sued Mr Edmonds in 2008 in an effort to recover losses that had been incurred by HBOS on loans to Unique Group. However, it did not pursue a similar claim against the star's business partner, Paul Pascoe, instead agreeing a settlement with him which included a confidentiality clause. Responding to an enquiry about the £10m settlement proposal, Lloyds repeated an earlier statement, saying: ""Despite Lloyds Banking Group's determined efforts to reach a consensual resolution with Mr Edmonds through mediation, this has not been possible. ""As a result, a formal litigation process has begun. ""We recognise Mr Edmonds suffered personal distress and inconvenience as a result of him interacting almost a decade ago with an ex-HBOS employee convicted earlier this year in relation to criminal conduct at HBOS Reading Impaired Assets office. ""However, we strongly refute that this caused his business to collapse."""

Officers say there had been ""earlier incidents"" at the house and police had been in contact with the family just hours before the attack. Due to the previous interaction with the family, the force has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The fire at a house in Jackson Street, Worsley, trapped seven members of a family inside. Demi Pearson, 14, Brandon, 8, and Lacie, 7, all died. The childrens' mother, Michelle, is in a serious condition in hospital and a fourth sibling, three-year-old Lia, is critically ill. Ms Pearson, 35, is understood to be heavily sedated, and has not been told of her childrens' death. Two 16-year-old boys - Ms Pearson's son Kyle and a friend - managed to escape from the fire. So far, six people have been arrested in connection with the attack. A 20-year-old woman and four men - aged 25, 23, 20 and 19 - have all been arrested on suspicion of murder. The latter two have now been released on bail. A 24-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, and has also now been released on bail. Chief superintendent Wayne Miller said: ""We now have a much deeper understanding of the devastating events which lead to the tragic deaths of three children in Walkden in the early hours of yesterday morning and have made significant progress in this investigation. ""I cannot imagine what their family are going through, they are obviously completely devastated, the loss of a child in any circumstances is unthinkable; to lose three in such deplorable circumstances, words cannot describe. My heart breaks for them. ""We have a full team of detectives working on this case and now believe this be a targeted attack on the house after collecting CCTV from the area. ""This will be a painstaking investigation for all involved. We will continue to work with the fire service to establish the cause of the fire but this is not a quick process."" :: Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 0161 856 8797 or 101.

The company wrote: ""To the 53 people who've watched A Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days: Who hurt you?"" The intention was humorous, but many of Netflix's followers on Twitter were angry at the frivolous use of customer data. Angela Kay responded: ""Very creepy, Netflix. Not cool spying on your PAYING customers and then judging them in public."" It is normal for media subscription services to collect data and develop content to their customers' tastes and Netflix is not alone in calling users out based on that data. Music-streaming service Spotify ran an advertising campaign using users' playlist titles in 2016, mentioning playlists called ""I don't know how to make a playlist"" and ""sorry I lost your cat"". Netflix told Sky News: ""The privacy of our members' viewing is important to us. This information represents overall viewing trends, not the personal viewing information of specific, identified individuals."" Despite this assertion, those responding on Twitter were concerned about what they perceived as a privacy violation. One wrote: ""To the @Netflix employee who recently watched 1984: It's not an instruction manual."" The collection and processing of data on users is usually a part of the terms and conditions of signing up for services such as Netflix, but comes with legal responsibilities under the Data Protection Act. An ICO spokesperson told Sky News: ""Streaming and on-demand TV services such as Netflix commonly collect personal data about individuals' viewing habits in order to provide a more personalised experience - for example by suggesting new content that may be of interest. ""When data from lots of subscribers is aggregated together and anonymised, statistics which give insights into the viewing behaviours of the general population may be obtained. ""The Data Protection Act requires the collection and use of personal data to be fair and transparent.

While he had wanted to build an igloo before, ""there had never been enough snow"". But after seeing lots of the cold, fluffy white stuff in the garden on Sunday morning, the 29-year-old from Redditch turned to his girlfriend Jodie Giles and said: ""I'm going to build an igloo."" Ben admits that Jodie, from Wythall, her brother and his girlfriend thought he was ""mad"". Eight hours later, after making about 500 ice bricks and fashioning them into a small home complete with light, a door and a window, he was finished. The carpenter-joiner learned the process as he went along - admitting he ""should have googled the correct method"". He made each brick by packing snow into a small washing up bowl, started laying them down and just ""went with the flow"". It was ""almost like a sand castle"", he said, ""but with ice"". Even though he feared there might be an ""issue with the roof"", there were not any ""major disasters"". After he began to make progress, the others joined him, using a wheelbarrow to collect fresh snow. The finished structure, more than seven feet tall, was cosy. ""The ice works as a good thermal wall,"" Ben said. ""It was actually really warm in there."" He added: ""It was just really good fun. It was a day's work and it's got a lot more attention than I ever thought it would."" Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday, Ben said he thought it was still standing, but ""with a bit of a slant on it"", adding that it had gone ""a bit wibbly-wobbly"". Asked if he would like to go to a country where igloos are built, he said: ""I'd love to. If anyone wants to take me there and put me in touch with some real eskimos that would be amazing."""

At the end of November, Mr Trump caused controversy when he retweeted three anti-Muslim videos posted by the far-right group, including unverified footage purporting to show Muslims committing crimes. After Theresa May said the President was wrong to have done so, Mr Trump hit back by tweeting: ""Don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!"" Challenged about the incident on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Johnson said: ""I think a lot of that stuff was probably misinterpreted. ""I think the way I would look at it and I think the way that he looks at it is security is his number one oath when he took the oath of office, it is protecting Americans. ""Is he going to be perfect in appeasing everybody?"" The ambassador added: ""He is not going to go down the path of a lot of politicians and maybe be namby-pamby about it. ""He is going to come out, he is going to probably take some chances, in an effort to do that, to accomplish that security goal and maybe he will ruffle feathers. ""There is no question that maybe some feathers were ruffled with that but I think you have to have confidence, look down the road, and good things are going to happen."" Mr Johnson also said he expects Mr Trump's working visit to the UK to go ahead in 2018. The comments sparked anger from some MPs, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeting: ""Donald Trump's reckless actions are making the world less safe and setting back global action on climate change. ""When he comes to Britain, people will make their views known on these issues and show him we are a diverse and inclusive society."" Meanwhile, Labour MP Stella Creasy said welcoming Mr Trump to Britain effectively told women victims of sexual abuse that ""they don't matter"". Another Labour MP, Wes Streeting, wrote on Twitter: ""Not often I'll side with Theresa May, but this is a joke. ""She's been poorly treated by Trump and now appears naive for cosying up to such a volatile character so quickly."" Brendan Cox, widower of murdered MP Jo Cox, also posted minutes after the interview: ""The special relationship isn't about geography or even shared history. It's about shared values. Of tolerance, decency, democracy, rule of law. Trump is the antithesis of these."" Tory backbencher Michael Fabricant has slammed ""tedious gesture politics"" after reports women were planning to wear bright pink to protest Mr Trump's visit. He called the move ""utterly ineffectual"" and tweeted the hashtag ""#sad"" - in a similar style to the US President's own posts. Downing Street says Mr Trump's state visit invitation has been accepted but that a date has yet to be set."

She went on to say: ""I'm staggered we don't have sprinklers in domestic premises and schools. They save lives. They keep people safe, as well as putting the fire out."" Six months after the fire that killed 71 people, including an unborn baby, a public inquiry has now begun with a preliminary hearing providing information about the time frame and structure of the investigation. So far only 42 of the 208 families whose homes were destroyed in the blaze have been rehomed permanently, with many facing Christmas in hotels. Ms Cotton said the inquiry ""needs to explore every single aspect of what happened on that tragic night and beforehand"". Describing her arrival at the scene of the fire, she added: ""I was just incredulous. It genuinely looked like something that couldn't happen in England in this day and age."" Part of the inquiry will look at equipment used on the night of the fire and the ""stay put policy"" which advised residents to stay inside until the fire was contained in its unit of origin. Praising her staff who went back into the burning block time and time again, Ms Cotton said she would be ""fiercely defensive of the firefighters"" and wouldn't want to see any individuals singled out. Many firefighters who worked during the night of the Grenfell disaster are still receiving counselling to help them recover from the trauma of the fire. No evidence was heard during the two-day hearing which marks the beginning of the inquiry, however during representations concerns were raised that survivors wouldn't be listened to. Core participant status has been granted to 424 individuals and groups, allowing them the right to access evidence and challenge inquiry witnesses. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has now also launched an inquiry into the fire, part of which will look at whether authorities failed in their duty to protect life. Metropolitan Police is also investigating offences including manslaughter, corporate manslaughter, misconduct in public office and breaches of fire safety regulations in relation to the fire. Bereaved families and survivors of the fire have presented a petition to Downing Street, calling on Theresa May to appoint an independent panel to sit alongside the judge and be able to observe the decisions he makes. Former resident Nicholas Burton presented the petition, which attracted over 16,000 signatures, including those of singer Adele and actor Noel Clarke, to staff at Number 10. On Tuesday, speaking about Grenfell at the climate change summit in Paris, Theresa May said the aim of the public inquiry was ""to the truth, to get to an understanding of what happened, why it happened, so we can make sure this doesn't happen again"". When asked whether she would be likely to alter the make-up of the investigation's panel due to the petition she said: ""Sir Martin Moore-Bick has already appointed a number of advisers to work with him on this issue"". ""But, of course, we are always looking to ensure that this is an inquiry that is going to be able to get to the truth, provide people who have been victims of this terrible tragedy with what they want, which is justice and the truth about what happened."" The interim report into the fire is not expected to be published until next autumn."
2017-12-12,A hunt is on for missing fragments of a meteorite that lit up the sky across southern England as it fell to Earth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/did-meteorite-fragments-land-in-a-town-in-dorset-11167462,"Dozens of people reported seeing two fireballs across England, Wales and northern France at about midnight on Saturday 25 November and at about 6am later that morning. Several people captured videos and photos that showed large bright objects appearing to flare up and recede in the sky. Experts from the UK Meteor Observation Network (UKMON) have analysed the path of both objects and based upon their data, believe it is possible that a small amount of the first may have hit the ground. The researchers worked out that, after it stopped burning up at 15.5 miles (25km) high, it continued falling and may have eventually landed in Ferndown, Dorset, just north of Bournemouth. UKMON member Richard Fleet told Sky News: ""At 16km per second the midnight fireball was fairly slow as meteors go, which improves the chances of anything surviving. ""The meteoroid was fairly large at around 50kg and came from the asteroid belt so was likely to be of stony material. ""The conclusion is that there is a possibility of something having survived to the ground. ""Most of it was vaporised leaving maybe less than 1% of the original mass, so we are looking at a few hundred grams of material in the form of small stones scattered over a few kilometres."" But he added: ""Unless fragments this size land on open ground they're unlikely to be noticed."" Mr Fleet explained that, after the meteorite stops burning, it is almost in free fall - and can even be affected by high altitude winds. ""All that can really be said at this stage is that it may have landed near Ferndown in Dorset,"" he added. The report, by Czech expert Jakub Koukal, determined that the asteroid was probably connected to asteroid 2015 WZ1, a member of the class of so-called Apollo asteroids - near-earth objects - some of which have the potential to be hazardous. Mr Fleet said the later fireball is thought to have been caused by a fragment of a comet, which was smaller and made of more fragile material and is unlikely to have survived to the ground."

Armstrong is accused of ""taking advantage"" of his alleged victim, who is in her 20s, when she fell asleep as they were alone in the office of the Tory MP, Southwark Crown Court heard. The 24-year-old played jazz music, then started kissing and touching the woman before asking her back to his flat, jurors were told. The court heard that when she told Armstrong ""no"", he repeatedly called her a ""b****"" before taking off her clothes and assaulting her. Armstrong, of Danbury in Essex, denies two counts of rape, one of sexual assault and one of assault by penetration on 14 October last year. The defendant claimed in a police statement he gave shortly after being arrested that what took place happened with ""full consent"", the court heard. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said he raped her twice, abusing ""his role and his position"". ""She, in distress, walked and ran through the corridors of Westminster, eventually finding and telling cleaning staff what had happened,"" he said. ""He went out another way, using his pass and sending her messages, one of which suggested that he was concerned and that she contact him if she had 'any issues'."" The jury was told that on the day in question, Armstrong and the woman were drinking with others at the Sports and Social Bar. Then, at around 9.40pm, they went to the roof garden terrace so she could look at Big Ben, before going back to the bar. She said she had consumed four or five drinks but did not think she was ""tipsy"", describing the mood as ""very jolly"" and ""playful"". Around the time of last orders, Armstrong and the complainant went to Mr Mackinlay's office, where the defendant played jazz music on a laptop, the court heard. At this stage, neither looked particularly affected by drink, Mr Heywood said. The pair sat and talked on a three-seater sofa, where she fell asleep, the court heard. Mr Heywood said: ""This time is where it began to go wrong, in the early hours. It is the prosecution case, the defendant took advantage of the situation and of her obvious and open friendliness towards him."" Armstrong started kissing and touching the woman, before asking her to come back to his flat in Clapham, south London, the court heard. Jurors were told that when she mumbled ""no"" several times, the defendant's manner changed and he repeatedly called her a ""b****"". She ""froze"" as he became ""physical"", taking off her clothes and assaulting her, the court heard. Mr Heywood said the woman asked: ""What are you doing?"" ""This is what you want,"" Armstrong allegedly told her. Mr Heywood said: ""In saying that he was not, of course, genuinely speaking for her or reflecting any truth of the situation. He was imposing himself on her."" The woman was seen on CCTV running through the corridors of Westminster and leaving through Portcullis House just after 2am. The trial, which is set to last for two weeks, continues."
2017-12-12,"Thirteen-year-old Jemima Layzell, from Somerset, died in 2012 from a brain aneurysm.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/it-was-her-wish-to-live-on-daughters-organs-saved-eight-lives-11167348,"Earlier this year, it was revealed that the teenager had helped a record eight different people, including five children, through organ donation. Her mother Sophy Layzell spoke to Sky News about the family's decision: Five years ago I was so proud of my girls as they were just starting to be a bit more independent. They enjoyed bike rides together and I could rely on Jemima, 13, to look after her little sister Amelia, 11, as she was incredibly cautious and conscientious. Jemima was blossoming, in confidence and her outlook on life was growing more positive by the day. At 13 she could now fit into my clothes and on the day she died she looked like an angel in white. New white jeans (despite it being a rabbit hutch cleaning day) and she had borrowed my favourite white blouse with butterflies on it. It was a joyous time and the house was clean for once as we had all pulled together to tidy every room ready for my 38th birthday party on Saturday 10 March. :: End 'fatal reluctance' to discuss organ donation When Jemima suddenly collapsed during the preparations, I was still caught in hostess mode as guests were arriving and I remember asking the paramedics if they wanted a cup of tea. It felt unbelievably surreal with the table laid with our best china while our eldest daughter was struggling to express her last conscious thoughts. It took years to set the table up like that again and even now there are some glasses I avoid using. An unconscious Jemima was rushed from our house to Musgrove hospital in Taunton where scans indicated a tumour. She was then transferred to Frenchay in Bristol where it became apparent that it wasn't a tumour but a massive bleed caused by a burst aneurysm. The surgeons operated into the night, while we sat in a small waiting room, alone waiting into the small hours. Over the next few days our emotions yo-yoed from hope to despair as her condition changed. I felt suspended in time, life stopped and all we focused on was our girls. Amelia was with us every step of the way and the three of us time-shared the bunk beds in the hospital quarters. In a sleep deprived haze we muddled through, trusting and hoping, but all the time preparing for the worst. The worst finally came on Wednesday 14 March and it was not long before the organ donation team approached us. We had known that it was something that we would be asked and we were prepared, by sheer chance, as it was something we had discussed with Jemima just a few weeks before. A friend of the family had died in a car accident and although he had been on the organ donation list he wasn't able to donate owing to the nature of his death. Both our girls had been quite surprised that such a thing was possible, but Jemima said that it was something she would do, but she couldn't decide which organs she would give, we would have to decide that. I felt very strongly that it was something that she wanted us to agree to, partly from the conversation we had, and partly because it just felt the right thing to do. It wasn't easy though, as you feel as though you are giving something precious away and your instinct is to keep it; to keep your child's body protected. Each organ and tissue was debated separately and we agreed to donating her corneas, liver stem cells, liver (which was split into two), kidneys, lungs, small bowel, pancreas and her heart. We hesitated over her heart as her dad almost couldn't bear it, but we agreed in the end and are now so glad we did. It saved the life of a five-year-old boy and if we had said no, his parents would have gone through what we have. Although we have exchanged letters with some of the recipients, which is something that the organ donation team facilitate, we have not met any of them. That is something we are not yet ready for, but we have met the parents of the boy who received part of her liver. They send us regular updates of his progress and it is wonderful to see him so fit, healthy and enjoying life. I have approached the opt-out system cautiously. At first I felt it took away what should be an altruistic gift, but that was my own jealous pride as Jemima's mother talking. I also listened to anti opt-out campaigners anxiously and worried that pushing people too soon would have negative lash backs. There's a stubborn streak in our culture that doesn't like to be told what to do. That's why my most passionate message is ""TALK ABOUT IT"". The more we talk, the less taboo it becomes, and the less we fear death, the more openly we can face the issues surrounding it. Whatever the legislation, hard opt-out, soft opt-out, if we have discussed our wishes with our loved ones then the right decision can be made for us. If Jemima had said no, we would have never felt confident to say yes. At 13 she had her own views on animal rights, euthanasia and organ donation, and defying those wishes would have been impossible. Her wish to live on in others, has made her death so much easier for us. She lives forever in our hearts and has begun a new family tree of her own."
2017-12-12,Oscar Pistorius has been injured after getting involved in a prison fight.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/oscar-pistorius-injured-in-prison-fight-over-phone-11167586,"The former Paralympic champion had an altercation with another inmate over a public telephone earlier this month. In a statement, South Africa's Department of Correctional Services said Pistorius sustained a bruise during the incident inside the special care unit of Atteridgeville Correctional Centre. Reports suggest fellow prisoners had grown angry with how long the 31-year-old was taking to use the phone, and the fight is now under investigation. Pistorius is serving a 13-year sentence for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013. Last month, his original sentence was more than doubled by the Supreme Court of Appeal after a court ruled it was too lenient. Double amputee Pistorius was moved to the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre, which caters for inmates with physical disabilities, in November 2016. Pistorius was originally convicted of culpable homicide - the equivalent of manslaughter over the killing - but this was later upgraded to murder. He claimed he thought Ms Steenkamp was an intruder when he shot her four times though a toilet door at his home in Pretoria."
2017-12-12,The rate of inflation unexpectedly rose to a near six-year high of 3.1% in November - led by a hike in the cost of air travel and computer games.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/inflation-rises-slightly-to-31-in-november-11167536,"It was the highest Consumer Price Index measure of inflation (CPI) since March 2012, and means the cost of living continues to increase well ahead of wage growth. The reading remains above the Bank of England's inflation target of 2% - and it defied economists' expectations that it would remain static at 3%. The Bank raised interest rates to 0.5% in early October to help tackle inflation. Governor Mark Carney must now pen a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond explaining why the rate missed the Bank's target by more than one percentage point. CPI measures the growth in price of everyday items including fuel, food, clothing and household goods. Inflation has been accelerating largely thanks to the collapse in the pound following the Brexit vote, which makes imported goods more expensive. The ONS said the main upward pressure last month came from transport costs, where prices rose by 0.1% between October and November this year, compared with a fall of 0.3% between the same two months a year ago. This was largely down to air fares, which fell more slowly by 10.4% this year compared with a larger 13.4% drop a year ago. Rising prices for food and a range of recreational and cultural goods and services, in particular computer games, also had an upward impact. Motorists also faced higher fuel costs in November, with petrol up by 1.8p per litre month on month to 119.1p, and diesel rising by 2.3p a litre to 122.8p. Economists said the inflation rise would mean an expensive Christmas for many households - and did not rule out a further interest rate hike. Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""Some of the latest surveys suggest service sector costs and prices are rising. Given how dominant services are in the economy, this could feed through to inflation overall. That means that further interest rate rises are definitely not off the table. ""The Bank of England has a tricky tightrope to walk. Too much inflation could threaten the Bank's credibility and therefore its grip on the economy."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, added: ""It's going to be a costly Christmas for many, with prices significantly higher than last year, and wages falling behind. That's particularly the case given that inflation is evident across all categories of festive fare, namely food, alcohol, clothing and recreation."" Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Inflation is expected to fall over the coming year, but I recognise families are feeling a squeeze now. ""We are determined to help, which is why the Autumn Budget cut income tax, boosted basic pay by more than inflation and froze alcohol and fuel duties."""
2017-12-12,The UK is facing another freezing night after a week that saw temperatures plummet lower than those in Moscow and Oslo. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/severe-weather-warning-for-ice-issued-as-uk-reels-from-five-day-freeze-11168192,"Following a weekend gripped by the coldest temperatures of 2017, the freeze is expected to loosen its hold on Wednesday. But a severe yellow weather warning will continue until 11am across most of England, Wales and Scotland, as remaining ice threatens treacherous conditions on roads and paths. The coldest temperature of the last five days - in Shawbury in Shropshire - was a low of -13C, with the mercury in Powys falling to -10.1C and in Loch Ness -9.1C. In Oslo temperatures were -6C and Moscow -2C. Many areas enjoyed a blanket of snow thick enough for sledging and snowmen - in Sennybridge, Wales, 30cm of the white stuff was recorded, while High Wycombe saw 18cm fall. Across the country, that had a knock-on effect for hundreds of schools which were forced to close. Severe weather warnings were in place into Tuesday, and icy roads and compacted snow led to concerns of treacherous conditions. Thousands of homes were also left without power. Western Power Distribution engineers restored power to 99,500 homes, while SSE restored power to 50,000 homes across Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire on Sunday. The freeze also coincided with the beginning of cold weather protocol for homeless charities, and cold weather shelters in the UK opened their doors to people sleeping on the streets. Disruptions also grounded flights and caused delays to and from airports including Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh. British Airways cancelled 170 flights on Sunday and more than 100 on Monday. Meanwhile, rail disruptions caused travel chaos, with cancellations between Birmingham and Bristol after a landslide caused by the severe weather. The Port of Calais was also closed, after a ferry carrying 300 people ran aground as it attempted to depart for Dover in a storm. The lowest daily temperature ever recorded in the UK was -27.2C, registered in 1982, 1985 and 1995 in Braemar and Altnaharra in Scotland."

Police say the driver failed to stop at the scene and the woman was then hit by a second lorry and two cars, the drivers of which all failed to stop. The incident happened shortly before 7am on Monday on Norwood Road, with the victim - who has not yet been identified - being pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics around half an hour later. Acting detective sergeant Alastair Middleton said: ""I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision and the moments afterwards to contact us.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit at Merton on 020 8543 5157. Members of the community expressed their shock over the incident. Navin Bagan, who works at Tulse Hill cafe, described the drivers as ""heartless"". ""They just left her to die - it is not right,"" she said. ""This road is sometimes very busy in the mornings, but that's not an excuse for a car to hit a lady and run off. She's only in her 20s or 30s. ""Maybe they didn't have a drivers' licence or insurance or something. ""I hope they find them. I'm sure they will find them - it's a busy road, there are lots of security cameras."""
2017-12-12,"The Prime Minister will be delighted to have negotiated the Brexit process to this point of ""sufficient progress"" on initial divorce matters.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/pms-brexit-fudge-recipe-might-yet-leave-bad-taste-11161422,"But the progress, as well as being delayed by a couple of months, is not as far as she would have wanted. Immediate discussions will begin on a transition period, before talks about trade, which will still take some time to prepare internally by the 27 other EU member states. On Northern Ireland, the important point is Mrs May and her diplomats managed, in the early hours of Friday, to square off both Dublin and Belfast on the thorny issue of the Irish border. The change in words within Friday's agreed text were more about providing clarity rather than a fundamental change in the meaning of what had already been agreed on Monday. Instead of ""full regulatory alignment"", the new wording is ""full alignment with the rules"" of the EU's single market and customs union, which underpin the Good Friday Agreement and an open border. The recipe of the fudge has changed only a little, but sufficiently enough for the DUP to claim to have won ""six substantive changes"" to the wording. The key point is the position on Monday had left until the second phase of Brexit negotiations the precise degree of ""alignment"" required to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Dublin and Brussels believes this will be widespread, touching upon dozens of areas, but Belfast thinks it is just two or three. Over the past week the UK was quite literally negotiating with itself amid talks in Whitehall between the UK Government and Northern Ireland's DUP. The other substantive point of compromise in Friday's agreement is the length of a referral period for the European Court of Justice to enforce the rights of EU citizens. Both sides have compromised here. The EU asked for 15 years' of jurisdiction, the UK for five years. They have opted for eight years. It seems this is acceptable for Tory Brexiteers, but that is not what they were saying only a few months ago. This speaks to a wider truth. The real story of Brexit's first phase is how the Prime Minister has managed to get her own MPs to wear a series of compromises: on transition, sequencing, financial settlement, rights and potentially Ireland, too. Brexiteer MPs have shown that when push comes to shove, any Brexit is better than the risk of a Government collapse meaning no Brexit. Effectively, phase two negotiations are now for agreeing a transition period while phase three is for trade talks. A transition period will see Britain remain in the customs union and single market for two years. European Council President Donald Tusk revealed the UK has asked for this, but also warned it will mean Britain is obliged to accept new EU laws during the period. In practice, this will not change a great deal over the two years, but had previously been ruled out by Brexiteers. We are still some months from talking about trade, and years from actual trade talks. The really difficult stuff is now deciding the Brexit end state. Should it be high alignment and high access to the EU, such as a Norway-style deal? Or will it be low alignment and low access, such as a Canada-style trade deal? The question is whether the fall-back position for the Irish border of ""full alignment"" with the EU pre-configures that shape in some way. Logically one would presume so. If there's no deal, then we get full alignment. The idea that a deal would then see low alignment seems unlikely. But ministerial sources are adamant this is a red herring. They say Britain will enjoy full regulatory independence, there will be outcome equivalence but autonomy on reaching those outcomes, and the terms of Friday's deal on the Irish border are just a contingency. Longstanding Brexiteers would have preferred the word ""equivalence"" in Friday's agreement, and some trust has been lost by the fact this was not cleared in advance by the Cabinet sub-committee. They are still concerned and this will now be thrashed out in Cabinet as early as next week. The big winners here are the business community, who forced Number 10 to do whatever it takes to achieve a quickly agreed transition deal. That is why quick compromises were made by Mrs May. The second phase of negotiations will be even harder. A fudge only goes so far. It is an achievement for the Prime Minister to have got here. It is a significant achievement to have got the Cabinet and the DUP to sign up to this. But the real victory would be to get all her MPs on side. It is unclear if that is the case."

It is claimed the brothers had cameos in The Last Jedi - but the cast we spoke to remained tight-lipped about whether they really did appear in the film. ""That's what I hear too,"" said Oscar Isaac, who plays Poe Dameron, when we asked him about the rumours. ""That's exciting right? Let's see if it's true."" And he was not the only one wary of saying too much on the red carpet. Domhnall Gleeson, who returns as General Hux, admitted that although the film is almost out, he is still not able to spill the beans.

Mark Hamill, who worked with her on the original film 40 years ago, told Sky News that she is ""wonderful"" in this instalment of the franchise. ""Over the years we had our ups and downs, sometimes we were more like real brother and sister than we would like to admit, because we were highly critical,"" Hamill said.

2017-12-12,Around half of Ryanair pilots based in Ireland are due to strike days before Christmas in a long-running dispute over workers' rights.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/ryanair-pilots-to-strike-in-run-up-to-christmas-11167917,"The strike, scheduled for Wednesday 20 December, involves the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) and the IMPACT trade union. It is unclear at this stage what impact it will have on people travelling home for Christmas but most of the pilots balloted for strike action are captains. The union claims 94% of the directly-employed pilots backed strike action. However a majority of Ryanair pilots who are either contracted or hired through intermediary arrangements in the Republic of Ireland were not balloted. This is only part of a series of industrial disputes facing the low cost airline across Europe over negotiating and collective bargaining rights. Italian pilots are scheduled to stop work for four hours between 1pm and 5pm this Friday. Meanwhile, German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit have warned industrial action may spread to Ryanair pilots in Germany and have not ruled out also taking industrial action in the Christmas period And Portuguese-based pilots have also balloted for industrial action, but so far have not served notification of any industrial action. Ashley Connolly, an official at Irish trade union IMPACT, said: ""This dispute is solely about winning independent representation for pilots in the company. ""Management's failed negotiating model has let down shareholders and tens of thousands of passengers, whose flights were cancelled this year because company-controlled industrial relations proved incapable of recruiting and retaining enough pilots. ""The failed policy threatens to further disappoint shareholders and passengers, and further damage the airline's reputation, because experienced pilots continue to leave the airline in droves. ""This dispute is about securing a safe space for negotiations, with independent representation that pilots can have confidence in"". The union has also not ruled out further strike days if agreement is not reached. The airline said: ""Ryanair will deal with any such disruptions if, or when they arise, and we apologise sincerely to customers for any upset or worry this threatened action by less than 28% of our Dublin pilots may cause them over the coming days. ""While some disruption may occur, Ryanair believes this will largely be confined to a small group of pilots who are working their notice and will shortly leave Ryanair, so they don't care how much upset they cause colleagues or customers."" Ryanair's statement noted that the threatened industrial action was about union recognition rather than the pay of Dublin-based pilots, earning €150,000-€190,000 per year, who had been offered a 20% pay rise. The airline said it was entitled to decline to engage with what it called ""competitor"" pilot unions. ""Ryanair will not recognise an Aer Lingus pilot union, no matter how often or how long this tiny minority try to disrupt our flights or our customer plans during Christmas week,"" its statement said. Ryanair said IALPA's own numbers showed it had the support of less than 28% of Ryanair's more than 300 Dublin pilots."
2017-12-12,"Theresa May has insisted the Government is ""listening"" to potential Tory rebels as the Prime Minister was warned she faces a humiliating defeat on flagship Brexit legislation.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171213034106/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-staring-at-eu-withdrawal-bill-defeat-in-house-of-commons-11168502,"If neither ministers or unhappy Conservative MPs back down, the Government will face a crunch vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill on Wednesday night. As many as 20 Tory MPs could defy the Prime Minister by backing an amendment calling for a ""meaningful"" vote on any Brexit deal - a rebellion sizeable enough to bring the Government's first defeat on the key bill. MPs from across the House of Commons have been urged to back the amendment, brought by Conservative backbencher Dominic Grieve, and likely to be backed by Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats. His amendment calls for the UK's divorce deal with the EU to be approved by Parliament prior to it being implemented. Ministers have promised MPs a say on the Brexit deal, but many fear the Government will merely offer a ""take-it-or-leave it"" vote. So far, the Government has seen off a string of proposed amendments to the bill, which aims to ready the UK's statute book for Brexit. Asked on the eve of the vote whether she had a message for potential rebels such as Mr Grieve, the Prime Minister appeared to hint the Government could yet concede on the amendment in order to avoid defeat. She said: ""There are obviously colleagues who are concerned about some of the issues around the processes in the House of Commons and who are looking for reassurance around the Withdrawal Bill, around the withdrawal agreement, around how clause nine is going to be used. ""And, of course we've been listening and talking to those colleagues."" One of the potential Tory rebels, Heidi Allen, expressed her hope ministers will yet back down, posting on Twitter: ""I am hopeful the Government will concede on this... there's still time before votes tomorrow."" Mrs Allen's fellow Remain-supporting Conservative and potential rebel, Anna Soubry, used Tuesday's debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill to urge the Government to ""give a little bit more"" to reach out to the 48% of voters who wanted to stay in the EU. She said: ""For people to say that in a tabling of an amendment you are somehow trying to thwart or stop Brexit is frankly gravely offensive and that level of insult, because it is an insult, has got to stop."" Mr Grieve warned the Government there is a ""real possibility"" they will be defeated if they try to block his amendment, as he suggested he had ""enough"" support to win a vote. He told the BBC: ""I don't see any possibility of my backing down on this at all."" Mrs Allen, Ms Soubry and Mr Grieve are all among those Tory MPs to have been branded ""Brexit mutineers"", due to their readiness to defy the Government on the EU Withdrawal Bill. And the possibility of a House of Commons showdown on Wednesday has already sparked a fresh bout of Tory infighting over Brexit. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused Mr Grieve of ""grandstanding"" and trying to tie the Government's hands in negotiations. The Brexiteer also suggested rebels are looking to ""derail"" the EU Withdrawal Bill. Ahead of a possible vote, Labour's shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook urged Tory MPs to see through their threats of rebellion. ""Tory rebels have talked the talk, now they must walk the walk,"" he said. ""The decision MPs make today will determine whether or not the UK goes down the path of a Brexit that respects parliamentary democracy. ""Labour have always been clear that Parliament, not ministers, must have the final say on the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU."" The Liberal Democrat's Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, a supporter of the pro-EU Open Britain group, said: ""Given the lack of respect shown for Parliament so far, we can't trust anything ministers say about allowing MPs a meaningful vote on any Brexit deal. ""The only way to guarantee that MPs will have the ability to vote on Brexit on behalf of our constituents is for us to come together and back amendment seven."" The crunch vote could come just hours before the Prime Minister heads to a summit in Brussels on Thursday, where she expects EU leaders to sanction the start of Brexit trade talks."
2017-12-21,The plight of Toys R Us UK is one that encapsulates many of the woes of traditional high street retailers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171221233940/https://news.sky.com/story/toys-r-us-not-alone-in-facing-string-of-challenges-in-retail-sector-11179623,"Online retailers have been able to sell toys more cheaply than it has been able to, thanks to not being burdened by overheads such as onerous property leases, business rates and Sunday trading laws, all of which hand online retailers a significant advantage. In the case of Toys R Us, it has also been hit by the loss in appeal of big out-of-town stores, in favour of smaller premises that can be used to showcase products that can then be bought on a ""click and collect"" basis. That is a problem that has not just afflicted Toys R Us but other rivals, notably Tesco, one of the pioneers in the field. As Steve Knights, the managing director of Toys R Us UK has admitted, the warehouse-style stores that it opened in the 1980s and 1990s, while successful in those days, ""are too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment"". Adding to the operation's woes has been the delay to the revaluation of business rates by the Government. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, announced in last month's Budget that, from next April, the rise in business rates will henceforth be indexed to the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rather than the higher Retail Prices Index. That reform is expected to save businesses £2.3bn during the next five years, while business rates will now be revalued every three years instead of every five years, making changes to rates less of a shock for retailers - like Toys R Us UK - that have large store estates. However, according to the property services company Colliers International, if this reform had been announced two years ago, it would have saved Toys R Us UK £17m. John Webber, the head of rating at Colliers International, told Property Week earlier this month: ""The stores in some parts of the country have been forced to pay for the better ones for far too long in terms of business rates. ""Taking the Exeter store as an example, the rates bill should have decreased by around 34%. But because of phasing, reductions have only been a small percentage this year and next. The business therefore will overpay in excess of £800,000 in business rates on that store alone. ""That's a lot of Barbies to sell."" Onto all of these woes can be overlaid the weak state of consumer confidence which, according to the latest figures published by research house GfK, has just slumped to its weakest level since December 2013. Confidence among British consumers has now been falling for almost two years and trading is said to have been weak across the high street since the rash of ""Black Friday"" promotions at the end of November. All this, according to the insolvency advisers Begbies Traynor, has put 43,677 retailers in ""significant financial distress"" - up by almost a quarter on December last year. The grocery wholesaler Palmer & Harvey has already gone under, with the loss of 3,000 jobs, while credit insurers - the crucial players that grease the wheels of the retail trade by protecting suppliers in the event of a retailer going bust before they get paid - are said to have reduced or, in some cases taken away entirely, cover for the electricals chain Maplins and the discount retailer Poundland. In the case of the latter, it is said to be trading well, but confidence among credit insurers has been rattled by problems in its South African parent Steinhoff, whose other UK assets include the furniture chains Bensons for Beds and Harveys. In the case of Toys R Us, there are also specific factors at play, not least the difficulties of its US parent company. It has debts totalling $5bn and filed for bankruptcy protection in September. Earlier this week, it reported that in the three months to October, it made a net loss of $623m after sales fell by nearly 5% - with like-for-like sales in the US down by 7%. The complex structure of Toys R Us, which has 17 subsidiaries including Toys R Us UK, may have contributed to the group's problems in Britain. There are said to be numerous inter-company loans in the business - which may help explain loans worth some £584.5m, that have apparently been written off, made by Toys R Us UK to a British Virgin Islands-based based entity. However, it is being suggested that rather than siphoning off money from the UK, other companies in the Toys R Us Group have been providing financial support to Toys R Us UK in the form of short term inter-company loans. On top of that, of course, is the pension fund - the issue that has brought to a head the crisis at Toys R Us UK. The pensions scheme at the business has a deficit of £30m. But, in order for the scheme to be tipped into the Pension Protection Fund lifeboat, the PPF is requiring Toys R Us UK to make a £9m contribution to the deficit. Toys R Us UK claims not to have the money while the wider Toys R Us Group claims it is unable to provide it due to its bankruptcy protection process. The pensions situation is also likely to be an issue hurting other UK retailers. A decade of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing has depressed the yield on UK government gilts - a key measure by which future pension liabilities are calculated. Pension deficits everywhere have been growing, obliging companies everywhere to pay more into their schemes, something that in particular has hit retailers employing large numbers of people. Toys R Us is extremely unlikely to be the last British retailer to experience turmoil this winter."

While it said the figure represented the biggest drop in domestic demand since September 2011, it pointed out that it left production for UK consumers 9% down in the year to date. There was an annual fall just shy of 30% in 2011. The SMMT said 161,490 cars left British factories last month, down by 4.6%. But it added that a 1.3% increase in exports helped cushion the overall decline, as the global economy continues to accelerate at a faster rate than its home market. The SMMT has been one of the most vocal critics of the Brexit vote - demanding tariff-free access to its biggest market after the UK's divorce from the EU. Domestic sales - as well as production - have taken a hit this year as consumers become more cautious about splashing out on so-called ""big ticket"" items. :: New diesel sales down almost a third in November The car industry feels hard done by as it demands information on the UK's future trading relationship with the EU - with the Government signalling its intention to ban the sale of new all-petrol and diesel models from 2040. It also made diesels a tax target in last month's Budget. SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: ""Brexit uncertainty, coupled with confusion over diesel taxation and air quality plans, continues to impact domestic demand for new cars and, with it, production output. ""Whilst it is good to see exports grow in November, this only reinforces how overseas demand remains the driving force for UK car manufacturing. ""Clarity on the nature of our future overseas trading relationships, including details on transition arrangements with the EU, is vital for future growth and success."""
2017-12-21,A firearms dealer who sold handguns and home-made bullets that were linked to more than 100 crime scenes has been jailed for 30 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171221233940/https://news.sky.com/story/firearms-dealer-paul-edmunds-jailed-for-30-years-for-selling-weapons-used-in-crimes-11179887,"Paul Edmunds, 66, imported a Colt pistol used in a fatal shooting at a nightclub in London. He also supplied ammunition used in two other killings and an attempt to shoot down a police helicopter. Police arrested Edmunds, of Bristol Road, Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, in 2015 and found three armouries and made bullets to fit antique weapons. Edmunds, a registered firearms dealer, was found guilty in November of conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition and smuggling banned Colt handguns into the UK from the US. Judge Richard Bond told the pensioner: ""You ran roughshod over your legal responsibilities as a registered firearms dealer."" He added: ""You were at the top of the chain of supply of handguns and ammunition to criminal gangs. ""Without your actions the numerous handguns and hand-loaded ammunition would not have found their way on to the streets of the United Kingdom. ""Quite simply, you were the lynchpin to this conspiracy and without you it could not have been carried out."" Standing a few feet away from Edmunds in the gallery were the parents of 18-year-old shooting victim, Kenichi Phillips, killed in Birmingham in March 2016. As jurors heard, one of Edmunds' unfired rounds was found at the scene of that murder, which was among 107 crime scenes linked to the pensioner's trade. At a re-trial earlier this year the jury heard how Edmunds and middleman Dr Mohinder Surdhar acted together to supply antique revolvers and custom-made ammunition to criminal gangs. Physiotherapist Surdhar,56, from Grove Lane, Handsworth, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition between 2009 and 2015 before Edmunds' trial and will be sentenced on Friday. But Edmunds, a father of two, had denied hand-crafting bullets for use in supposedly obsolete vintage weapons, including 19th century revolvers, which he brought into the country legally. But the jury dismissed this and also convicted him of possessing a prohibited air pistol and perverting the course of justice by filing down a bullet-making tool to destroy potential evidence. As well as importing antique weapons, the gun fanatic also imported hundreds more modern prohibited firearms from the United States, having falsified customs paperwork. The judge said he had been ""aghast"" to hear from one legally-registered firearms importer who gave trial evidence on how packages are ""not always checked"" by UK border officials. He said ""this lax attitude ... means that those who can lawfully bring weapons into this country can do so without them being properly checked""."
2017-12-21,Theresa May is proposing a crackdown on unscrupulous dog breeders who keep animals in poor conditions.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171221233940/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-to-order-crackdown-on-unscrupulous-dog-breeders-11180352,"The measures will include tighter regulations on online sellers and legislation to ensure breeders can only sell puppies alongside their mothers. Thousands of puppies are sold every year after being born in remote puppy farms, often in Northern Ireland and Wales, where the mothers are kept in small unhygienic cells with no access to proper exercise. The puppies tend to come with congenital problems associated with over-bred, malnourished mothers, leaving the new owners with large vet bills. They are also often transported for long distances before sale. As a child, the PM had a poodle called Tassle and then a part-Labrador rescue dog called Lucky, though she's not owned a dog since. Mrs May said: ""The arrival of a happy, healthy puppy, as I know myself, is a memorable time for a family - but it's absolutely right we do everything we can to eradicate animal cruelty from our society. ""The proposals my government is developing will be an important step forward."" Plans under consideration include: :: Tightening regulations so that puppy sales are completed in the presence of the new owner - preventing online sales where prospective buyers have not seen the animal first. :: Measures to ensure the buyers can see a puppy with its mother. :: Insisting that licensed dog breeders can only sell puppies they have bred themselves. :: Regulating adverts, including on the internet, by ensuring licensed sellers of all pets, including puppies, include the seller's licence number, country of origin and country of residence of the pet in any advert for sale. The proposals are expected to be brought to Parliament early in the New Year. Measures to tackle unethical and cruel puppy smuggling across borders will also be explored. And the plans will address the breeding of dogs with harmful genetic disorders too. Environment Secretary Michael Gove had a Yorkie when he was young called Sparky, and currently has two dogs: Snowy, a Bichon Frise, and Muffin, a Lhasa Apso. He said: ""At this time of year it is all too easy to be moved by images online or adverts in the local press advertising newborn puppies looking for a home for Christmas. But what we don't see is all too often a sad history of mistreatment and malpractice. ""This is one part of our efforts to ensure we have the highest animal welfare standards in the world. We have also ensured CCTV cameras will be mandatory in all slaughterhouses and will increase prison sentences from six months to five years for animal abusers."" In addition, the Government is taking forward proposals put out for consultation earlier this year to improve how the pets are bred and sold. This includes a ban on the sale of puppies and kittens under the age of eight weeks, which will now extend to include rabbits. There will also be compulsory licencing for anyone in the business of breeding and selling dogs."
2017-12-21,Theresa May has reiterated her concerns about comments made by police officers in relation to pornography found on Damian Green's computer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171221233940/https://news.sky.com/story/green-refuses-to-comment-after-sacking-for-breaching-ministers-code-by-lying-11179690,"Speaking after a bilateral meeting with the Polish Prime Minister in Warsaw, Mrs May said she expects statements made by Metropolitan Police officers over the saga to be ""properly investigated"". The Prime Minister told reporters: ""I share the concerns that have been expressed about the comments that were made by a former officer of the Metropolitan Police and I expect that issue to be properly investigated, properly considered and I expect those concerns to be taken seriously."" Her comments came as Scotland Yard announced it had referred former assistant commissioner Bob Quick and a second retired officer, Neil Lewis, to privacy watchdog the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) over possible breaches of data protection laws. Mr Green was asked to step down from his job as First Secretary of State, a role which effectively made him the PM's deputy, on Wednesday after a Cabinet Office investigation found he breached the ministerial code. An investigation found that while his ""conduct as a minister has generally been both professional and proper"", he had given ""misleading"" statements in relation to what he knew about the pornography claims, which prompted Mrs May to ask him to resign. Mr Green continues to deny downloading or viewing the legal material, and the report reached ""no conclusion"" on this aspect of the saga. The MP for Ashford in Kent refused to answer reporters' questions as he left his London house in Acton on Thursday, saying: ""I'm not going to say anything."" But later he tweeted: ""I am overwhelmed by the number of friends, colleagues (on all sides) and constituents who have sent supportive messages this morning. My thanks to you all, and a Happy Christmas. See you in 2018."" Mrs May's spokesman said on Thursday that she would not be appointing a replacement immediately. Jeremy Hunt said it was clear the PM acted with a ""very heavy heart"" when she ordered Mr Green to tender his resignation after summoning him to No 10 on Wednesday evening. But the Health Secretary also said there were questions to answer about the conduct of the retired police officer who leaked details of the raid on Mr Green's Commons office in 2008 when pornographic images were found on his computer. ""If you look at what happened, some of the actions of a retired police office don't sit comfortably in a democracy,"" Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Theresa May made very clear in her letter that she was very uncomfortable with what had happened and she was pleased that Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, also felt that. ""I think there are various other things we do need to get to the bottom of."" His words were echoed by Conservative former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who was part of an investigation into police misconduct over the ""plebgate"" row. Mr Mitchell told Sky News: ""These two admitted breaches of the ministerial code are dwarfed by the extraordinary behaviour of the police, which fortunately is now under investigation by the proper authorities."" But Labour MP Jess Phillips said she was worried that the focus on the behaviour of the police was an attempt to steer attention away from other issues raised by the affair. A Labour Party Spokesperson added: """"The public deserve the highest standards from ministers which begs questions around the Prime Minister's judgement and why she delayed this decision for so long. ""To lose her number two in government in such a way, and so soon after two other ministers, leaves her further weakened."" The inquiry was launched after Kate Maltby, a Conservative activist and journalist 30 years Mr Green's junior, complained he had made inappropriate advances. Then the former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick went public with his claims about the discovery of pornography. While saying he did not ""recognise the events"" Ms Maltby described in a newspaper article about the alleged advances, Mrs May admitted he may have made her ""feel uncomfortable"" and apologised."

Apple has now admitted that the slowing of the phone's central processing unit (CPU) does take place, although not to force consumers to upgrade their devices. The act of slowing down a computer processor is called ""downclocking"" or ""underclocking"". Following a study by a Reddit user who claimed that Apple's tech automatically slowed phones when the battery has a diminished charge capacity, the company said this was due to a need to protect electronic components. In a statement, Apple said that, as they age, lithium-ion batteries used in its phones become less able to provide the top levels of electrical current needed. The problems with peak current draws especially occur when batteries are cold or low on charge - ""which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components"", Apple said. iPhone users had complained about their devices turning off abruptly even when they had a significant amount of charge left. Apple said: ""Last year, we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions."" ""We've now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future. ""Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers."" Lithium-ion batteries lose their capacity over time due to the physical wear-and-tear of ions passing through the material of the battery. Replacing the lithium-ion battery, which costs £79 in the UK, should allow them to work at normal speeds again."

The complainant, who is in her 20s, said she ""felt like a hostage"" and claimed she was raped twice by Mr Armstrong, a senior aide for South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay. But Mr Armstrong, of Danbury in Essex, insisted they had consensual sex. The pair drank in a bar on the parliamentary estate and watched Big Ben chime on its terrace on the evening of 13 October 2016, the trial heard. The court was told that they then went back to Mr Mackinlay's office, where prosecutors alleged Mr Armstrong ""abused his position"". He was arrested after CCTV pictures showed the woman running through the corridors of Westminster in tears in the early hours of the following day. On Thursday, a jury of five men and seven women found him not guilty on two counts of rape, one of sexual assault and one of assault by penetration. The two-week trial at Southwark Crown Court concluded after the jury took more than five hours to return verdicts. Mr Armstrong had tears in his eyes as he left the dock to be comforted by his father. His boss, Mr Mackinlay, had previously told the court he and his aide were like ""father and son"". The politics and history graduate from Nottingham University said the allegations had cost him his ""dream job"", adding he would ""never, ever, ever"" get his career back. Speaking outside court, Mr Armstrong said: ""My whole life has been turned upside down. For a year I have not slept or eaten, and I was innocent. ""Were it not for the fact that crucial evidence was disclosed to my defence team just eight working days before trial, there could well have been yet another miscarriage of justice in this case."" Mr Armstrong and his lawyers refused to elaborate on what evidence he was referring to, but the court heard the woman at first refused to let police access her mobile phone and medical records. In messages recovered from the device, she said she had contacted a journalist hours after the alleged attack to get a ""sympathetic"" portrayal of her story. Her medical notes contained details of a history of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. Mr Armstrong has been suspended from his job in the wake of the allegations coming out."

President Trump had threatened to withhold billions of dollars in aid for countries that voted against America. Forecasters had predicted at least 150 nations would back the non-binding resolution, suggesting Mr Trump's threat had some impact. The countries which joined the US and Israel in voting against it were Togo, Palau, Micronesia, Honduras, Guatemala, Marshall Islands and Nauru. The UK backed the resolution, while Canada abstained. Another 21 countries were absent for vote including Kenya, Georgia and Ukraine. The resolution, which was largely symbolic, ""affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded."" A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas hailed the result as ""a victory for Palestine"". But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded the UN a ""house of lies"" and said the resolution was ""preposterous"". Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said America had been ""singled out for attack in the General Assembly of exercising our right as a sovereign nation"". ""We will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world's largest contribution to the United Nations, and so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit,"" she said. #UNGA adopts resolution on status of Jerusalem.

Mr Trump's decision earlier this month to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognise it as the capital triggered protests across the Muslim world and drew strong international condemnation. Prime Minister Theresa May condemned the move as ""wrong"", despite the president's promise it would help bring stability to the region."
2017-12-21,Dog owners have been warned against the dangers of leaving chocolate within reach of greedy canines over the festive period.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171221233940/https://news.sky.com/story/keep-deadly-chocolates-away-from-dogs-owners-warned-11179341,"Vets are preparing for a spike in chocolate poisoning around Christmas, as treats become more accessible in homes at this time of year. Research published in Vet Record reveals advent calendars, Santa Claus figurines and gift box selections are among the confectionery most likely to be devoured by dogs. One pooch got its paws on six Chocolate Oranges and six Toblerones, while another was treated for poisoning after gulping down a hot chocolate drink. Chocolate contains theobromine, a stimulant similar to caffeine, which dogs cannot process the same way as humans. The theobromine builds up toxic levels in their system and can cause vomiting, increased heart rate, agitation and seizures. Researchers at the University of Liverpool found that between 2012 and 2017, 386 cases of chocolate poisoning involving 375 animals were reported at almost 230 veterinary practices across the UK. Dogs are four times more likely to eat chocolate around Christmas and almost twice as likely at Easter than in non-festive periods. The PDSA charity says Narla, a French bulldog puppy, nearly died last December after eating a box of chocolate liqueurs from under the Christmas tree. She received life-saving treatment after being rushed to the vets. PDSA vet Terry Ogdin said: ""We estimated that Narla had eaten around 200g of chocolate, which is an extremely dangerous amount for a dog of her size. ""Thankfully she was brought in very quickly and we were able to treat her before the chocolate had a chance to digest."" Bailey, a 13-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier, needed urgent treatment after devouring two large milk chocolate and hazelnut bars last month, but has since made a full recovery. Veterinary researcher Dr Peter-John Mantyla Noble, who led the University of Liverpool study, said: ""People should keep festive chocolates away from pets. ""If chocolate is consumed, owners should talk to their vet as soon as possible, and ideally be prepared to quantify the amount and type of chocolate consumed."""

The local authority has told Trump International Golf Links (TGIL) that it can construct two sea defences of 630 metres and 260 metres in length. The coastal erosion management scheme involves the erection of man-made dunes along a 1km stretch of the coastline. Environmental groups had raised numerous objections, claiming the wall could damage protected wildlife habitats in the region. Protesters were quick to highlight the irony of a president, who is sceptical about climate change, building a wall in an attempt to manage coastal erosion. The original application cited global warming and rising seas as justification for the wall. Trump Hotels estimates that between 15 and 20 metres of dune facing the edge of the golf course has eroded in the last 15 years. In a statement, the local authority said: ""Clare County Council has today issued a decision to grant permission for the development of coastal erosion management works at, and adjacent to, Carrowmore Dunes, White Strand, Doughmore Bay and Trump International Golf Links and Hotel, Doonbeg, County Clare."" Under the Planning Act, the ruling may be subject to a first or third party appeal within a four-week period. Joe Russell, general manager of Trump Doonbeg, said: ""This decision demonstrates the Council's commitment to support local business and protect the economic future of the region. ""Trump Doonbeg will continue to engage with all stakeholders throughout the construction process."" Controversial plans for a 4.5 metre rock wall, running 2.8km along the beach, were scaled back last year."

""It was not his intention to cause distress, and Mr Garnier has apologised unreservedly to the individual. ""On that basis the Prime Minister considers that a line should be drawn under the issue."" The Cabinet Office investigation was launched in October after married father-of-three Mr Garnier conceded some of his actions ""look like dinosaur behaviour"". But he strongly denied that it constituted sexual harassment. :: MP's aide cleared of rape in Commons office:: PM sacks deputy after porn allegations inquiry He claimed his reference to ex-aide Caroline Edmondson as ""sugar t***"" was part of ""an amusing conversation"" based on TV comedy Gavin & Stacey, which uses the phrase. And he described asking Ms Edmondson to buy sex toys as ""good-humoured high jinks"" after a Christmas lunch. Mr Garnier said he told her he did not think it was a good idea. Ms Edmondson, who stopped working for the MP shortly after the incidents in 2010, disputed Mr Garnier's version of events, telling the Mail on Sunday earlier this year: ""He has lied."" She told Sky News on Thursday that Mr Garnier had since written her a letter apologising and that she hoped her actions would encourage young people at risk of intimidation in Parliament to speak out. Ms Edmondson said: ""I do feel very, very strongly that I've seen and witnessed a lot of awful bullying of younger people in Westminster. ""I'm hoping that if I speak out we'll get a proper HR department and the things that happened to me will not happen again."" She added: ""I just think it's too easy - I think the problem with MPs and Parliament is they have a huge amount of power and if they decide what's going to happen, that they'll normally find a way to make it happen."" Mr Garnier's behaviour was revealed at the height of the Westminster harassment scandal, which has seen several Tory and Labour MPs suspended. The investigation's conclusion comes after Prime Minister Theresa May lost her long-standing friend and political ally Damian Green. He was sacked as First Secretary of State - her de facto deputy - for ""misleading"" statements about his knowledge of claims pornography was found on his parliamentary computer."

Scotland Yard has announced it referred former assistant commissioner Bob Quick and retired officer Neil Lewis to privacy watchdog the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). It said there were concerns over possible breaches of data protection laws. Mr Green resigned on Wednesday night, after being asked to stand down by Mrs May for making two ""misleading"" statements about knowledge of the claims there was porn found on his office computer.

He has been named by Sky's Alistair Bunkall as Stanislav Yezhov, the official translator for the Ukrainian Prime Minister. Ukraine's security service, the SBU, says he was recruited by the Russians while working abroad. He previously served in the Ukrainian Embassy in the United States. Bunkall said he was told Mr Yezhov was in the room with Theresa May for private bilateral talks last July because the Ukrainian PM does not speak good English. ""Bilateral meetings are an opportunity for leaders to be frank and honest with one another in a way they wouldn't be in public. I understand Theresa May and her Ukrainian counterpart discussed sanctions against Russia and British military support to Ukraine, amongst other things. ""It's not inconceivable that Theresa May revealed how far Britain was or wasn't willing to go in its support for Ukraine. This sort of detail could be very valuable to Moscow,"" he said. Mrs May, when asked if she was concerned about reports of a Russian spy she was photographed alongside in Downing Street, said: ""I'm aware of the reports in relation to the Ukrainian individual who attended Downing Street earlier in the summer. ""The action that has been taken is a matter for the Ukrainian authorities.""

It came as the Press Association reported bizarre scenes in the Commons earlier when a mystery man was ejected from the public gallery for ""filming and taking pictures"" during a debate on Russian interference in UK politics. A spokesman for Theresa May said he was unable to talk about ""security matters"". But he added: ""Security in Downing Street is kept permanently under review.

The office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards did not give any more details. In 2016, the Leicester East MP publicly apologised to his wife and children and quit as chairman of the influential Commons Home Affairs Committee following reports in the Sunday Mirror that he paid two male escorts. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen called on Mr Vaz to resign as an MP. He tweeted: ""I instigated the complaint into Keith Vaz in Sept 2016. If more than 15 months later he is not fit to be held to the standards expected of a Parliamentarian, then he's not fit enough to be a Parliamentarian and we should be expecting a by-election in Leicester East."" There is no information on Mr Vaz's website that suggests he may be too ill to take part in the ongoing inquiry. On 14 December, he released a statement on keithvazmp.com saying he had been making efforts to secure a permanent receptionist for a Leicester hospital. His last public appearance reported on by his local paper the Leicester Mercury was in October when he attended the city's Diwali festival. The Guido Fawkes political website reported on 5 December that Mr Vaz had been discharged from his position on the International Trade Select Committee, just three months after he joined. The website at the time claimed he had not voted since 18 October. The TheyWorkForYou website says Mr Vaz voted on 12 September on tax changes and on 13 December on EU Withdrawal bill amendments, but was absent for many other votes between. The Public Whip website says that since the current parliament began, on 9 June, he had participated in 22 votes out of 78, a rate of 28%. The MP is known to suffer from diabetes. The Sunday Mirror reported that Mr Vaz had a conversation regarding cocaine with one of the male escorts he paid, in which he said he did not want to use the drug but indicated he would pay for it for the other man at a later date. In December 2016, Scotland Yard dropped an investigation into Mr Vaz over the allegations. The probe by the standards commissioner Kathryn Hudson was expected to determine whether Mr Vaz was guilty of a conflict of interest as he headed the Home Affairs Committee's review of vice laws at the time. The watchdog was also looking into whether the former Europe minister had caused ""significant damage"" to the reputation of Parliament."

Greyfriars will now be a ""scheduled monument"", meaning special consent will be needed before any changes could be made. Richard III was hastily buried after his death at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. He was reburied in 2015 at Leicester Cathedral. :: Public Parade For Richard III's Skeleton Archaeologists believe the site, which has been called ""one of the most significant in our national history"", is well preserved and could yield more archaeological remains. Although parts of the site have been built on, most of it has remained gardens or car parks, all close to the council's buildings. The site dates back to the 1220s, when Franciscan friars set up their church, which was where Richard III's body was originally laid to rest. It is believed the friary was knocked down when Henry Tudor, who became King Henry VIII after the battle, broke with the Catholic Church in Rome. Heritage minister John Glen described the discovery of Richard's remains ""an extraordinary archaeological find and an incredible moment in British history"". He added: ""By protecting this site as a scheduled monument, we are ensuring that the remains of this once lost medieval friary buried under Leicester are preserved for future generations."" The protection status was granted by the Culture Department on the advice of government heritage agency Historic England."

2017-12-21,Philip Hammond has received a small dose of Christmas cheer after official figures showed public borrowing edged lower last month.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171221233940/https://news.sky.com/story/borrowing-fall-delivers-christmas-cheer-for-hammond-11179765,"The Chancellor remains broadly on track to deliver his annual fiscal target after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said borrowing fell by £200m to £8.7bn - beating expectations that it would remain unchanged at £8.9bn. But economists said Mr Hammond faced a tough challenge ahead in improving public finances - in the wake of last month's official Budget forecasts that painted a bleak picture for coming years. Robust income tax revenue in November, 6% higher than a year ago, helped boost the Treasury's coffers - at a time when, while pay growth is being squeezed, unemployment is continuing to fall. VAT receipts rose too, partly helped by the uptick in inflation, and the numbers were also flattered by a change to the way public housing bodies are classified. The public finance figures are the first since Mr Hammond's autumn giveaway Budget last month - when he abolished stamp duty for first time buyers spending up to £300,000. At the same time, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cut growth expectations and pencilled in an extra £30bn in borrowing over the next four years. Britain's economic growth has been slowing this year, which has been largely attributed to the vote last year to leave the European Union. That is because the pound's value collapsed after the referendum, pushing up the costs of imports and driving inflation higher - resulting in a squeeze on consumer spending. But tax revenues have proved more resilient than first expected, and the OBR last month cut its borrowing forecast for the 2017/18 financial year from £58.3bn to £49.9bn. For the financial year to date, borrowing now stands at £48.1bn, though that is before a seasonal surplus expected in January. The borrowing figures come a day after the International Monetary Fund suggested Britain should look at raising taxes in order to drive down borrowing. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The Chancellor can go on his Christmas vacation content that the public finances have weathered the economy's slowdown well this year. ""But with slow growth likely to persist next year and little margin for error now left to meet fiscal rules, it's unlikely that the Chancellor will be able to soften his fiscal plans materially further again."" Investec's Victoria Clarke said: ""Philip Hammond's goal of balancing the books in the medium term remains a challenging one."""

The second, more formal picture, shows them sat together holding hands. Kensington Palace later released a third image, which they described as a ""candid photograph"", to thank the public for the ""warm and generous messages they have received during such a happy time in their lives"". The pictures were taken earlier this week at Frogmore House in Windsor by fashion photographer Alexi Lubomirski. He said: ""It was an incredible honour to be asked to document this wonderful evening, but also a great privilege to be invited to share and be a witness to this young couple's love for one another. ""I cannot help but smile when I look at the photos that we took of them, such was their happiness together."" The tradition means they have followed Harry's parents, who released their engagement photos in 1981, and his older brother William, who released images with Catherine in 2010. Harry and Ms Markle announced their engagement after months of speculation, and will be married in Windsor in May next year. The couple met through a mutual friend and bonded over a shared love of humanitarian work. Speaking about the moment he proposed in an interview last month, Ms Markle, 36, said she was so excited, she barely let him finish before she asked if she could say yes. She said: ""(It was) just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee. ""As a matter of fact I could barely let you finish proposing, I said - 'can I say yes now'?"" Harry, 33, asked Ms Markle's parents for her hand before he proposed. The American actress has been welcomed into the Royal Family quickly, joining the Queen for the annual Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday. She will also be spending Christmas with the Royals, as a guest of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Harry and Ms Markle have set the date of 19 May for their wedding, which has presented an awkward diary clash for his older brother, as it is the same day as the FA Cup final. Prince William, as the chairman of the FA, is meant to be on hand to present the winners with the trophy. Few details of the day have been released yet, but the couple are keen to make sure the public can be involved in some way."

Four of those hurt - including a young child - have been critically injured. Police have deployed a homicide squad. :: Melbourne witnesses recount the horror: 'People were flying' The area is now in lock-down and officers have warned people to stay away, however they have said the situation is contained and there is no ongoing threat. Premiere of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, described it as ""an act of evil and an act of cowardice, perpetrated against innocent bystanders."" Victoria police chief Shane Patton said investigators have found no evidence to suggest a link with terrorism. Pictures from the scene show the vehicle with a crumpled bonnet crashed into a bollard at a cable car stop. Witnesses said there were ""people flying everywhere"", with the crowd rushing to help the injured lying on the road. Victoria state police say they have arrested the driver of the vehicle after it ""collided with a number of pedestrians"" in the city centre. The driver was a 32-year old Australian of Afghan descent, who was known to police for previous historical assault matters. He is understood to have both drug and mental health issues, and is currently receiving treatment. The second man arrested was a 24-year-old who was filming the attack on his phone. He was carrying a bag containing three knives, but is not believed to be connected to the attack and police say they have not established any relationship between the two men. Speaking at a news conference, Commander Russell Barrett said that while the motive for the incident was not yet clear, police ""believe it was a deliberate act"". Footage shot on a mobile phone at the scene shows the driver, with dark hair and a close-cropped beard, being wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by officers. A member of the public can be heard telling police ""he was trying to run away"". The man, who is wearing a white shirt and pale blue jeans, appears to be unconscious as he lies on by the side of the road. Officers can be seen checking his pulse, and trying to revive him as they turn him onto his back by slapping his face. They can also be seen checking his jean pockets. The white SUV can be seen in the middle of the road with its passenger door wide open and its air bags deployed. The front of the car is completely crushed. The second man, who was wearing jeans, a dark t-shirt and trainers, was arrested by officers on the steps of the station and can be seen lying on his side as three officers handcuff him. Injured people can also be seen lying on the road being helped by members of the public, while sirens blare in the background as paramedics approach. People at the scene have been described as ""running towards"" the injured on the ground the moment the incident took place. At the time of the crash, the area was packed with Christmas shoppers including children, who have now finished school for their holiday break. Reports differ as to the speed at which the car was travelling, with some describing it as not travelling fast, while others say it was travelling at around 60mph (97kph). Witnesses told Sky News the car ran through a red traffic light in a 25mph (40kph) speed limit zone, before it began running into pedestrians. A witness told radio station 3AW that she heard screams and saw ""people flying everywhere"". ""We could hear this noise, as we looked left, we saw this white car, it just mowed everybody down,"" she said. ""We heard thump, thump, thump. People are running everywhere."" Commuters were warned to get off trams near the area following the crash. It is not known whether the incident is terror-related. The area, which has been designated as a crime scene, has been closed off to the public while investigations take place. Reacting to the news, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull tweeted: ""As our federal & state police & security agencies work together to secure the scene and investigate this shocking incident our thoughts & prayers are with the victims & the emergency & health workers who are treating them."" As our federal & state police & security agencies work together to secure the scene and investigate this shocking incident our thoughts & prayers are with the victims & the emergency & health workers who are treating them. https://t.co/JkUM9TuIQe British High Commissioner to Australia Menna Rawlings tweeted, saying her ""Thoughts are with all affected"". The England cricket squad, who are in Melbourne for the Boxing Day Ashes Test, also tweeted: ""Following the Flinders Street incident in Melbourne, all England players and management have been accounted for and are safe."" The fourth Test will be held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground around one mile (1.6km) away from the scene of the incident. Victoria Police are asking witnesses to contact them, and have urged anyone with images or video footage of the incident to upload it to their website: http://australiauploadserviceweb.cloudapp.net. Following the Flinders Street incident in Melbourne, all England players and management have been accounted for and are safe. Police will be putting hundreds of extra officers on the streets over the coming days, but have stressed that there is ""no increased threat"" to the public. The combination of Christmas shopping and cricket crowds mean that Melbourne city centre will be especially busy over the next week. In January, six people were killed and more than 30 injured just a few hundred metres away when a car ran into pedestrians in a busy shopping area. The car was deliberately driven at crowds by a man with a history of drug abuse, family violence and mental health issues. That incident was not terrorism-related."

An overwhelming 75% of those asked said she should continue to campaign, while 11% said she should not and 15% said they didn't know. With the countdown to their wedding under way, there is lots of anticipation that Ms Markle will bring something different to the Royal Family. In the past, the American actress hasn't been afraid to share her political views and speak out on issues like women's political participation and Donald Trump, who she described as misogynistic ahead of the US presidential elections. Those who know her charity work say she is a passionate and committed advocate for causes that really matter to her. Lara Dewar from World Vision in Canada went to India with Meghan and told Sky News: ""What made her very unique was how educated she already was on the issues, she wasn't joining or jumping on a bandwagon, she wasn't doing it because it somehow benefited her profile, in fact she made it very clear that she knew she had a little bit of influence and wanted to use her platform to better the lives of others."" Marrying into Britain's hereditary constitutional monarchy will take some adjusting to for Harry's future wife. Meghan has already said she is going to become a UK citizen, but members of the Royal Family do not vote and are expected to remain politically neutral. She is now being supported by Prince Harry's team who will help guide her through the sensitivities of promoting issues that some may see as political, but without commenting on political policy. Peter Tatchell, the human rights campaigner, told Sky News: ""When Royals express political opinions and opinions on social issues it can lead to problems and tensions. ""In the past King Edward VIII did express views or actions which were seen to be appeasing of the Nazis. On the other hand Princess Diana did very laudable work supporting people with HIV and action against landmines. ""So it all depends on your political perspective or your conscience whether you think what these Royals are saying is okay and par the course, or whether you think it is an unjustified intrusion into political debate."" Meghan is as much marrying into a new family as an institution with rules and constraints. She won't be the first person to navigate her way through what you can and can't say as a member of the House of Windsor. Prince Philip in the early days was seen as too radical and modern by some, and Prince Charles has been criticised by those who claim he uses his position to lobby Government ministers - most notably through his so-called ""black spider memos"" - notes written to Government departments in the Prince's sprawling handwriting. On Thursday, Meghan joined the Royal Family's annual Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace hosted by the Queen. Her husband-to-be, Prince Harry, was pictured driving a Land Rover Discovery as he arrived at the palace on Wednesday. Meghan was sitting in the passenger seat as they passed waiting photographers. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, also arrived for the lunch in a separate car.

But, following a series of talks, the PPF said it had secured acceptable commitments from Toys R Us that enabled it to support the so-called Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). Sky News had reported exclusively on the ebbs and flows in the negotiations in the days and hours ahead of the meeting - with the result on a knife-edge until the announcement. The firm had said early this month that it wanted to shut 26 stores - a quarter of its UK total - with the loss of hundreds of jobs, under a plan to save substantial costs and modernise its business model. It sought the CVA to achieve this but it needed the support of 75% of creditors, including landlords and the PPF. The body, known as the pensions lifeboat and which held a 20% weighting in the vote, said it had now got a deal that went a long way to meeting its initial fund shortfall concerns. :: Why it is not fun and games at Toys R Us It said after the meeting: ""The company has agreed to pay £9.8m into the pension plan, composed of £3.8m in 2018, with a further £6m promised over 2019 and 2020. ""The deal also sees the pension deficit recovery plan shortened to ten years, while the company has undertaken to seek additional support from the US parent company for the new plan for the pension scheme. ""Furthermore the trustees will have greater powers if any of the above conditions are not met."" The CVA achieved 98% support. Steve Knights, the UK managing director of Toys R Us UK, said: ""We are pleased to have secured the support of our creditors and will be working closely with them in the months ahead. ""The vote in favour of the CVA represents strong support for our Business Plan and provides us with the platform we need to transform our business so that we can better serve our customers today and long into the future."" ""All of our stores across the UK will remain open for business as normal until Spring 2018. ""Customers can continue to shop online and there will be no changes to our returns policies or gift cards across this period. ""As part of the CVA proposal, a number of stores have been identified for closure. Consultations with employees will commence in the New Year."""

Birmingham was the only city bidding for the event, having emerged as Britain's candidate over Liverpool. The games, which have an estimated budget of £750m, were last held in the UK in 2014, when they took place in Glasgow. Birmingham is the replacement host city for Durban, South Africa, which was stripped of the event over financial problems. The Games federation initially said the Midlands city's plans were not ""fully compliant"", but they have since been approved. Ms Martin CBE said: ""With its rich history, cultural diversity, youthful dynamism and ambitious spirit, Birmingham embodies all that we cherish about the Commonwealth."" Even if Birmingham was the only city to submit a bid, it has had to wait three months to have its victory confirmed. The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) extended its deadline by two months to November to encourage more bids, but they did not materialise. It is understood that the federation also had some concerns over the city's bid, particularly over the Government's pledge to finance 75% of the £750m bill and the city council's plan to raise the remainder. Birmingham has been at the centre of a dispute about female council staff's pay and seen rubbish build up in its streets in a battle with binmen over pay, but is understood to have given assurances to the Government and the Commonwealth federation. The city council hopes to create an athlete's village in Perry Barr, home to Alexandra Stadium, which will be expanded to host the events and ceremonies. Victoria Square will be used for 3x3 Basketball and Wheelchair Basketball. The only new venue in the bid is the Sandwell Aquatics Centre, set to host Swimming, Para Swimming and Diving."
2017-12-21,"In the Commons last week, the Tory MP Nick Boles congratulated Theresa May on ""a performance worthy of Geoffrey Boycott"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171221233940/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-bats-away-her-opponents-attacks-11179258,"In reply, during a Q&A session on Brexit that lasted two-and-a-half hours, the Prime Minister said: ""I regard any reference to Geoffrey Boycott as a compliment."" Nine days later, in her final appearances before MPs before Christmas, the PM played the political equivalent of a T20 bash and a gruelling Test match in the same day. Not only did she face MPs at the regular Wednesday session of PMQs, but then she had to spend nearly two hours answering more questions from the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. As cricket fans of a certain age will know, Geoffrey Boycott wore glasses during the early part of his career. And now, at the Liaison Committee, the PM wore hers for the first time in the Commons. :: May clashes with MPs over Brexit ratification PMQs is like a T20 cricket match: a fast pace, attempts to leave the PM stumped, while she aims to hit the Leader of the Opposition for six, or at least swat him to the boundary. The Liaison Committee, however, is more like a Test match, a long and slow war of attrition, with the PM's interrogators taking their time with a few looseners before attempting to have her caught out with an unplayable bouncer or googly. At PMQs, the Prime Minister was made to look like an Australian batsman, feasting on Jeremy Corbyn's rather one-paced attacks on the Government's record on the NHS. Taunting the Labour leader, Mrs May said: ""Not that long ago he was saying he would be Prime Minister by Christmas. Well, he was wrong. I am, and the Conservatives are in Government. ""Not that long ago he said we wouldn't deliver on phase one of the Brexit negotiations. Well he was wrong - we've made sufficient progress and we're moving on to phase two of the Brexit negotiations. ""And not that long ago he predicted that the Budget would be a failure. In fact the Budget was a success and it's delivering more money for our National Health Service. ""Labour wrong, wrong, wrong. Conservatives in government, delivering on Brexit, a Budget for homes and the health service."" Mr Corbyn tried coming round the wicket with a Christmas pun. ""Twelve thousand patients were kept waiting in the back of an ambulance because there was no room at the A&E."" The delivery that unsettled the PM the most came from the Labour MP Clive Efford, who told MPs: ""Last year, the Prime Minister told the Radio Times that on Christmas Day she likes to prepare and cook her own goose. ""In the spirit of Christmas can I suggest to her that in order to extract the maximum pleasure from the messy job of stuffing her goose that she names it either Michael or Boris?"" This time Mrs May looked stumped, until Philip Hammond - sitting next to her - leaned forward and prompted her and she said: ""Can I say to him I think I'll be having to resist the temptation to call the goose Jeremy."" The Liaison Committee is made up of the MPs who chair the Commons select committees and is supposed to quiz the PM three or four times a year, though this was Theresa May's first appearance before it for a year. This hearing had none of the frivolity of PMQs and was a low-scoring affair until it came to life with some sledging between the Prime Minister and her old foe, Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee. Ms Cooper asked: ""Now that Dominic Grieve's amendment has been passed, can you confirm there will be a vote on statute before a withdrawal agreement is ratified?"" The PM replied that there had to be an agreement before there could be a withdrawal agreement bill. ""But will the vote on primary legislation take place before the treaty is ratified?"" Ms Cooper snapped back. Putting on her weary, exasperated voice, Mrs May said there would be two votes, on a resolution and on the bill. ""But will MPs vote on the bill before ratification?"" said Ms Cooper. Parliament would have a vote, the PM replied. ""But will Parliament vote on a statute, rather than a motion, before ratification? The Government has ignored motions."" Mrs May said the Government would look at the Grieve amendment, but she wanted Parliament to have a meaningful vote. ""It is the bill that will ensure the agreement becomes law,"" she added. ""But will that be before ratification?"" came another bouncer. Clearly irritated by now, Mrs May said: ""It depends what bit of ratification you are talking about. Parliament cannot vote on an agreement before there is one."" In a hearing lasting an hour and 45 minutes, an hour and 10 minutes was taken up by questions on Brexit, from nine MPs. That meant there was little time for planned questions on social care, tackling injustices and sexual harassment. But at the end, just as the PM must have thought she had successfully batted out time for a draw, she became embroiled in a clash with the umpire, Sarah Wollaston, the Tory MP who chairs the Liaison Committee. Ms Wollaston told the PM her committee was unhappy that the Government's national security adviser, Mark Sedwill, is refusing to give evidence to the Defence Select Committee. The PM turned defence into attack, declaring that ministers are accountable to Parliament and the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, or his permanent secretary should appear instead. That was a no-ball as far as Ms Wollaston was concerned. And we haven't heard the last of this dispute. But despite many predictions that she would be given out before the end of 2017, Theresa May remains unbeaten and still at the wicket at the end of the year. And as this Christmas double - her personal T20 and Test - confirmed, the PM remains difficult to prise out, in both the long and short forms of the political game. Just like her hero Geoffrey Boycott, in fact."

As Dr Strangelove himself puts it: ""Of course, the whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh?"" The UK has been telling the world about its deterrent cyberweapon program since at least 2011, when it first acknowledged the program. Since then, we've seen numerous and devastating hacks from nation states including Russia, Iran and North Korea. One wonders how effective that UK deterrent has been. So the UK has decided to tell the world about its cyberweapons again. Boris Johnson has told the Russians that we will retaliate against cyberattacks. And in the Intelligence and Security Committee's annual review of the intelligence agencies, published this week, GCHQ said it was developing a ""full spectrum"" of offensive capabilities. GCHQ said that ranged from ""technical stuff... right through to what we would say is the high end of counter-state offensive cybercapabilities which might never be used, and everything in between."" What might those weapons look like in real life? The Times reports techniques including ""the ability to make another country's warplanes, ships and missiles malfunction and to infect a mobile phone to suck up information or wipe the memory"". In fact, we've seen examples of exactly that - from the Russians. Hacking into phones is on the low end of what nation-states are capable of. But in June, ships in the Black Sea were sent off course because their GPS signals were spoofed. Many systems - including missiles and drones - rely on GPS (although not entirely). Or take power stations. Ukraine's power grid has been shut down by cyberattacks twice in the last two years. Officials there have blamed Russia for the sabotage. For an example of what a Western cyberweapon might be capable of, you need to look, counter-intuitively, at North Korea. This week, the UK and USA officially blamed it for the Wannacry ransomware attack which spread rapidly around the world earlier this year. But its fearsome success was partly because it used tools developed by the US National Security Agency. Those tools were stolen, leaked publicly, then exploited by the North Koreans. The UK's cyber arsenal should at least match those capabilities, given GCHQ's expertise and funding levels."

It successfully propelled 10 satellites into orbit an hour later. The rocket first appeared as a red light which looked more like an unusual coloured star. As it gathered height Californians were in awe as they saw a streak of light streaming across the clear sky at sunset. Several celebrities joined fellow social media users in questioning what the mysterious light was. Singers will.i.am and Billy Ray Cyrus asked what the streak was.

Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), warned: ""He's overweight and all of us do our bit to add to his obesity by leaving mince pies and cookies for him and milk or alcohol. ""He may have gout, he may have alcoholism - there's a real bit of binge drinking going on."" She said: ""There are also issues with sleep deprivation, work stress, his mental health."" Father Christmas' nine reindeer - Rudolph, Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen - are also a cause for concern as they could be carrying ticks infested with the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Professor Stokes-Lampard said that if Santa was her patient she would recommend he ""gives the sherry a miss this year - and maybe asks Rudolph if he can share his carrots"". On a more serious note, she said that many people tend to overindulge when it comes to alcohol during the festive period. ""Santa is almost certainly living with multiple morbidities which, if left untreated, can become increasingly distressing and debilitating,"" Professor Stokes-Lampard said. ""If Mr Claus was a patient at my practice, I would be encouraging him to adopt a vastly healthier diet and take more exercise in the new year. ""I'd also be keen to address his binge drinking, something which many people - perhaps even unknowingly - tend to do while celebrating Christmas. ""The human body can only process one unit of alcohol per hour, which means excessive consumption could make Santa drunk very quickly. ""This not only increases the likelihood of him slipping in the snow or mixing up important presents, but could also lead to long-term issues affecting his mood and mental health."" Meanwhile, new research by Skinny Lager estimates that on Christmas Eve Santa will be served an estimated 8.3 billion calories in the UK alone, including more than nine million mince pies and 16 million glasses of sherry. Over a fifth in the UK think alcohol contributes to 30% or more of their entire calorie intake over the Christmas period, it was found."

The 26-year-old was charged on Friday with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, and faces 20 years in prison if convicted. He said he wanted to carry out a violent attack on Pier 39 in San Francisco because it was heavily crowded, according to an FBI affidavit. Jameson, now a tow-truck driver, said he ""did not need an escape plan because he was ready to die"". Pier 39 is one of San Francisco's most popular tourist destinations and is home to numerous restaurants, bars and souvenir shops, as well as the city's aquarium. Jameson was under surveillance and ""the public was never in imminent danger"", FBI spokeswoman Katherine Zackel said. The truck driver posted extremist messages online, with some supporting the Halloween terror attack in New York City when a truck driver rammed into pedestrians, killing eight, the FBI said. He had offered to use his tow truck for an attack. The FBI started investigating in mid-September after Jameson liked posts supporting IS. He ""loved"" an online post showing Father Christmas threatening to attack New York with a box of dynamite. On Wednesday agents raided his home where they found a suicide note signed with an Islamic variation of his name with his last will and testament, updated in November. Fireworks, two rifles and a 9mm handgun were also found. During the search Jameson ""stated his support of ISIS and terrorism and discussed aspects of the plan to carry out an attack, noting that he would be happy if an attack was carried out"". In 2009 he took part in Marine basic recruit training and earned a sharpshooter rifle qualification but was discharged for failing to disclose a history of asthma. In comments to undercover agents he said: ""I have been trained in combat and things of war."" Two years ago Jameson converted to Islam. Attorney general Jeff Sessions said: ""The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is real - and it is serious."" He said federal agents are protecting the nation from ""an alleged plot to kill Americans""."

He receives information, or referrals, fed in from the authorities, charities and the public about where rough sleepers are in the London borough of Lewisham, and approaches them to help them find shelter. ""Sometimes I think that it's a losing battle... sometimes I don't know where to start, maybe in one night I go through eight, nine, 10 referrals. ""We need more support, that's what we need. I think by next year we're going to have more people on the streets,"" he said. :: Govt accused of 'unacceptable complacency' on homelessness in damning report ""We've got a lot of young people on the street at the moment, most of them it's because of relationship breakdown in the family and benefit problems."" It comes as homelessness charity Housing Justice says Government welfare reforms and soaring rents have resulted in a growing number of employed people ending up homeless and in night shelters. Jacob Quagliozzi, the organisation's director for England, told Sky News the group's nationwide network of more than 100 church and community centre night shelters now regularly accommodate working people. ""If you went back 10 years and spoke to shelter projects it would be rare that you would have people in those shelter projects who worked. ""Now it's actually quite common - so that's a relatively new occurrence, but also the effect of welfare reform, particularly in some cases Universal Credit contributing to an increase in shelter numbers."" :: Celebs join 'world's biggest sleepout' A damning National Audit Office report in September suggested a sharp rise in homelessness was fuelled by increasing private rents and cuts in housing benefits. Official statistics show there has been a 132% increase in the number of people sleeping rough in England since 2010. That is based on the Government estimate that more than 4,000 people are on the streets at any given point, but the charity Crisis says the true figure could now be closer to 9,000.The number of households accepted as homeless by local authorities dropped dramatically between 2003 and 2009, but while the overall number remains well below the 2003 peak, there has been a 62% increase in homeless households since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. More than 120,000 children are currently in temporary accommodation as a result of their families being deemed homeless, which is an increase of 65% since 2010.While factors such as parents no longer being able to offer accommodation and relationship breakdowns remain common, since 2010 the number of people made homeless after being unable to afford a new lease at the end of a private rental tenancy has rocketed - making it by the far the single biggest contributor to homelessness. In the recent Budget, the Chancellor committed to providing more than £1bn by 2020 to reduce all forms of homelessness, with the aim of halving rough sleeping by 2022, and eliminating it by 2027. Next year, the Homelessness Reduction Act will also come into force, which will place a greater emphasis on ensuring residents are aware of support available to them, and putting a greater onus on local authorities to prevent homelessness occurring in the first place. But while it welcomed the new legislation, London Councils, the group that represents all 32 London boroughs, has warned the money pledged by Government to fund these new prevention efforts goes ""nowhere near"" what councils need. Sir Steve Bullock, the executive member for housing at London Councils, told Sky News the capital will need an extra £77m a year to deliver on new obligations created by the Homelessness Prevention Act, but suggested money pledged by ministers will instead amount to around £73m over three years. ""It's the need to recruit staff, but also the cost of early intervention is getting people into situations where landlord does not evict them immediately before we find them somewhere else to go,"" he said. ""Any money helps, but to do this as well as it needs to be done, and there's no dispute that we all agree we need to do this, right now £73m over three years will go nowhere near what we need,"" he said. Volunteer efforts to assist homeless people are now becoming increasingly visible across the country. In London, a group of black cab drivers runs a project called 'Taxi Warm Clothing', which sees them donate sleeping bags, blankets and coats from their vehicles. Each Wednesday night they provide homeless people in Westminster with tea, coffee and leftover sandwiches donated by the food chain Eat. Anton Haynes, a black cab driver involved in the project, told Sky News his work meant he was confronted with the growing crisis every day. ""I've seen it grow. When I started driving a cab years ago there was always rough sleeping, but now it's everywhere, it's pretty much every doorway,"" he said. ""It's in the news all the time at the moment, but there's not enough money spent on the homelessness problem. ""Affordable housing is not affordable to these people, no way; it's not affordable to me. ""So more needs to be done without a doubt - this is just the tip of the iceberg."""

2017-12-23,The plight of Toys R Us UK is one that encapsulates many of the woes of traditional high street retailers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171224001929/https://news.sky.com/story/toys-r-us-not-alone-in-facing-string-of-challenges-in-retail-sector-11179623,"Online retailers have been able to sell toys more cheaply than it has been able to, thanks to not being burdened by overheads such as onerous property leases, business rates and Sunday trading laws, all of which hand online retailers a significant advantage. In the case of Toys R Us, it has also been hit by the loss in appeal of big out-of-town stores, in favour of smaller premises that can be used to showcase products that can then be bought on a ""click and collect"" basis. That is a problem that has not just afflicted Toys R Us but other rivals, notably Tesco, one of the pioneers in the field. As Steve Knights, the managing director of Toys R Us UK has admitted, the warehouse-style stores that it opened in the 1980s and 1990s, while successful in those days, ""are too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment"". Adding to the operation's woes has been the delay to the revaluation of business rates by the Government. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, announced in last month's Budget that, from next April, the rise in business rates will henceforth be indexed to the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rather than the higher Retail Prices Index. That reform is expected to save businesses £2.3bn during the next five years, while business rates will now be revalued every three years instead of every five years, making changes to rates less of a shock for retailers - like Toys R Us UK - that have large store estates. However, according to the property services company Colliers International, if this reform had been announced two years ago, it would have saved Toys R Us UK £17m. John Webber, the head of rating at Colliers International, told Property Week earlier this month: ""The stores in some parts of the country have been forced to pay for the better ones for far too long in terms of business rates. ""Taking the Exeter store as an example, the rates bill should have decreased by around 34%. But because of phasing, reductions have only been a small percentage this year and next. The business therefore will overpay in excess of £800,000 in business rates on that store alone. ""That's a lot of Barbies to sell."" Onto all of these woes can be overlaid the weak state of consumer confidence which, according to the latest figures published by research house GfK, has just slumped to its weakest level since December 2013. Confidence among British consumers has now been falling for almost two years and trading is said to have been weak across the high street since the rash of ""Black Friday"" promotions at the end of November. All this, according to the insolvency advisers Begbies Traynor, has put 43,677 retailers in ""significant financial distress"" - up by almost a quarter on December last year. The grocery wholesaler Palmer & Harvey has already gone under, with the loss of 3,000 jobs, while credit insurers - the crucial players that grease the wheels of the retail trade by protecting suppliers in the event of a retailer going bust before they get paid - are said to have reduced or, in some cases taken away entirely, cover for the electricals chain Maplins and the discount retailer Poundland. In the case of the latter, it is said to be trading well, but confidence among credit insurers has been rattled by problems in its South African parent Steinhoff, whose other UK assets include the furniture chains Bensons for Beds and Harveys. In the case of Toys R Us, there are also specific factors at play, not least the difficulties of its US parent company. It has debts totalling $5bn and filed for bankruptcy protection in September. Earlier this week, it reported that in the three months to October, it made a net loss of $623m after sales fell by nearly 5% - with like-for-like sales in the US down by 7%. The complex structure of Toys R Us, which has 17 subsidiaries including Toys R Us UK, may have contributed to the group's problems in Britain. There are said to be numerous inter-company loans in the business - which may help explain loans worth some £584.5m, that have apparently been written off, made by Toys R Us UK to a British Virgin Islands-based based entity. However, it is being suggested that rather than siphoning off money from the UK, other companies in the Toys R Us Group have been providing financial support to Toys R Us UK in the form of short term inter-company loans. On top of that, of course, is the pension fund - the issue that has brought to a head the crisis at Toys R Us UK. The pensions scheme at the business has a deficit of £30m. But, in order for the scheme to be tipped into the Pension Protection Fund lifeboat, the PPF is requiring Toys R Us UK to make a £9m contribution to the deficit. Toys R Us UK claims not to have the money while the wider Toys R Us Group claims it is unable to provide it due to its bankruptcy protection process. The pensions situation is also likely to be an issue hurting other UK retailers. A decade of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing has depressed the yield on UK government gilts - a key measure by which future pension liabilities are calculated. Pension deficits everywhere have been growing, obliging companies everywhere to pay more into their schemes, something that in particular has hit retailers employing large numbers of people. Toys R Us is extremely unlikely to be the last British retailer to experience turmoil this winter."

""It is with a heavy heart that we announce the sad news that after a short illness Gogglebox's Leon Bernicoff passed away in hospital earlier today,"" the statement said. ""Leon and his wife June were the first members of the public to be cast for Gogglebox back in early 2013, and they soon grew to become much-loved voices during the course of the show's 10 series to date. ""Leon's unique personality and sharp wit endeared him to fans of the show, as he contributed fully to Gogglebox's reputation as a programme full of warm humour and unvarnished opinion. ""To those of us that knew him personally, Leon was a man of unwavering principles who exerted a distinct paternal presence both on and off screen. He will be dearly missed by the entire Gogglebox family; cast and crew."" Bernicoff is survived by wife June, two daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren.

In a simple message to his fans: Sheeran said: ""Thank you very much for making Perfect Christmas number one. ""This is an actual dream come true and I'm very proud and happy. ""Thank you so much and have a very merry Christmas, happy holidays and a happy new year."" He released his third album, Divide, in March of this year and his music has dominated the charts throughout 2017. The first single, Shape Of You, was number one for 13 weeks, and did the double with the album itself when it was released. Nine of Divide's songs were in the top 10 at the same time at one point, with the rest of the album's tracks featuring somewhere in the top 20. When Castle On The Hill was released, he held the top spot and number two, and when Perfect was released, it gave his album a resurgence, giving him number one single and album. Streaming service Spotify revealed the singer is the most-streamed artist of the year and remains the most popular artist with 47m monthly listeners. This year, Sheeran has also headlined Glastonbury, which divided fans of the festival, and been awarded an MBE. He also appeared in an episode of Game of Thrones, but the backlash forced him off Twitter. A cycling accident led to him cancelling several shows after he broke his wrist, elbow and rib. Sheeran was named the third richest celebrity under 30 in the UK, and his personal fortune is thought to be £52m."

The sanctions include drastically lowering limits on North Korea's oil imports. Moments after the vote, the US President tweeted: ""The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional Sanctions on North Korea. ""The World wants Peace, not Death!"" The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional Sanctions on North Korea. The World wants Peace, not Death! The resolution also means all North Koreans working abroad must return home within two years, and there is a crackdown on ships smuggling banned items including coal and oil to the secretive country. In a break with the norm, both China and Russia joined Western nations in voting for sanctions. The Trump administration had sought harsher terms in the resolution, such as a ban on all oil imports, and the freezing of international assets, but they were not included. The resolution was drafted by US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, with China, but was criticised by other council members for the short period of time they had to consider them, and for some last-minute changes. :: Kim Jong Un celebrates missile launch with stroll on sacred mountain But Ms Haley said: ""The unity this council has shown in levelling these unprecedented sanctions is a reflection of the international outrage at the Kim regime's actions."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""I welcome the unanimous adoption of the UNSC resolution on North Korea. The international community has shown that it is united in its condemnation of North Korea's reckless behaviour. ""This resolution takes vital steps to reduce the export revenues that the North Korean regime diverts away from its people to fund its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. ""These further measures adopted show Kim Jong-Un that he has the choice of two paths. To either continue the current path of provocation and isolation or to put the wellbeing of the North Korean people first. We urge North Korea to change its course."" Britain's UN ambassador Matthew Rycroft said the Security Council is sending ""a very strong united signal to the North Korean regime that enough is enough, that they must stop their nuclear program and they must stop their intercontinental ballistic missile programme"". North Korea's crude oil imports will be capped at four million barrels a year, with refined oil products capped at 500,000 a year, representing a 90% ban on the products. It also faces new bans on exports including food products, machinery, and vehicles. North Korea's missile test on 29 November was its 20th this year, and added to fears that the country will soon have an arsenal capable of targeting the US mainland. Approximately 93,000 North Koreans are working abroad according to US estimates. They will all have to return by the end of 2019."

Blackamoor sculptures and jewellery usually depict an African or non-European male, as a servant. They have a complex history as they were once considered to be a tribute to the people they represented. The Princess' brooch appears to be the bust of an African person, wearing a crown and jewels. It has sparked particular outrage because of Ms Markle's mixed heritage. A spokesman for the Princess said: ""The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offence."" According to the Telegraph, a source added there was ""no malice"" intended in wearing the piece. Ms Markle has spoken openly on many occasions about being the daughter of a white father and a black mother and her engagement to Prince Harry has been seen as a huge marker for progress in the Royal Family. The connection did not go unnoticed on social media One Twitter user commented that the piece belonged in a museum, rather than on the Princess' lapel, while another called her an ""embarrassment"" to the Royal Family. Some defended her saying the pieces are not racist. Ms Markle was invited to attend the Queen's annual lunch on 20 December at Buckingham Palace after the couple announced their engagement at the end of November. Although they are not yet married, she will also be spending Christmas itself with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, an invitation the now Duchess of Cambridge did not receive until she and Prince William tied the knot."

But the Scottish Conservatives labelled the stunt ""utterly childish"". Mr Stevenson ordered the Cullen Skink pie's delivery to Whitehall in a bid to catch Mr Davis' attention about potential customs queues after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Stevenson, who represents Europe's biggest fishing port at Peterhead, said he hoped the minister would use Christmas to come up with a ""clear plan for exactly how he's going to protect Scotland's seafood sector"". He warned against ""Tory ineptitude"" and a no-deal divorce. ""Nor do we want to see lorry-loads of fresh, high-quality Scottish seafood waiting by the lorryload in queues at Dover for lengthy customs checks,"" Mr Stevenson said. ""It could compromise the freshness of the product - as David Davis might learn to his peril if he doesn't pick up his Christmas gift from me in time."" But the Scottish Tories said the stunt was a juvenile prank. A party spokesperson said: ""This is utterly childish from the SNP. Rather than pulling bizarre pranks they should start working constructively with the UK Government to get the best possible deal out of Brexit."" The issue of customs after Brexit has sparked passionate debate, after the CEO of Sainsbury's warned that strict controls on importing fresh food from Europe would leave it rotting at the border.

After talks between the pair finished, they appeared to exchange barbs in a news conference which, at times, grew tense. At one point, Mr Lavrov told reporters Mr Johnson had told him that Russia did not interfere in the EU referendum. ""Not successfully,"" Mr Johnson shot back. ""See, he has to say this so that he is not criticised back home, for his reputation,"" Mr Lavrov responded. ""It's your reputation I'm worried about, Sergei,"" Britain's most senior diplomat responded with a smile. The UK's Foreign Secretary insisted there was ""abundant evidence"" that Russia had attempted to influence polls in the US, Germany, Denmark and France. Theresa May had earlier promised that Mr Johnson would take a ""hard-headed"" approach to dealing with Russia when he travelled to Moscow for the first visit by a Foreign Secretary for five years. :: Boris Johnson arrives in Moscow for 'vital' talks with Russia After the talks, Mr Lavrov said the UK government made a series of aggressive and insulting statements. Mr Johnson was in Moscow in an attempt to open up communication channels after years of hostility. Before the talks got under way, he told Mr Lavrov: ""Things are difficult but we want to work together with you on some issues, Sergei, and we want to work to achieve a better future. ""We have a duty to work together for peace and security."" Afterwards, Mr Lavrov said the pair had discussed Libya, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and North Korea and had agreed to discuss the impact of Brexit on UK-Russia ties. He said they had also discussed Ukraine, but failed to say if anything had been agreed, other than that the two countries needed to work together in the UN Security Council. Mr Lavrov added that both countries' ability to tackle terrorism was constrained by the UK's refusal to fully cooperate with Russian security service FSB. Mr Johnson said the UK could not ignore events in Ukraine, Russian cyber activities and the plight of gay people in Chechnya as he admitted that UK-Russia relations were going through a ""very difficult patch"". Meanwhile, Mr Lavrov said he trusted the Foreign Secretary and was happy to call him by his first name. ""We are ready to develop dialogue on a very wide range of issues on the basis of principles of equality (and) taking into account and respecting each other's interests,"" Mr Lavrov said. The meeting comes a day after it emerged that a Ukrainian government translator who visited Downing Street with an official party has been arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia. Later day, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia must strive to be a leader in building a ""new generation"" army to protect its sovereignty and foreign policy, particularly near its borders. :: What would a cyberwar between the UK and Russia look like?"

Most of the deaths were in the provinces of Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur, and on the Zamboanga Peninsula, Romina Marasigan from the government's disaster response agency said. The death toll rose throughout Saturday as officials pulled dozens of bodies form a swollen river. One man was killed by a crocodile while securing his boat, police said. In the fishing village of Anungan, more than 30 people were swept away by flash floods. Sibuco town mayor Bong Edding said five bodies had been recovered so far. ""The floodwaters from the mountain came down so fast and swept away people and houses,"" Mr Edding said. ""It's really sad because Christmas is just a few days away. But these things happen beyond our control."" Mr Edding blamed the tragedy on years of logging in the mountains near Anungan, and said he and other officials would seek to halt logging operations. Emergency workers, soldiers, police and volunteers have been mobilised to search for survivors, clear debris, and restore power and communications. Thousands of people were moved to emergency shelters, while thousands more were stranded at air and sea ports. Ferries were stopped from going out in rough seas and flights were cancelled. One boat sank after being lashed by winds on Thursday night, leaving five people dead and 250 passengers rescued. The storm gathered strength over the Sulu Sea, bringing winds of up to 50mph, forecasters said. It was heading west and would be out over the sea later on Saturday, they added. The Philippines is hit by around 20 major storms each year on average, many of them fatal. The deadliest typhoon to hit the country was Haiyan, which killed 7,350 people and destroyed entire towns in heavily populated areas of the central Philippines in November 2013."

It's now a bit of a joke within her family that she arrived on Valentines Day with a broken heart. It has taken all year to try and fix it and that's meant she still hasn't made it home from hospital. Her mum, Kelly, told Sky News: ""She has had two major open heart surgeries already... it's been hard but we are still smiling because Amelia is still smiling. ""We could sit by her bedside 24/7 be really sad, be really miserable and ignore my other son who is 10 but we decided, both me and Dad decided that wouldn't be any life for anyone."" Amelia's diagnosis was Shone's Complex, which is also known as Shone's Syndrome - where the valves around the heart are too narrow and don't function properly. While her family have willingly taken part in research that has looked at how parents cope with long hospital stays - they found out it costs them around £1,000 a month - they haven't yet been asked to take part in any big medical trials to improve treatment and diagnosis. In the right circumstances Amelia's parents would be very keen to participate in studies that would help other families. ""I would do anything to help other people in the same situation and to raise that awareness,"" Kelly added. For young cardiac patients in the UK it is a very familiar story. New research, led by one of the consultants at Birmingham Children's Hospital, has recently laid bare the extent of the problem. The study, published in the European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, analysed all 333 clinical trials looking at surgery for congenital heart conditions published worldwide between January 2000 and August 2016. Only 10 trials were conducted in the UK and none of these were large, influential trials which are needed to change treatments or guidelines. Only 431 out of the estimated 65,000 children who underwent heart surgery in the UK in this time frame were enrolled in a clinical trial. This worked out to be 0.7%. Mr Nigel Drury, a consultant in paediatric cardiac surgery at Birmingham Children's Hospital where Amelia is being treated, said: ""The surgery available for children with heart problems has improved dramatically over the past 20 years. ""However, by not carrying out large-scale, cutting-edge clinical trials to continually improve surgeries, we're letting down the thousands of children born in the UK each year with heart problems."" The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation, their medical director Sir Nilesh Samani said: ""For many children with congenital heart disease, the only treatment available is surgery. ""It can be a difficult choice for parents to agree to their child participating in research. ""However, the only way we can improve the range and quality of treatments for these children is through clinical trials. ""This study shows that we can and should do better if we are to improve the treatment and outcomes of children with congenital heart disease."" In a statement the Department of Health told Sky News: ""We would like to see children who are born with a congenital heart defect benefit from improved treatments and the results of clinical trials. ""Each year we make £1bn available through the National Institute for Health Research into new treatments, and it welcomes funding applications on all health conditions."""

Mrs May thanked those in the armed forces and the emergency services who ""inspired the nation"" in their responses to the Grenfell Tower fire and terror attacks in Manchester and London this year. She thanked aid workers abroad and volunteers in the UK working over Christmas and asked people to remember those around the world who are denied religious freedom, especially the ""sickening persecution"" of the Rohingya Muslims.

2017-12-23,Ever seen a homeless person and wanted to help?

As I often did, I bought them some food, but when I gave it to her, the huge dog snapped at me. He had a muzzle on, so I kept all my fingers, but I asked the apologetic woman why he'd reacted like that.""This is Oscar. He is my protector,"" she said, ruffling the now-docile dog's fur. ""Every night, I get violence and abuse, but he keeps troublesome people away. Still, I don't remember the last time I wasn't afraid.""Back at home, I couldn't stop thinking about Jenny. :: 'Homelessness crisis is like fighting a losing battle' She's only 38 years old and she told me she'd been homeless for two years after running away from a violent partner. Wanting to do something for her, I set up a JustGiving page. My target was £200, just to give her a break, but overnight, my friends raised more than £700. I realised we had a chance to get Jenny off the street. Or so I thought. When I told Jenny what I had done, she could barely get her head around it. She was so used to life on the streets, she couldn't see how she could be so lucky that someone wanted to help her get herself back together. She broke down in tears and for days after, she kept ""waiting for a catch"". But there wasn't one - I just wanted to help. Jenny spoke to an outreach worker for a local charity who found her a privately rented flat that would take her and Oscar. I used the cash to pay a deposit and six-week's rent.Soon after that, Jenny reached out to an old employer and got a job in the hotel industry. But, over the following weeks, I got a sobering insight into how hard it is to get back on your feet. It would be five weeks before Jenny got paid. How was she going to make her rent every week in the meantime? :: Govt accused of 'unacceptable complacency' on homelessness in damning report ""I don't want to lose what I've got now,"" she told me, desperation in her voice.""I won't let that happen,"" I said, with a confidence I didn't feel. I work as a magazine journalist and just about cover my own expenses every month. I had no idea how I was going to cover hers too.Desperate for cash, I started selling anything I could on eBay. What was more important? A pair of Louboutin shoes (my one-and-only luxury possession) or a week's rent? I sold my Louboutins. I've relied so much on my friends sharing my JustGiving page and the response has been phenomenal. Overwhelmingly, people have dug deep and told me they have been inspired seeing someone's life change right in front of them. I've also been supported by work colleagues, who have given Jenny bags of toiletries and clothes vouchers, and held cake and book sales to raise money. But it's a struggle. We've spent everything we've raised so far on all the normal expenses like travel to work, gas, electricity, rent and food. Plus, we have had emergency expenses. Two years on the street, without access to medical or dental care, have really taken their toll and we had to find £200 when Jenny developed a really painful infected tooth abscess. To make things worse, Oscar was recently diagnosed with a malignant tumour, and we can't afford the vet fees to treat him. Right now, I'm £800 overdrawn from trying to keep Jenny afloat. It will take another few months until she can sort herself out. I'm scared she could lose everything she has worked so hard to build back up if we don't get more help. I do wonder why I started this whole thing. I'm in debt, stressed out, and have had to drastically cut down on Christmas presents. It also seems like such a small thing when the problem of homelessness is so tragically huge. I remember asking myself that first morning: ""What difference is helping one person going to make?"" But Jenny answered that for me yesterday. ""I have that feeling again, that I am part of the world, that I matter,"" she said. To her, the difference was everything and I'm going to carry on helping as long as I possibly can. As much as I have changed Jenny's life, this whole experience has changed mine, too. :: To donate to support Jenny's cause, visit https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/lisa-howells"

Humble qualities go a long way in the marketing of a sports person when you can back them up with spectacular performances and results. And he has. The manner of his April victory over Vladimir Klitschko, a king in the heavyweight division for over a decade, has put him right up there at the top of his sport. :: Joshua beats Klitschko: The fight in pictures Heavyweight fights of that magnitude and quality don't come along that often and when you manage to snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat the way Joshua did - well that's the stuff of legends. The sort of sporting event where you want to be able to say: ""I was there."" I was there that night at Wembley and have interviewed Joshua three times this year. What comes across is how much he wants to be remembered as more than just a fighter. He wants to be thought of along with the likes of Roger Federer or Rory McIroy - someone who transcends sport and someone who has elevated the sport of boxing. The trash talk that boxing often relies on to generate publicity and sales is not for him. ""I'm at a stage now where I'm at a level, before I was happy to be part of boxing, now I'm here to stamp my mark and my legacy,"" he says. ""I really get the level I'm at now and if I want to be thought of among the elite, I have to carry myself in a certain way."" But he did recently get involved in a terse Twitter spat with Tyson Fury - and that served as a reminder that he can't retaliate on social media if he wants to be a sporting great. He's still learning about such things because his story has unfolded so quickly. From the moment he walked into the gym in Finchley, north London, with his cousin in 2007 to winning Olympic gold to becoming world champion. He's barely had a moment to collect his thoughts, as he says ""There's never been a minute to reflect, it's always been what's next?"" And what is next? Joshua says he'll fight anyone who he, and his promoter Eddie Hearn, can make a deal with. In 2018 that could mean Joseph Parker the WBO champion, a possible blockbuster with Deontay Wilder the WBC champion, and all British showdown with Tyson Fury, if he can get back to fitness. :: Joshua goads 'Beyonce' Wilder over bout This is clearly the fight that the domestic public would love and he'd be happy to oblige. ""It is a fight I'd like to see but as I said the ball is in his court. He has to get fit. I stay consistent, I can't do much more than carry on doing what I'm doing,"" he says. AJ won't train on Christmas day but he will be back into the gym straight after and be ready for whoever. In 2017 Joshua became a sporting superstar. That star is still on the rise and 2018 could be even more exciting."
2017-12-23,The Prime Minister has rejected a petition from survivors and bereaved relatives of the Grenfell Tower fire to diversify the public inquiry into the disaster.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171224001929/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-rejects-petition-to-diversify-grenfell-fire-inquiry-panel-11181341,"Last week during two days of procedural hearings, lawyers for those most closely affected by the tragedy argued that an ethnically diverse panel of experts was needed to sit alongside the inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick. He has appeared to be sympathetic to the idea of having such experts for advice and consultation, but said that giving them decision-making powers was up to the Prime Minister who established the inquiry's terms of reference. On Friday, Theresa May said that additional panel members should not be appointed in order for the first stage of the inquiry to be completed ""as quickly as reasonably possible"". In a letter to Sir Martin, she said she felt the probe had ""the necessary expertise to undertake its work"". She continued: ""I am also very conscious of the need for the inquiry to complete its initial report as quickly as reasonably possible. I therefore consider that additional panel members should not be appointed at this stage."" The initial report was supposed to be delivered by next Easter, but the huge task of interviewing witnesses means that target has already slipped to autumn 2018. The decision risks alienating some of those who are due to give evidence about what happened. Emma Dent Coad, Labour MP for Kensington, said she will do all she can to ensure the panel is formed. She tweeted: ""This inquiry will suffer a crisis of confidence if those in power refuse to engage with the wishes of survivors and the bereaved. I'm calling on the Prime Minister to reverse this decision."" Joe Delaney of the Grenfell Action Group told Sky News: ""We are disappointed but sadly we are not surprised. Theresa May talks a good game but actions speak louder than words. ""She has let down the community."" Mr Delaney added that while he did think Sir Martin would be able to lead the inquiry well, he was dismayed by the difference in local people's remit to ""advise"" compared with the businesses involved in the cladding and their remit to ""inspect"". He added: ""Every single one of the solicitor's groups said that they would like this to happen, but once again we have been ignored. ""Shame on you Theresa May."""

It is run by volunteers from the charity Help Refugees which is raising money to support their work in Europe and the Middle East. The shop sells items in three sections representing the stages of a refugee's experience: Arrival, Shelter and The Future. Customers can purchase 'real' gifts that are then sent out to refugee camps on the front line of the migration crisis. The store is described as providing ""an uplifting yet meaningful retail experience a striking space where people can learn about refugees while doing something practical to help"". There has been interest in opening more shops in other parts of the country, and across the world, including most recently in New York. Josie Naughton, from Help Refugees, told Sky News that the concept was about ""connecting"" with people. She said: ""Two years ago the refugee crisis was on the front page of every newspaper. It was in the news but it's not really being talked about anymore. ""People don't necessarily realise that there are still people in need and that it's still going on. ""So we have had to be thinking of new and interesting ways to let people know."" Hassan Akkad, 29, fled Syria in 2015 and travelled thousands of miles to the UK by boat and on foot through Greece, Serbia, Hungary, Germany and France. He remembers the daily struggle of trying to survive with nothing. ""The simplest things in life, the things you find very simple, are really difficult to get when you are doing that journey,"" he said. ""For us it was a challenge to get fresh water initially. It was a challenge to find somewhere to buy a tent, or to get a sleeping bag. ""...it's just nice to see someone even with a cup of tea, a warm jumper, or a sleeping bag. It just makes you feel human again."" There are currently 65 million people who have been forced to flee their homes around the world, which is a ""significant increase"" on previous years according to the UN refugee agency. Lara Padoan from the UNHCR said: ""The reason that people are fleeing is because it's safer for them to be in another country. ""They're leaving their homes because of the bombing in Syria, the persecution in places like Eritrea, because of the war ongoing in South Sudan. ""We've seen a number of ongoing conflicts, protracted crises like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and of course Syria is one of the biggest conflicts forcing huge numbers of people across borders. ""But we've also seen new wars emerging that are also forcing people to flee. The situation in South Sudan, Burundi, Central African Republic. ""That's also sparking these new waves of displacement."""

According to the Mail on Sunday, the team of the Army's most senior officer, General Sir Nick Carter, the chief of general staff, wrote a document circulated among senior officers and drawing upon market research. It said: ""Market research in May 17 found that Be the Best did not resonate with many of our key audiences and was considered dated, elitist and non-inclusive. ""The ECAB [Executive Committee of the Army Board] therefore agreed that its use should be phased out as soon as affordably possible.

People in London are the most likely to be seen in a church come Christmas morning, with 14% going on Christmas Day and 34% going to church at some point over the festive period. Immigration of Christians from Eastern Europe and Africa has helped to stem the decline in church attendance in some areas, with London home a greater number of migrants than any other region - around three million foreign-born people living in the capital.

Mr Mackinlay's report is being backed by the Brexit-leaning European Research Group. It is claimed such an initiative would raise £150m a year, which could be invested in high-tech equipment at UK borders. It is also suggested the system would help provide quicker and more automated border checks to ""minimise travel delays for legitimate travellers"". Another claimed benefit would be a ""wealth of information"" to boost security and intelligence. Mr Mackinlay said visitors could be asked to provide an address for their time in the UK, helping authorities to track them down if they over-stayed their visas. He added that it would enable border officers to ""focus on the people who pose the greatest threat"", while cutting delays for others. The Government is expected to publish an immigration white paper in the New Year. Ministers have been sent the report. The US charges $14 for an ESTA visa waiver, allowing multiple entries over the next two years. Visitors have to hand over information prior to departure, with pre-approved entry making arrival checks quicker. ""The EU is investigating implementing its own version of charges on travellers; the USA already does, the UK should reciprocate and in doing so raise £150 million a year to invest in our borders,"" the European Research Group said in a foreword to the report. ""A new modern digital border funded by those that use it would save travellers time, help keep the UK open to genuine visitors while giving the UK the information it needs to exclude those that are not."""

But the Scottish Conservatives labelled the stunt ""utterly childish"". Mr Stevenson ordered the Cullen Skink pie's delivery to Whitehall in a bid to catch Mr Davis' attention about potential customs queues after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Stevenson, who represents Europe's biggest fishing port at Peterhead, said he hoped the minister would use Christmas to come up with a ""clear plan for exactly how he's going to protect Scotland's seafood sector"". He warned against ""Tory ineptitude"" and a no-deal divorce. ""Nor do we want to see lorry-loads of fresh, high-quality Scottish seafood waiting by the lorryload in queues at Dover for lengthy customs checks,"" Mr Stevenson said.

Going ahead with the U-turn risks infuriating Tories in rural parts of the country. The plans were described as ""pure speculation"" by a Downing Street source. They added: ""There is no vote that could change the current policy on fox hunting scheduled in this session of Parliament."" Since Michael Gove was appointed as environment secretary by Mrs May after the June election, he has placed animal welfare at the top of his priority list. During the election campaign Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised Mrs May for saying she was in favour of fox hunting, which crushed the prime minister's authority after the Conservatives lost their Commons majority. During a visit to a Leeds factory during the election, Mrs May said: ""As it happens, personally, I've always been in favour of fox hunting and we maintain our commitment - we had a commitment previously - as a Conservative Party to allow a free vote and that would allow Parliament to take a decision on this."" However there were early indications Mrs May would possibly not go through with the vote after the policy was not included in the Queen's Speech outlining legislation for the 2017-2019 parliamentary session. Fox hunting has been outlawed since 2004 when Tony Blair's Labour government introduced the Hunting Act banning the use of dogs to hunt foxes and wild mammals in England and Wales."

In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the North's foreign ministry said: ""We define this 'sanctions resolution' rigged up by the US and its followers as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of our Republic, as an act of war violating peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region and categorically reject the 'resolution'."" The new resolution is tantamount to a complete economic blockade of North Korea, the ministry added. The US-drafted resolution seeks to ban nearly 90%of refined petroleum exports to the North by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and demands the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months. It also caps crude oil supplies to the North at 4 million barrels a year and commits the UN Security Council to make further reductions if another nuclear test or ICBM launch was conducted. North Korea's foreign ministry said those who voted for the sanctions would face Pyongyang's wrath. ""Those countries that raised their hands in favour of this 'sanctions resolution' shall be held completely responsible for all the consequences to be caused by the 'resolution' and we will make sure for ever and ever that they pay heavy price for what they have done."" It said its nuclear weapons ""are a self-defensive deterrence not in contradiction of international law"". ""We will further consolidate our self-defensive nuclear deterrence aimed at fundamentally eradicating the US nuclear threats, blackmail and hostile moves by establishing the practical balance of force with the US,"" it added. North Korea has carried out 20 missile tests this year, adding to fears that the country will soon have an arsenal capable of targeting the US mainland. The latest, at the end of November, was its most powerful to date."

Also, earlier this month, one mum called for Manchester's Dick Whittington to be axed for being ""lewd and offensive"". Panto veteran Christopher Biggins - who is starring as Widow Twankey in Aladdin in Richmond - says the calls to tone down the traditional Christmas shows have gone too far. He said: ""The whole thing is ridiculous and is getting out of hand. In a way I'm pleased I'm nearing the end of my pantomime career. ""I'm 69, I'll be 70 next year, hopefully I'll do one more pantomime and then I'll retire from pantomime because it's a joke, you soon won't be able to do anything anywhere. ""Innuendo is fantastic and is wonderful and is joyous for the parents and the children,"" he added. Across the country kids buzzing with sugary sweets are watching their favourite panto and for the adults there's no shortage of double entendres. But in a year where sexual harassment in the entertainment industry has come into the spotlight, panto producers are wary. Michael Harrison, managing director of Qdos Pantomimes, told the Daily Telegraph he felt it would have been wrong to have someone looking up a skirt. He said: ""I have cut that. Last Christmas it was in nearly every panto in the land, including the Palladium, but this year it just feels wrong. ""What I have not done and what I won't do is change any jokes, as I don't believe there is a link between sexual harassment and pantomime. Nobody touches anybody in pantomime. And as far as somewhere like the Palladium goes, of course the show is full of innuendo because we are working with Julian Clary."" For those watching the Christmas Eve matinee performance at the Palladium, rude jokes weren't a concern. ""I find them very, very rude and I'm enjoying every single minute of it,"" said one woman. Another added: ""Really naughty! Fabulous! It's great… I don't think the youngsters will get half of the jokes to be honest, but it's great."" Editor of What's On Stage, Theo Bosanquet, says striking the right tone is a difficult balancing act for panto producers. He said: ""Pantomime is in essence a family entertainment, but of course it's one that comes with a lot of quite bawdy traditions so I think any producer has to weigh up whether the jokes they're including cross a line that might make some parents uncomfortable. ""I think it's always a tricky balancing act when it comes to pantomime, nobody wants to clean it up completely, but I think on occasion the jokes can go that little bit too far, push the envelope, and that unfortunately does make some parents particularly feel uncomfortable,"" he added."

A total of 44.7 million tons of old computers, domestic appliances and gadgets were thrown away in 2016. To try to visualise those figures, researchers calculated that it's equivalent to the weight of 4,500 Eiffel Towers, and if it was loaded into trucks it would need 1.23 million of them stretching from New York to Bangkok and back again. In Britain, everyone throws away an average of 25kg of equipment every year. The current recycling rate is around 45%, but the Government has increased that target to 65% by 2019. To be properly recycled, it needs to be taken to a council waste site, which then sends it to authorised WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) centres. Sweeep Kuusakoski in Sittingbourne in Kent is one of Britain's biggest WEEE centres, handling 36,000 tons every year, mostly smaller electrical items, rather than large white goods such as washing machines and fridges. The items are smashed to pieces and spun to separate and recover parts which can be reused. Commercial manager Justin Greenaway told Sky News: ""A PC is literally gold to us. There's probably about 70g of gold in every ton of computers. When we spin apart a computer we create metals and plastics and circuit boards. We melt the circuit boards to create gold from those."" But the challenge is to persuade people not to simply throw things away along with household rubbish. Mr Greenaway said: ""It's very tempting if something fits in a black bag it ends up in a black bag, and at that point it's rubbish, it's either going to waste-to-energy (incineration), or landfill and it's a sin considering the work and the commodities that have gone into creating the gadgets that we love."" Manufacturers are legally bound to help pay for the collection and disposal of their old products before new ones are allowed to take their place in shops. But by making and selling them cheaply they've created a throwaway culture, where it's simpler to replace than repair. The UN researchers estimated that if valuable parts were stripped from every discarded piece of equipment it would be worth $55bn (£41bn). And yet 80% of it is discarded into rubbish tips, or cluttering up people's homes because they can't be bothered to dispose of it properly."

""I lost my apartment to the bank a couple of years ago and then I was living in a house and the house was sold."" Both men identify as straight, and Mr Sullivan has children with a female ex-partner. Donal Moloney, who photographed the wedding, said Mr O'Sullivan had told a ""lovely story"" about his new husband which had moved all present to tears during the ceremony. ""He then finished by saying 'I love Matt' - everyone was very touched by that, obviously,"" Mr Moloney told Sky News. ""These guys are very genuine soulmates. Michael is constantly looking out for Matt."" Ireland legalised gay marriage, following a referendum on the issue, in 2015. ""The registry office can't refuse because they've granted us a licence to get married. We've done everything right,"" Mr O'Sullivan said."

Neither referred to Brexit or the tumultuous political year they have both faced. Mrs May thanked those in the armed forces and the emergency services who ""inspired the nation"" in their responses to the Grenfell Tower fire and terror attacks in Manchester and London this year. She thanked aid workers abroad and volunteers in the UK working over Christmas and asked people to remember those around the world who are denied religious freedom, especially the ""sickening persecution"" of the Rohingya Muslims. The Conservative leader, whose father was a vicar, said: ""As we gather with our friends and family, I want to say thank you to all those whose service to others means they will be spending time away from their loved ones this Christmas. :: Manchester bombing: The victims ""The heroes in our emergency services, whose courage and dedication so inspired the nation in response to tragedy at Grenfell Tower and the abhorrent terrorist attacks in Manchester and London. ""But whose service saves lives in our communities every day, including Christmas Day. ""As we celebrate the birth of Christ, let us celebrate all those selfless acts - and countless others - that epitomise the values we share: Christian values of love, service and compassion that are lived out every day in our country by people all faiths and none. ""Let us take pride in our Christian heritage and the confidence it gives us to ensure that in Britain you can practice your faith free from question or fear. ""So this Christmas, whatever our faith, let us come together confident and united in the values we share. And wherever you are at this special time of year, let me wish you all a very happy Christmas."" Mr Corbyn, who has previously refused to discuss whether he holds any religious beliefs, urged people to think about others who are ""cut off and lonely"" or living in war-torn nations at Christmas. He called on Britons to ""show them you care"" and said Britain was a ""compassionate nation"". :: Yemen: The civil war and humanitarian crisis explained The opposition leader urged people to think about those without a home, those who feel ""cut off and lonely"", especially older citizens, and carers. He added: ""And abroad we think of those living in nations like Yemen, Syria and Libya in fear of bombs and bullets, of injury and death. ""None of this is inevitable. We pride ourselves on being a compassionate nation. ""My Christmas wish is that we all do more to help bring about the kind of society and world we want to live in.

2017-12-24,"In Dr Strangelove, deterrence is defined as ""the art of producing in the mind of the enemy… the fear to attack"". Deterrence only works if the enemy knows about the deterrent. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171225004255/https://news.sky.com/story/what-would-a-cyberwar-between-the-uk-and-russia-look-like-11180856,"Things go south in that film because the USSR develops a superweapon, the Doomsday machine, in complete secrecy. As Dr Strangelove himself puts it: ""Of course, the whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh?"" The UK has been telling the world about its deterrent cyberweapon program since at least 2011, when it first acknowledged the program. Since then, we've seen numerous and devastating hacks from nation states including Russia, Iran and North Korea. One wonders how effective that UK deterrent has been. So the UK has decided to tell the world about its cyberweapons again. Boris Johnson has told the Russians that we will retaliate against cyberattacks. And in the Intelligence and Security Committee's annual review of the intelligence agencies, published this week, GCHQ said it was developing a ""full spectrum"" of offensive capabilities. GCHQ said that ranged from ""technical stuff... right through to what we would say is the high end of counter-state offensive cybercapabilities which might never be used, and everything in between."" What might those weapons look like in real life? The Times reports techniques including ""the ability to make another country's warplanes, ships and missiles malfunction and to infect a mobile phone to suck up information or wipe the memory"". In fact, we've seen examples of exactly that - from the Russians. Hacking into phones is on the low end of what nation-states are capable of. But in June, ships in the Black Sea were sent off course because their GPS signals were spoofed. Many systems - including missiles and drones - rely on GPS (although not entirely). Or take power stations. Ukraine's power grid has been shut down by cyberattacks twice in the last two years. Officials there have blamed Russia for the sabotage. For an example of what a Western cyberweapon might be capable of, you need to look, counter-intuitively, at North Korea. This week, the UK and USA officially blamed it for the Wannacry ransomware attack which spread rapidly around the world earlier this year. But its fearsome success was partly because it used tools developed by the US National Security Agency. Those tools were stolen, leaked publicly, then exploited by the North Koreans. The UK's cyber arsenal should at least match those capabilities, given GCHQ's expertise and funding levels."

He tweeted: ""There is no EU legislation dictating passport colour. The UK could have had any passport colour it wanted and stay in the EU."" :: Opinion: A passport is about national identity The Government announced its decision to change passport colours on Friday after the UK adopted the current burgundy hue when it joined the European Union. The new passports will be one of the most secure travel documents in the world with new features protecting against fraud and forgery, according to the Government. It said the current paper-based picture page will be replaced with a super-strength plastic polycarbonate material that will be more difficult to alter. Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis said: ""Leaving the EU gives us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path for ourselves in the world."" Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, a long-time campaigner for bringing back blue passports, called it a ""great Christmas present for those who care about our national identity"". He added: ""The fanatical Remainers hate it, but the restoration of our own British passport is a powerful symbol that Britain in Back!"" However, the announcement was criticised by others - including Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said it was ""insular, inward looking, nonsense"".

2017-12-24,The plight of Toys R Us UK is one that encapsulates many of the woes of traditional high street retailers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171225004255/https://news.sky.com/story/toys-r-us-not-alone-in-facing-string-of-challenges-in-retail-sector-11179623,"Online retailers have been able to sell toys more cheaply than it has been able to, thanks to not being burdened by overheads such as onerous property leases, business rates and Sunday trading laws, all of which hand online retailers a significant advantage. In the case of Toys R Us, it has also been hit by the loss in appeal of big out-of-town stores, in favour of smaller premises that can be used to showcase products that can then be bought on a ""click and collect"" basis. That is a problem that has not just afflicted Toys R Us but other rivals, notably Tesco, one of the pioneers in the field. As Steve Knights, the managing director of Toys R Us UK has admitted, the warehouse-style stores that it opened in the 1980s and 1990s, while successful in those days, ""are too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment"". Adding to the operation's woes has been the delay to the revaluation of business rates by the Government. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, announced in last month's Budget that, from next April, the rise in business rates will henceforth be indexed to the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rather than the higher Retail Prices Index. That reform is expected to save businesses £2.3bn during the next five years, while business rates will now be revalued every three years instead of every five years, making changes to rates less of a shock for retailers - like Toys R Us UK - that have large store estates. However, according to the property services company Colliers International, if this reform had been announced two years ago, it would have saved Toys R Us UK £17m. John Webber, the head of rating at Colliers International, told Property Week earlier this month: ""The stores in some parts of the country have been forced to pay for the better ones for far too long in terms of business rates. ""Taking the Exeter store as an example, the rates bill should have decreased by around 34%. But because of phasing, reductions have only been a small percentage this year and next. The business therefore will overpay in excess of £800,000 in business rates on that store alone. ""That's a lot of Barbies to sell."" Onto all of these woes can be overlaid the weak state of consumer confidence which, according to the latest figures published by research house GfK, has just slumped to its weakest level since December 2013. Confidence among British consumers has now been falling for almost two years and trading is said to have been weak across the high street since the rash of ""Black Friday"" promotions at the end of November. All this, according to the insolvency advisers Begbies Traynor, has put 43,677 retailers in ""significant financial distress"" - up by almost a quarter on December last year. The grocery wholesaler Palmer & Harvey has already gone under, with the loss of 3,000 jobs, while credit insurers - the crucial players that grease the wheels of the retail trade by protecting suppliers in the event of a retailer going bust before they get paid - are said to have reduced or, in some cases taken away entirely, cover for the electricals chain Maplins and the discount retailer Poundland. In the case of the latter, it is said to be trading well, but confidence among credit insurers has been rattled by problems in its South African parent Steinhoff, whose other UK assets include the furniture chains Bensons for Beds and Harveys. In the case of Toys R Us, there are also specific factors at play, not least the difficulties of its US parent company. It has debts totalling $5bn and filed for bankruptcy protection in September. Earlier this week, it reported that in the three months to October, it made a net loss of $623m after sales fell by nearly 5% - with like-for-like sales in the US down by 7%. The complex structure of Toys R Us, which has 17 subsidiaries including Toys R Us UK, may have contributed to the group's problems in Britain. There are said to be numerous inter-company loans in the business - which may help explain loans worth some £584.5m, that have apparently been written off, made by Toys R Us UK to a British Virgin Islands-based based entity. However, it is being suggested that rather than siphoning off money from the UK, other companies in the Toys R Us Group have been providing financial support to Toys R Us UK in the form of short term inter-company loans. On top of that, of course, is the pension fund - the issue that has brought to a head the crisis at Toys R Us UK. The pensions scheme at the business has a deficit of £30m. But, in order for the scheme to be tipped into the Pension Protection Fund lifeboat, the PPF is requiring Toys R Us UK to make a £9m contribution to the deficit. Toys R Us UK claims not to have the money while the wider Toys R Us Group claims it is unable to provide it due to its bankruptcy protection process. The pensions situation is also likely to be an issue hurting other UK retailers. A decade of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing has depressed the yield on UK government gilts - a key measure by which future pension liabilities are calculated. Pension deficits everywhere have been growing, obliging companies everywhere to pay more into their schemes, something that in particular has hit retailers employing large numbers of people. Toys R Us is extremely unlikely to be the last British retailer to experience turmoil this winter."

An initial post-mortem on the aardvark suggests she most likely died from smoke inhalation while sleeping. Dominic Jermey, director general of the Zoological Society of London, told Sky News that staff were ""devastated"" by the loss of Misha, describing her as a ""very popular animal with us"". Apart from the meerkats, all other animals are ""safe and secure"", the zoo has said. The fire began at about 6am on Saturday in the tourist attraction's Animal Adventure section. As well as tearing through the shop and cafe, it also damaged half an adjacent petting zoo. Some staff who live on site and who moved animals to safety were later treated for smoke inhalation. More than 70 firefighters attended the scene, and managed to get the blaze under control by about 9.15am. An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way. London Fire Brigade station manager David George said specialist fire investigation teams would search through the debris to try to find the cause of the blaze.

President Rodrigo Duterte, who is from the city, visited victims' relatives outside the burning building on Saturday night. He told them there was ""zero"" chance their family members had survived, witnesses said. The fire came after about 200 people were killed by a tropical storm which displaced tens of thousands of people, mainly in the south, over the past few days. Flames were eventually brought under control early on Sunday morning but fire officials said they had not yet entered the section where they believed the missing were trapped. The top floor was home to a 24-hour call centre for US multinational market research company SSI. Retired seaman Jimmy Quimsing was waiting to hear about his 25-year-old son Jim Benedict who worked at the call centre and had not been in contact since the fire broke out. He said he spoke to President Duterte who told him to prepare for the worst. ""He told us zero, no one would survive under these circumstances,"" Mr Quimsing said. Honeyfritz Alagano, Davao's fire marshal, said the blaze may have started on the third floor in a furniture department. He said: ""One of our firemen here has a kid who is an (call centre) agent in there. He told us some of them went to collect their stuff at their lockers and were trapped. ""The mall is an enclosed space with no ventilation. When our firemen tried to enter they were pushed back by smoke and fire."" There are few to no fire safety standards in the Philippines and massive fires are not uncommon. In 2015 72 people were killed in a slipper factory fire in Manila. Survivors blamed barred windows and sweatshop conditions for trapping workers inside."
2017-12-24,New guidelines on the use of anti-social behaviour powers have been drawn up to stop them being used on dog walkers and rough sleepers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171225004255/https://news.sky.com/story/anti-social-powers-revised-after-dog-walkers-and-buskers-targeted-11183638,"Campaigners argued the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 was being used as a ""busybody"" power because lawful and reasonable behaviour was being restricted in some cases. Earlier this year it was revealed dozens of councils had imposed the measures, with hundreds of fines issued for playing music too loudly in cars and not having a dog on a lead. The homeless, buskers, dog walkers and people gathering in small groups in town centres were incorrectly being targeted, charities and other groups found. The revised guidelines state: ""Given that these orders can restrict what people can do and how they behave in public spaces, it is important that the restrictions imposed are focused on specific behaviours and are proportionate to the detrimental effect that the behaviour is causing or can cause, and are necessary to prevent it from continuing, occurring or recurring."" :: Civil Rights Group Challenges Ban On Swearing :: Police effectiveness: What rating does your force get in HMIC report? The Home Office is issuing the best practice guide to councils and police to ensure the powers are applied appropriately. Officers have to make a judgement as to whether the behaviour is unreasonable, the guidance says. ""For instance, a baby crying in the middle of the night may well have a detrimental effect on immediate neighbours and is likely to be persistent in nature,"" it says. ""However, it is unlikely to be reasonable to issue the parents with a Community Protection Notice if there is not a great deal that they can do to control or affect the behaviour."" Victoria Atkins, Minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability, said: ""Anti-social behaviour harms communities and can severely impact people's way of life, which is why this Government introduced powers to make it quicker and easier to take action against the perpetrators of anti-social behaviour. ""The powers should be used proportionately to tackle anti-social behaviour, and not to target specific groups or the most vulnerable in our communities. ""The revised guidance published today will empower local agencies by providing even greater clarity on where and when these powers should be applied, helping them to keep our public spaces, communities and families safe."""

Ms Maltby has accused Mr Green of touching her knee at a pub in 2015, and also claims he once sent her a suggestive text message after she was photographed wearing a corset. The text conversation reported on Sunday suggests she remained in contact with him after she claimed she alerted a Downing Street aide to his behaviour. Mr Green has been accused of leaking the messages. It is also alleged that the texts were edited to undermine Ms Maltby. He has denied the allegations. Conservative minister Anna Soubry attacked Mr Green, saying: ""Any attempt to smear or trash [Ms Maltby] was wrong and shameful."" Ms Maltby said on Twitter on Sunday morning that she was considering legal action, after being ""forced to consider all recourse"". Mr Green told Sky News: ""I have not leaked any material."" Ms Maltby, in an article written for The Sunday Times, made further allegations against Mr Green. In the piece, she wrote: ""In the days before I made my allegation public, I became aware of two young women who were considering mak­ing allegations against him (Mr Green). Their positions were more vulnerable, their allegations more serious."" In response to this allegation, Mr Green said: ""I have no idea what this refers to, and no such allegations were put to me."" Ms Maltby posted several tweets on Sunday morning in which she claimed the Mail on Sunday had misrepresented her text messages. Friends of Ms Maltby have told Sky News: ""Kate is grateful that the Prime Minister took a strong line on Damian Green and she accepts that Theresa May is serious about combating sexual harassment in Westminster, but the Prime Minister needs to work harder to ensure her MPs do not smear accusers who come forward."" Ms Maltby accused Mr Green of touching her leg while they had a drink in Waterloo in an article in The Times. ""I felt a fleeting hand against my knee - so brief, it was almost deniable,"" she wrote. Mr Green resigned on Wednesday after a report cleared him of watching or downloading pornography, but found he made two ""misleading"" and ""inaccurate"" statements about knowledge of the claims. The Cabinet Office inquiry found Ms Maltby's claims to be ""plausible"", but said it was ""not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of Mr Green's behaviour"". Mr Green said he ""deeply regretted"" the ""distress"" caused to Ms Maltby and acknowledged that he ""clearly made her feel uncomfortable - and for this I apologise""."

Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters in late November that the captain said water had entered through the diesel-electric vessel's snorkel when its batteries were being changed. Officials also said an unusual sound was detected in the ocean near the submarine's last known position - three hours after it made its final contact. They said the noise was ""consistent with an explosion"". Previous detected contacts so far have been false alarms, with one coming from a sunken fishing boat. The San Juan's disappearance led to the head of Argentina's navy, Admiral Marcelo Srur, being dismissed earlier this month. In his first public comments on the missing sub, President of Argentina Mauricio Macri said: ""The disappearance and current search for the ARA San Juan submarine has touched all Argentines.

2017-12-25,"Panto veteran Christopher Biggins has told Sky News calls to tone down panto innuendo are ""ridiculous"" after a sketch in Dick Whittington was cut from the London Palladium production. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171226010528/https://news.sky.com/story/biggins-slams-attempts-to-tone-down-panto-amid-weinstein-scandal-11184128,"Qdos Pantomimes has removed part of its Palladium production involving a male character looking up a female performer's skirt following the sexual abuse allegations surrounding Harvey Weinstein. Also, earlier this month, one mum called for Manchester's Dick Whittington to be axed for being ""lewd and offensive"". Panto veteran Christopher Biggins - who is starring as Widow Twankey in Aladdin in Richmond - says the calls to tone down the traditional Christmas shows have gone too far. He said: ""The whole thing is ridiculous and is getting out of hand. In a way I'm pleased I'm nearing the end of my pantomime career. ""I'm 69, I'll be 70 next year, hopefully I'll do one more pantomime and then I'll retire from pantomime because it's a joke, you soon won't be able to do anything anywhere. ""Innuendo is fantastic and is wonderful and is joyous for the parents and the children,"" he added. Across the country kids buzzing with sugary sweets are watching their favourite panto and for the adults there's no shortage of double entendres. But in a year where sexual harassment in the entertainment industry has come into the spotlight, panto producers are wary. Michael Harrison, managing director of Qdos Pantomimes, told the Daily Telegraph he felt it would have been wrong to have someone looking up a skirt. He said: ""I have cut that. Last Christmas it was in nearly every panto in the land, including the Palladium, but this year it just feels wrong. ""What I have not done and what I won't do is change any jokes, as I don't believe there is a link between sexual harassment and pantomime. Nobody touches anybody in pantomime. And as far as somewhere like the Palladium goes, of course the show is full of innuendo because we are working with Julian Clary."" For those watching the Christmas Eve matinee performance at the Palladium, rude jokes weren't a concern. ""I find them very, very rude and I'm enjoying every single minute of it,"" said one woman. Another added: ""Really naughty! Fabulous! It's great… I don't think the youngsters will get half of the jokes to be honest, but it's great."" Editor of What's On Stage, Theo Bosanquet, says striking the right tone is a difficult balancing act for panto producers. He said: ""Pantomime is in essence a family entertainment, but of course it's one that comes with a lot of quite bawdy traditions so I think any producer has to weigh up whether the jokes they're including cross a line that might make some parents uncomfortable. ""I think it's always a tricky balancing act when it comes to pantomime, nobody wants to clean it up completely, but I think on occasion the jokes can go that little bit too far, push the envelope, and that unfortunately does make some parents particularly feel uncomfortable,"" he added."
2017-12-25,"In Dr Strangelove, deterrence is defined as ""the art of producing in the mind of the enemy… the fear to attack"". Deterrence only works if the enemy knows about the deterrent. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171226010528/https://news.sky.com/story/what-would-a-cyberwar-between-the-uk-and-russia-look-like-11180856,"Things go south in that film because the USSR develops a superweapon, the Doomsday machine, in complete secrecy. As Dr Strangelove himself puts it: ""Of course, the whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh?"" The UK has been telling the world about its deterrent cyberweapon program since at least 2011, when it first acknowledged the program. Since then, we've seen numerous and devastating hacks from nation states including Russia, Iran and North Korea. One wonders how effective that UK deterrent has been. So the UK has decided to tell the world about its cyberweapons again. Boris Johnson has told the Russians that we will retaliate against cyberattacks. And in the Intelligence and Security Committee's annual review of the intelligence agencies, published this week, GCHQ said it was developing a ""full spectrum"" of offensive capabilities. GCHQ said that ranged from ""technical stuff... right through to what we would say is the high end of counter-state offensive cybercapabilities which might never be used, and everything in between."" What might those weapons look like in real life? The Times reports techniques including ""the ability to make another country's warplanes, ships and missiles malfunction and to infect a mobile phone to suck up information or wipe the memory"". In fact, we've seen examples of exactly that - from the Russians. Hacking into phones is on the low end of what nation-states are capable of. But in June, ships in the Black Sea were sent off course because their GPS signals were spoofed. Many systems - including missiles and drones - rely on GPS (although not entirely). Or take power stations. Ukraine's power grid has been shut down by cyberattacks twice in the last two years. Officials there have blamed Russia for the sabotage. For an example of what a Western cyberweapon might be capable of, you need to look, counter-intuitively, at North Korea. This week, the UK and USA officially blamed it for the Wannacry ransomware attack which spread rapidly around the world earlier this year. But its fearsome success was partly because it used tools developed by the US National Security Agency. Those tools were stolen, leaked publicly, then exploited by the North Koreans. The UK's cyber arsenal should at least match those capabilities, given GCHQ's expertise and funding levels."
2017-12-25,"The Queen will use her Christmas Day broadcast to remember those affected by the traumatic events of 2017, with the importance of ""home"" being the central theme for her festive message.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171226010528/https://news.sky.com/story/home-at-heart-of-queens-christmas-broadcast-11184231,"Looking back on the past 12 months, the Queen will say: ""We think of our homes as places of warmth, familiarity and love... there is a timeless simplicity to the pull of home."" She will observe how the concept of home can extend to a home town or city, saying: ""This Christmas, I think of London and Manchester, whose powerful identities shone through over the past 12 months in the face of appalling attacks."" Throughout the year the Queen and other members of the Royal Family have visited those affected by the Manchester arena attack, the terrorist attacks in London and the Grenfell Tower fire disaster, as well as the emergency services who helped in the aftermath. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh also marked their 70th wedding anniversary, becoming the first ever couple in the British Royal Family to celebrate their platinum anniversary. And Prince Philip stepped back from his own programme of official public duties in May. In her message the Queen will pay tribute to her husband, praising his ""support and unique sense of humour"". Every year her pre-recorded message is broadcast at 3pm on Christmas Day and shown in all Commonwealth countries. It is written by the Queen drawing on her own experiences over the past year, often with a strong religious message reflecting her faith. It is one of the rare occasions when she does not turn to the Government for advice on what to include in the message, but is able to voice her own views. Two pictures taken during the filming of the broadcast show the Queen sitting beside a desk in the 1844 Room at Buckingham Palace wearing an ivory and white dress that she first wore during the Diamond Jubilee Thames River Pageant. Alongside her are four photographs. One shows Princess Elizabeth and her husband on their wedding day in 1947, another is one of the photos released to mark their wedding anniversary this November, and the two other photographs show their great grandchildren, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. The Queen traditionally spends Christmas at Sandringham with her family. On Thursday she was seen arriving at Kings Lynn train station with Prince Philip. On Christmas Day morning the Royal Family walked to St Mary Magdalene Church on the Sandringham estate for the church service. Large crowds gathered outside to see Prince Harry's fiancée, Meghan, joining the traditional festivities."
2017-12-25,A British woman was reportedly visibly upset as she stood accused of smuggling drugs in an Egyptian court on Christmas Day.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171226010528/https://news.sky.com/story/briton-accused-of-smuggling-drugs-into-egypt-in-tears-at-christmas-day-hearing-11184374,"Laura Plummer, from Hull, reportedly entered an incorrect plea and admitted importing the drugs by mistake after questions and responses in court were ""lost in translation"". The 33-year-old shop worker became so upset that the judge was forced to adjourn the hearing, her sister Rachel has said. It is thought the trial will commence once the defence has found a new interpreter. The court hearing comes after the tourist was arrested when she was found carrying 320 tramadol tablets in her suitcase. The painkillers are legal in the UK but banned in Egypt. The woman's family maintains she was taking the tablets for her Egyptian partner Omar Caboo, who suffers from severe back pain, and described her as ""naive"". They said she did not try to hide the medication and initially thought it was a joke when she was pulled up by officials. Rachel said: ""She's sleep deprived, she's visibly nervous and upset. ""She's answered some questions wrong because she's not understanding them. She obviously can't think straight. :: Hull woman held in Egypt for taking painkillers into country ""You can imagine the pressure - this is her life."" She said their mother Roberta Sinclair, who travelled to the country for the hearing, and Mr Caboo were denied access to the hearing as their driver was running late. Ms Plummer's lawyer Mohamed Othman said the allegations against his client were ""illogical"" as her plane ticket was ""double the price"" of the pills. He told Sky News: ""For someone to be found guilty of drugs smuggling they have to be aware that they are possessing narcotics. Laura did not know that what she was carrying was a narcotic."" Karl Turner, the MP for Hull East, told Sky News the hearing was adjourned to find Ms Plummer another interpreter. He said: ""Apparently something was lost in translation, the defence lawyer wasn't confident that Laura was understanding the questions first of all, and the interpreter wasn't correctly translating what Laura was saying in her answers."" Mr Turner also praised Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's efforts in dealing with the case after Foreign Minister Alastair Burt flew to Egypt to speak to his counterparts. He added: ""The evidence is pretty clear that she didn't know the drug was banned and she was taking it out there to help her boyfriend, who has come up with the evidence that he does suffer from a severe back problem."" Mrs Sinclair said her ""unrecognisable"" daughter was being held in a communal cell with up to 25 women and no beds. Ms Plummer is being held at the Red Sea resort of Hurghada after being arrested at the airport on 9 October. Her family has been told she could face up to 25 years in prison or even the death penalty, according to one lawyer."
2017-12-25,Britons are expected to embark on a £4.3bn spending spree as the Boxing Day sales kick in - up sharply from last year as squeezed consumers search for a bargain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171226010528/https://news.sky.com/story/britons-set-for-43bn-boxing-day-sales-splurge-11184460,"The total spend is predicted to rise by 12% from 2016, according to VoucherCodes and the Centre for Retail Research. Barclaycard, meanwhile, says one in three Britons (34%) will go to the festive sales - up from 23% last year. A poll for the company found that months of ""feeling the squeeze"" this year is resulting in many consumers looking forward to the sales to ease their budgets. It would represent somewhat of a recovery for the tradition post-Christmas price drop, which was affected last year by an extended period of sales for Black Friday. Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard, said: ""Last year, Black Friday overshadowed Boxing Day sales as many retailers struggled to maintain consumer interest in what has become a month-long discounting event. ""This year, however, value-seeking consumers appear to be more eager to buy cut-price items across both sales periods as they try to combat rising prices."""
2017-12-25,The plight of Toys R Us UK is one that encapsulates many of the woes of traditional high street retailers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171226010528/https://news.sky.com/story/toys-r-us-not-alone-in-facing-string-of-challenges-in-retail-sector-11179623,"Online retailers have been able to sell toys more cheaply than it has been able to, thanks to not being burdened by overheads such as onerous property leases, business rates and Sunday trading laws, all of which hand online retailers a significant advantage. In the case of Toys R Us, it has also been hit by the loss in appeal of big out-of-town stores, in favour of smaller premises that can be used to showcase products that can then be bought on a ""click and collect"" basis. That is a problem that has not just afflicted Toys R Us but other rivals, notably Tesco, one of the pioneers in the field. As Steve Knights, the managing director of Toys R Us UK has admitted, the warehouse-style stores that it opened in the 1980s and 1990s, while successful in those days, ""are too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment"". Adding to the operation's woes has been the delay to the revaluation of business rates by the Government. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, announced in last month's Budget that, from next April, the rise in business rates will henceforth be indexed to the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rather than the higher Retail Prices Index. That reform is expected to save businesses £2.3bn during the next five years, while business rates will now be revalued every three years instead of every five years, making changes to rates less of a shock for retailers - like Toys R Us UK - that have large store estates. However, according to the property services company Colliers International, if this reform had been announced two years ago, it would have saved Toys R Us UK £17m. John Webber, the head of rating at Colliers International, told Property Week earlier this month: ""The stores in some parts of the country have been forced to pay for the better ones for far too long in terms of business rates. ""Taking the Exeter store as an example, the rates bill should have decreased by around 34%. But because of phasing, reductions have only been a small percentage this year and next. The business therefore will overpay in excess of £800,000 in business rates on that store alone. ""That's a lot of Barbies to sell."" Onto all of these woes can be overlaid the weak state of consumer confidence which, according to the latest figures published by research house GfK, has just slumped to its weakest level since December 2013. Confidence among British consumers has now been falling for almost two years and trading is said to have been weak across the high street since the rash of ""Black Friday"" promotions at the end of November. All this, according to the insolvency advisers Begbies Traynor, has put 43,677 retailers in ""significant financial distress"" - up by almost a quarter on December last year. The grocery wholesaler Palmer & Harvey has already gone under, with the loss of 3,000 jobs, while credit insurers - the crucial players that grease the wheels of the retail trade by protecting suppliers in the event of a retailer going bust before they get paid - are said to have reduced or, in some cases taken away entirely, cover for the electricals chain Maplins and the discount retailer Poundland. In the case of the latter, it is said to be trading well, but confidence among credit insurers has been rattled by problems in its South African parent Steinhoff, whose other UK assets include the furniture chains Bensons for Beds and Harveys. In the case of Toys R Us, there are also specific factors at play, not least the difficulties of its US parent company. It has debts totalling $5bn and filed for bankruptcy protection in September. Earlier this week, it reported that in the three months to October, it made a net loss of $623m after sales fell by nearly 5% - with like-for-like sales in the US down by 7%. The complex structure of Toys R Us, which has 17 subsidiaries including Toys R Us UK, may have contributed to the group's problems in Britain. There are said to be numerous inter-company loans in the business - which may help explain loans worth some £584.5m, that have apparently been written off, made by Toys R Us UK to a British Virgin Islands-based based entity. However, it is being suggested that rather than siphoning off money from the UK, other companies in the Toys R Us Group have been providing financial support to Toys R Us UK in the form of short term inter-company loans. On top of that, of course, is the pension fund - the issue that has brought to a head the crisis at Toys R Us UK. The pensions scheme at the business has a deficit of £30m. But, in order for the scheme to be tipped into the Pension Protection Fund lifeboat, the PPF is requiring Toys R Us UK to make a £9m contribution to the deficit. Toys R Us UK claims not to have the money while the wider Toys R Us Group claims it is unable to provide it due to its bankruptcy protection process. The pensions situation is also likely to be an issue hurting other UK retailers. A decade of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing has depressed the yield on UK government gilts - a key measure by which future pension liabilities are calculated. Pension deficits everywhere have been growing, obliging companies everywhere to pay more into their schemes, something that in particular has hit retailers employing large numbers of people. Toys R Us is extremely unlikely to be the last British retailer to experience turmoil this winter."

In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the North's foreign ministry said: ""We define this 'sanctions resolution' rigged up by the US and its followers as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of our Republic, as an act of war violating peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region and categorically reject the 'resolution'."" The new resolution is tantamount to a complete economic blockade of North Korea, the ministry added. The US-drafted resolution seeks to ban nearly 90%of refined petroleum exports to the North by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and demands the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months. It also caps crude oil supplies to the North at 4 million barrels a year and commits the UN Security Council to make further reductions if another nuclear test or ICBM launch was conducted. North Korea's foreign ministry said those who voted for the sanctions would face Pyongyang's wrath. ""Those countries that raised their hands in favour of this 'sanctions resolution' shall be held completely responsible for all the consequences to be caused by the 'resolution' and we will make sure for ever and ever that they pay heavy price for what they have done."" It said its nuclear weapons ""are a self-defensive deterrence not in contradiction of international law"". ""We will further consolidate our self-defensive nuclear deterrence aimed at fundamentally eradicating the US nuclear threats, blackmail and hostile moves by establishing the practical balance of force with the US,"" it added. North Korea has carried out 20 missile tests this year, adding to fears that the country will soon have an arsenal capable of targeting the US mainland. The latest, at the end of November, was its most powerful to date."

Ms Maltby has accused Mr Green of touching her knee at a pub in 2015, and also claims he once sent her a suggestive text message after she was photographed wearing a corset. The text conversation reported on Sunday suggests she remained in contact with him after she claimed she alerted a Downing Street aide to his behaviour. Mr Green has been accused of leaking the messages. It is also alleged that the texts were edited to undermine Ms Maltby. He has denied the allegations. Conservative minister Anna Soubry attacked Mr Green, saying: ""Any attempt to smear or trash [Ms Maltby] was wrong and shameful."" Ms Maltby said on Twitter on Sunday morning that she was considering legal action, after being ""forced to consider all recourse"". Mr Green told Sky News: ""I have not leaked any material."" Ms Maltby, in an article written for The Sunday Times, made further allegations against Mr Green. In the piece, she wrote: ""In the days before I made my allegation public, I became aware of two young women who were considering mak­ing allegations against him (Mr Green). Their positions were more vulnerable, their allegations more serious."" In response to this allegation, Mr Green said: ""I have no idea what this refers to, and no such allegations were put to me."" Ms Maltby posted several tweets on Sunday morning in which she claimed the Mail on Sunday had misrepresented her text messages. Friends of Ms Maltby have told Sky News: ""Kate is grateful that the Prime Minister took a strong line on Damian Green and she accepts that Theresa May is serious about combating sexual harassment in Westminster, but the Prime Minister needs to work harder to ensure her MPs do not smear accusers who come forward."" Ms Maltby accused Mr Green of touching her leg while they had a drink in Waterloo in an article in The Times. ""I felt a fleeting hand against my knee - so brief, it was almost deniable,"" she wrote. Mr Green resigned on Wednesday after a report cleared him of watching or downloading pornography, but found he made two ""misleading"" and ""inaccurate"" statements about knowledge of the claims.

Police say they are waiting for toxicology results for more information on how the man died. Ms Campbell's family have said they are heartbroken by her death. Her mother Jayne said: ""Niki was not just my daughter but my best friend. Niki was the life and soul of the party. Always smiling and willing to help anyone."" ""Niki was part of a close knit family and was a brilliant auntie. Niki was bubbly and a happy go lucky person. Her death has left us utterly heartbroken and feeling empty.""

Detective Chief Inspector Terry Crompton said: ""My thoughts are very much with the families and we are continuing to support them through this incredibly hard time.""

Mr Mackinlay's report is being backed by the Brexit-leaning European Research Group. It is claimed such an initiative would raise £150m a year, which could be invested in high-tech equipment at UK borders. It is also suggested the system would help provide quicker and more automated border checks to ""minimise travel delays for legitimate travellers"". Another claimed benefit would be a ""wealth of information"" to boost security and intelligence. Mr Mackinlay said visitors could be asked to provide an address for their time in the UK, helping authorities to track them down if they over-stayed their visas. He added that it would enable border officers to ""focus on the people who pose the greatest threat"", while cutting delays for others. The Government is expected to publish an immigration white paper in the New Year. Ministers have been sent the report. The US charges $14 for an ESTA visa waiver, allowing multiple entries over the next two years. Visitors have to hand over information prior to departure, with pre-approved entry making arrival checks quicker. ""The EU is investigating implementing its own version of charges on travellers; the USA already does, the UK should reciprocate and in doing so raise £150 million a year to invest in our borders,"" the European Research Group said in a foreword to the report. ""A new modern digital border funded by those that use it would save travellers time, help keep the UK open to genuine visitors while giving the UK the information it needs to exclude those that are not."""

An initial post-mortem on the aardvark suggests she most likely died from smoke inhalation while sleeping. Dominic Jermey, director general of the Zoological Society of London, told Sky News that staff were ""devastated"" by the loss of Misha, describing her as a ""very popular animal with us"". Apart from the meerkats, all other animals are ""safe and secure"", the zoo has said. The fire began at about 6am on Saturday in the tourist attraction's Animal Adventure section. As well as tearing through the shop and cafe, it also damaged half an adjacent petting zoo. Some staff who live on site and who moved animals to safety were later treated for smoke inhalation. More than 70 firefighters attended the scene, and managed to get the blaze under control by about 9.15am. An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way. London Fire Brigade station manager David George said specialist fire investigation teams would search through the debris to try to find the cause of the blaze. The zoo was forced to close on Saturday. Families that had tickets for the zoo's Meet Santa event will be offered a refund, it said."

Guatemala was one of nine nations that voted with the United States when the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a non-binding resolution denouncing Mr Trump's policy earlier this week. The Central American country's President, Jimmy Morales, wrote on Facebook on Christmas Eve that after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he decided to instruct his foreign ministry to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This despite the UN declaring the US action as ""null and void"" by a margin of 128-9. Thirty-five nations abstained and 21 stayed away from the vote. No other country has its embassy in Jerusalem, though the Czech Republic is considering such a move. Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim the city's eastern sector. This was captured by Israel in 1967 and is home to sensitive religious sites. Mr Trump's announcement, which upended decades of US policy, has set off weeks of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces that have left 12 Palestinians dead. Meanwhile, Mr Netanyahu posted his Christmas message on Twitter with the caption: ""Merry Christmas from Jerusalem, the capital of Israel!"""

As Dr Strangelove himself puts it: ""Of course, the whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh?"" The UK has been telling the world about its deterrent cyberweapon program since at least 2011, when it first acknowledged the program. Since then, we've seen numerous and devastating hacks from nation states including Russia, Iran and North Korea. One wonders how effective that UK deterrent has been. So the UK has decided to tell the world about its cyberweapons again. Boris Johnson has told the Russians that we will retaliate against cyberattacks. And in the Intelligence and Security Committee's annual review of the intelligence agencies, published this week, GCHQ said it was developing a ""full spectrum"" of offensive capabilities. GCHQ said that ranged from ""technical stuff... right through to what we would say is the high end of counter-state offensive cybercapabilities which might never be used, and everything in between."" What might those weapons look like in real life? The Times reports techniques including ""the ability to make another country's warplanes, ships and missiles malfunction and to infect a mobile phone to suck up information or wipe the memory"". In fact, we've seen examples of exactly that - from the Russians. Hacking into phones is on the low end of what nation-states are capable of. But in June, ships in the Black Sea were sent off course because their GPS signals were spoofed. Many systems - including missiles and drones - rely on GPS (although not entirely). Or take power stations. Ukraine's power grid has been shut down by cyberattacks twice in the last two years. Officials there have blamed Russia for the sabotage. For an example of what a Western cyberweapon might be capable of, you need to look, counter-intuitively, at North Korea. This week, the UK and USA officially blamed it for the Wannacry ransomware attack which spread rapidly around the world earlier this year. But its fearsome success was partly because it used tools developed by the US National Security Agency. Those tools were stolen, leaked publicly, then exploited by the North Koreans. The UK's cyber arsenal should at least match those capabilities, given GCHQ's expertise and funding levels."

However bargain-hunters were still out in force in some places, with queues forming outside Selfridges in central London from 2.30am while intu, the owner of some of Britain's biggest shopping centres, reported a big rise in footfall. The wider drop in shopping trips to physical stores comes as consumers increasingly turn online for their purchases. November's Black Friday event has also been blamed for bringing forward store discounting from the traditional Boxing Day period. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""We did anticipate a drop in footfall on Boxing Day this year, but the scale of the drop is greater than expected. ""Given that last year footfall declined by 1.4% up to 5pm, but dropped by 2.3% over the 24 hour period as a whole, we are now expecting footfall to decline by more than 4% compared with last year over the day as a whole. ""The drop in footfall - the fifth out of the past six years - reinforces the lessening of the importance of Boxing Day as a key trading day in the retail calendar"". The Springboard figures showed a 5.8% decline for high street shopping visits, a 4% downturn for shopping centres and a 2% drop at out of town locations. Online sales fared better and some shoppers were already spending on Christmas Day itself, with sales on 25 December up 5% on last year according to ecommerce trends experts PCA Predict. They were forecast to be up 6.2% for Boxing Day. Currys PC World said more than a quarter of a million customers logged on in one hour on Tuesday morning, with 63% using phones to place orders. Selfridges said that after three hours trading on Boxing Day from 9am it had registered £4m in sales at its London, Birmingham and Manchester stores and online and it was expecting a record-breaking day. Barclaycard has predicted that 34% of Britons will go to the festive sales, up from 23% last year. It found that after months of ""feeling the squeeze"" amid rising inflation and weak pay growth, many consumers were looking forward to taking advantage of discounts. Intu, owner of shopping centres including Gateshead's Metrocentre, Manchester's Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, reported an 8.5% rise in footfall by mid-afternoon.

The 33-year-old from Hull was arrested as she arrived in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in October, but was jailed on Boxing Day. Laura's sister Jayne Synclair told Sky News: ""We've had an awful Christmas. ""We're also devastated by the news that it's been able to carry on this far and the fact that she's been sentenced for three years, just for being kind, it's a disgrace."" The court case was originally due to be heard on Christmas Day but had to be adjourned because of Ms Plummer's condition. Her family said she was ""sleep deprived"", ""visibly nervous"" and ""upset"" to the extent that the presiding official had to call a halt to proceedings. She misunderstood one of the members of the bench and at one point accidentally confessed, her MP told Sky News. Since October, her family says she has been held in a communal cell with no beds and up to 25 other women. Ms Synclair said: ""She's absolutely terrified, she's petrified... she looks shocking, she looks shock white, her hair has fallen out, her teeth are all discoloured, she's got a rash all over her face, she couldn't even stand up in court. ""She's probably on the verge of a mental breakdown. ""After she was sentenced to three years, she was then put in a cage, like an animal. ""My mum's in pieces, Laura is in pieces. Just an absolute nightmare."" Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, is banned in Egypt but is legal in the UK. However, as a class C drug, it is only available when prescribed by a doctor or other healthcare professional and it is illegal for anyone else to supply it. The family said a friend gave Ms Plummer the medicine, which was found by customs officials as she arrived for a holiday with her partner on 9 October. Her lawyer told Sky News that the idea she was a drug trafficker was illogical as she made no attempt to conceal what she was transporting. Her family had been told that she could face up to 25 years in jail, with one lawyer even mentioning the death penalty. Ms Plummer's local MP, Karl Turner, admitted the result could have been much worse, but still described it as ""devastating"". He told Sky News: ""She's been very anxious, she's suffered sleep deprivation, she's not been well in terms of her mental health and her physical health."" Mr Turner also urged Egyptian authorities to ""think very hard about what this means to people in the UK who are considering travelling (there)"". Ms Synclair added: ""It's affected all our lives. To hear your dad crying on the phone every day, to see your mum in a state. When you go to see Laura, she's in a mess - how can you do this to a young girl? ""She's a normal, nice person. She goes work, she comes home, she watches telly, she goes to bed, she doesn't smoke, she doesn't drink, she doesn't go out. ""She's faithful to Omar. That's her life. She's a normal person."" A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We will continue to provide assistance to Laura and her family following the court ruling in Egypt, and our embassy is in regular contact with the Egyptian authorities."""

Mr Johnson will warn that free speech is a key part of university life when he speaks at the Limmud Festival in Birmingham, a celebration of Jewish learning and culture. ""Universities should be places that open minds, not close them, where ideas can be freely challenged,"" he will say. ""In universities in America and worryingly in the UK, we have seen examples of groups seeking to stifle those who do not agree with them. ""We must not allow this to happen."" He will warn that young people should have the ""resilience and confidence"" to challenge controversial opinions and be able to have ""open, frank and rigorous discussions"". However, he will add that institutions must ensure there is no place for hatred, discrimination, extremism or racism. ""A racist or anti-Semitic environment is by definition an illiberal one that is completely in opposition to the liberal tradition of our universities,"" he will tell the festival. Mr Johnson will say a new regulator, the Office for Students, ""will go even further to ensure that universities promote freedom of speech within the law."" Under government plans, universities that fail to protect free speech risk possible sanction. The proposals, which are open for consultation, could also see universities facing fines, suspension and deregulation. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ""Universities are absolutely committed to promoting and securing free speech and will not allow legitimate speech to be stifled. ""There is already a legal duty on the higher education sector to secure free speech within the law and universities take these responsibilities very seriously."""

A Freedom of Information request from the Press Association showed more than £850,000 was awarded in the last four years. The TaxPayers' Alliance says the numbers ""paint a terrible picture"", while the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it robustly defends claims and is successful in two thirds of cases brought by inmates. The data shows 10,357 compensation payments were issued to inmates held at state prisons in England and Wales for lost and damaged property from 2013-14 to 2016-17. Six-figure sums were awarded in each of the four financial years, adding up to a total of £855,541.02. In 2014-15, payouts exceeded £300,000. Some recent cases of compensation being awarded for lost property include: A CD (£5.95) A DVD player (£60) An e-cigarette (£50) Hair clippers (£16) A rechargeable toothbrush (£19.99) A watch (£30) A duvet and duvet cover (£27) Toiletries (£4.09) A dressing gown (£20) Trainers (£35) Rules allow for inmates to lodge complaints and claims for compensation when property is lost or damaged. More than a quarter (29%) of complaints investigated by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman in 2016-17 related to lost or damaged property. In July, the watchdog warned that prisons are ""using scarce resources paying compensation for lost and damaged property"". Nigel Newcomen's final annual report as ombudsman said it was time for the prison service to ""get a grip on the way prisoners' property is managed"". The report added: ""The method of recording property needs to be brought into the 21st century; staff need time to follow the proper procedures; and prisoners' property needs to travel with them when they transfer between establishments (instead of following on weeks or months later)."" The total amounts paid out are: £199,086.98 in 2016-17; £190,191.71 in 2015-16; £313,347.70 in 2014-15; and £152,914.63 in 2013-14."

2017-12-26,"Hundreds of people have been arrested this year for having drugs formerly known as legal highs, new figures have revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171227012407/https://news.sky.com/story/800-people-arrested-after-ban-on-legal-highs-11186079,"A Sky News investigation found there were more than 800 arrests and around 270 people were charged or cautioned in the first 16 months of the Psychoactive Substances Act. Drugs including Spice, which can leave users in a zombie-like state, nitrous oxide and other substances called Pandora's Box, Blue Cheese and Monkey Dust were among those confiscated after legal highs were outlawed in May 2016. But charity Release has branded the law ""ineffective"" after two court cases linked to nitrous oxide - or laughing gas - collapsed when it was ruled the drug was exempt because it can be used for medical purposes. Police officers have also faced confusion about whether substances should be dealt with under the PSA after some former legal highs - such as Spice and Black Mamba - were re-classified as Class B controlled drugs, making possession illegal even without intent to supply, the charity said. Kirstie Douse, head of legal services at Release, told Sky News: ""Release considers the legislation to be fundamentally flawed because of the difficulty in proving the psychoactivity of many substances to the required legal standard, and we expect to see this challenged in future court cases across the UK. ""The one welcomed aspect is the fact that possession for personal use is not an offence under the PSA 2016. ""However, this inevitably leads to confusion for police officers in determining whether a substance falls within the remit of the PSA or the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971."" Sky News submitted freedom of information requests to all 45 police forces in the UK asking for details of crimes, arrests and charges under the PSA. :: 'Spice' drug fuelling prison debt and violence:: 'Chemsex' drugs and former legal highs targeted in crackdown Figures released by 41 forces revealed there were 805 arrests between May 2016 and September 2017, while 274 people were charged or cautioned in the same period. They included Britain's biggest force, the Metropolitan Police, which said 313 people had been arrested and 68 people were charged. Police Scotland said it had charged 18 people after recording crimes involving substances including Loop, Spun Out and Genesis. Greater Manchester Police, which in April said it was called to 58 incidents related to the drug Spice over one weekend, said it had carried out 101 arrests under the PSA and 54 people had been charged, cautioned, summoned to court or dealt with using restorative justice. The PSA was introduced after hundreds of deaths were linked to legal highs, which recreate similar effects to cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis. In 2015, new psychoactive substances were involved in 204 deaths in the UK - up 25% from 163 deaths in 2014. The Home Office, which previously revealed there were nearly 500 arrests in the first six months of the PSA, insisted the law was working. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""Psychoactive substances ruin lives and we owe it to all those who have lost loved ones to do everything we can to eradicate this harmful trade. ""The Psychoactive Substances Act is working. ""Since it came into force, hundreds of retailers across the United Kingdom have either closed down or are no longer selling these substances; police have arrested suppliers; and action by the National Crime Agency has resulted in the removal of psychoactive substances being sold by UK based websites."""

We had a briefing to say what information we had at the time. That was patchy, which made it quite difficult because we needed to announce to the waiting room that we were on a major incident. Obviously you don't want to tell the public anything that is going to frighten them if we didn't have the details. We had it confirmed that there had been a bombing. It sends chills down your spine. The time we knew just how significant this was was when the first patient came through. The level of injuries that patient had sustained was shocking. It gave a real clue as to the amount of trauma which must have occurred at the scene. I have seen a lot of trauma and we have seen a lot of difficult scenes but this was unusual because of the context and because of those injuries - we don't see them like that. We see trauma. We don't see blast injuries. I have never seen a blast injury in my career before. The patients that came in were in shock.

""I am mindful that we aren't the only ones who are suffering but Elaine would want us to all zip up our man suits - I like to call them McIver Girl suits! - and get on with it. ""We had an amazing and fantastic sisterly bond that will continue to live on inside me as long as I am breathing and until I join her one day when we can carry on the mischief together, wherever that may be.""  John Atkinson, 28 John was a support worker for people who had a stroke and for those on the autistic spectrum. His family said he and his partner Michael had been together for 15 years living in Radcliffe. Their tribute said: ""John loved life and he lived his life to the fullest"". He had recently gone on a diet and lost eight stone and would swim at his local leisure centre. The reverend at his funeral said he was a ""genuine role model to the people he supported"". Lisa Lees, 43 Lisa Lees was killed with her friend Alison Howe as they waited for their children to come out of the concert. She had been studying at Oldham College as a beauty tutor. She was buried at St Anne's where the Revd James Read said: ""She had so many plans for the future but she was taken on that awful, awful day."" Her brother, Lee Hunter, said: ""For those who don't know Lisa is gone but never ever forgotten I love you Lisa I'll miss you so much."" Angelika Klis, 39 The Polish national was at the arena with her husband Marcin to pick up the couple's daughters and take them back to the family home in York. More than £18,000 was raised by an online fundraising page in their memory, with the proceeds to go to their two daughters, Patrycia and Alex, who were aged 13 and 20 respectively at the time of the attack. Alex posted a desperate plea for help on Facebook following the attack as she had been unable to find her parents. The family held a private funeral at York Crematorium in June and said they were ""grateful"" for the outpouring of support they had received. In August, on what would have been Mrs Klis' 40th birthday, Alex posted on Facebook: ""Happy birthday to my queen✨ I remember how much you dreaded this big 40 and I remember how I'd always tell you we'll pretend it's your 18th again and throw you an 18th party. ""I can't comprehend the fact that I'll be celebrating your big milestone without you but I hope you have the best 18th up there, I'll have a drink for you (or a few) I love you all the world."" Marcin Klis, 42 Marcin was at the arena with his wife, Angelika, who also died in the attack, to pick up the couple's daughters and take them back to the family home in York. More than £18,000 was raised by an online fundraising page in their memory, with the proceeds to go to their two daughters, Patrycia and Alex, who were aged 13 and 20 respectively at the time of the attack. The family held a private funeral at York Crematorium in June and said they were ""grateful"" for the outpouring of support they had received. Phillip Tron, 32 Philip had travelled to Manchester to collect his partner's daughter, who was attending the Ariana Grande concert. From Gateshead, his funeral was held at St Mark's Methodist Church, where the theme from the film Top Gun was played. His partner said: ""My gorgeous crazy Philip, you made my world a happy place, and now you are both my angels flying high in the sky."" Mr Tron's mother described him as someone ""who would do anything for anyone"". ""Our most amazing son, partner, brother, father, uncle, nephew and cousin, Philip Tron, sadly passed away on the 22nd May 2017. ""Philip was such a fun-loving, energetic soul, he would light up the darkest room and lift your spirits with his infectious laugh, witty sense of humour and his beautiful smile. ""Words cannot express the huge void his passing has left in all our lives."" Jane Tweddle-Taylor, 51 Ms Tweddle-Taylor was waiting at the arena to pick up a friend's daughter. She was a receptionist at South Shore Academy in Blackpool, where colleagues described her as ""bubbly, kind, welcoming, funny and generous"". Principal Jane Bailey added: ""She is irreplaceable, much loved and will never be forgotten."" The Blackpool Tower was lit up in her name and in memory of all of the other victims. Her husband, former Hartlepool United, Blackpool and Wrexham footballer Mark Taylor, told BBC Lancashire that she was a ""very, very lovely lady and a very good mother"". He added: ""She was full of life and very energetic with the children, going to functions and all sort of different things like skiing. We had loads of happy times."" There were busy people rushing around and doing things but there wasn't the screaming, the noise of pain that you would expect to hear from injuries as massive as they were. There was a calmness in the patients. They were distressed but they recognised people were there to help. They weren't shouting out. They were receiving help, communicating quietly. I stood with a lady who needed somebody to hold her hand. My job as a matron, as a nurse, as a human being was to hold her hand, stay with her for what she needed. Holding someone's hand probably is the greatest gift you can do in a situation like that. To be able to reassure someone and tell them you are going to be there and it's going to be ok. I can see each and every patient's face that came through, so they all have different visions that stick in your head. There was a particular lady who asked me not to let her die. That's not a question that is uncommon for people to say to you but at that time, when you are holding someone's hand, you don't know if you can answer that question honestly or not. You just have to do your best to reassure them and give them hope and strength that we are doing everything that we possibly can. You don't forget things like that. You don't forget patients. That particular night, knowing that the injuries were so severe and knowing that person could very well die, seeing the look in her face where she just looked frightened, you don't forget that very easily. I think when you get home, that is when you take your armour down a little bit. That is where you start to really take on board what it is that you have just experienced and how huge that is. The effect of that is massive. I sat down. The house was really quiet. I made a cup of tea and it doesn't happen often but I cried, just taking on board everything that had happened. I'm not a hero. We were just doing our job. It's what we do. I think we've had lots of attention for what we did, but it is our job. I love my job. I love everything about it. It's heartening, I think, the response as a country. It makes me very proud to be part of the NHS. I think the responses that we have seen through all the tragedies this year have been very difficult. I think as a nation it feels like we have pulled together. It feels like people are taking a bit longer to say thank-you. I really feel that through this tragedy, what is coming out of it, is people are being resilient and standing together and being stronger as a result. :: A Surgeon's View - Barnes Morgan I received a phone call from one of my colleagues at Stepping Hill Hospital saying there had been a major incident, that we had a number of severely injured casualties and that our service was being overwhelmed and he needed help, basically. That was when I first realised the size of the incident. In fact that realisation became more and more apparent as I rushed my way into hospital to come and help out. I was listening to the news on the way in, where it became clear to me that we were involved in a very major-scale incident. I was flabbergasted, to be honest. It was like being on a war zone looking at the patients being seen. Short of any military experience, which I don't have, nothing can prepare you for that scale of injury on each individual patient and collectively as a group of patients. While I'm a medical professional and trained to be able to cope with injuries, and that's obviously what I do day in and day out, nothing takes away that human side of things, when you are seeing not only injured patients but their relatives who are dealing with this phenomenal emotional trauma. I was treating one patient. I was in hospital by 3.30am and remained treating that patient until sometime early the next morning. It was like seeing someone who had stepped on a land mine, (with) very severe injuries. The bomb that was involved was a type of shrapnel explosion and that just causes tremendous and widespread damage to patients' bodies. Normally when you are a consultant operating on a patient you are in a very small bubble of you and your patient. The rest of the world outside of the four walls of the operating theatre doesn't exist. But that night I think all of us were aware that there was something much bigger than you and this one patient involved. There was something going on almost identical to what you were doing in every other hospital in Manchester in several different operating theatres. It's very rare you have that feeling of collective experience. It's a night of horror that will always live with me but I feel really privileged that I had the skills to help people in their time of need, that I was in a place where I could be useful. I don't feel like a hero that night. I feel like somebody who was just very grateful that I was able to help out."

The victim, a 69-year-old pensioner, had withdrawn £1,000 cash from a branch of Lloyds Bank before getting into a lift to return to her daughter's car in the car park. When she got into the lift, two of the suspects pressed a different floor button and discussed the buttons pressed with the victim as the third suspect searched her handbag and removed the cash. When the victim returned to the car she realised her savings, which were in her purse, had been stolen. The first suspect is a white woman in her 40s with long dyed white hair. She was wearing a black leather jacket over a black and white chequered top, bleached blue jeans with holes in the knees and black shoes. The second is an Eastern European man in his 30s with short black hair. He was wearing a green jacket, blue jeans and blue trainers with white laces. The third suspect is an Eastern European man in is his 40s with receding short dark hair. He was wearing a grey suit jacket over a black top, blue jeans and blue trainers with white soles. He also had black rimmed glasses on his head. PC Carl Repper, from the East Area Command, said: ""We are appealing for any information as to the identity of these three suspects. ""The victim has lost a large amount of her savings as a result of her ordeal."" Anyone who can assist the investigation is asked to contact East Area Command via 101 or by Tweeting @MetCC.

2017-12-26,A British woman accused of smuggling drugs into Egypt has been jailed for three years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171227012407/https://news.sky.com/story/briton-laura-plummer-jailed-for-three-years-in-egypt-for-drug-smuggling-11184683,"Laura Plummer, 33, a shop worker from Hull, was arrested as she entered the country in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada carrying 320 tramadol tablets in her suitcase. Her family said they were for her Egyptian partner, Omar Caboo, who suffers from severe back pain and claimed Ms Plummer, who they describe as ""daft"", had no idea what she was doing was illegal. Tramadol, a painkiller, is a class C drug that is banned in Egypt but legal in the UK. However, it is only available when prescribed by a doctor or other healthcare professional and it is illegal for anyone else to supply it. Laura's sister, Rachel, said her mother, Roberta Sinclair, who travelled to Egypt for the hearings, was distraught over the sentence. She said: ""My mum's obviously devastated. She's out there by herself."" The family have lodged an immediate appeal, but Rachel said she did not know whether it would be heard on Tuesday. She said: ""We're just hoping. Even half of that would be better. Anything less than three years. She doesn't deserve that."" The family said Ms Plummer made no attempt to hide the medicine, which she was given by a friend, when she was searched by customs officials as she arrived for a holiday with her partner on 9 October. Ms Plummer appeared in court on Christmas Day, but the case was adjourned due to the condition she was in, according to her sister, who described her as ""sleep deprived"", ""visibly nervous"" and ""upset"". A Facebook group set up by her family announced that she appeared in court on Boxing Day and was jailed for three years. Mrs Sinclair said her daughter was sharing a communal cell with no beds with up to 25 other women in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada, where she was arrested at the airport. Her family had been told that she could face up to 25 years in jail, with one lawyer even mentioning the death penalty. Ms Plummer's local MP, Karl Turner, admitted the result could have been much worse, but still described it as ""devastating"". He told Sky News: ""She's been very anxious, she's suffered sleep deprivation, she's not been well in terms of her mental health and her physical health."" Mr Turner also urged Egyptian authorities to ""think very hard about what this means to people in the UK who are considering travelling (there)"". And of the police cell where Ms Plummer was being held, he said: ""Frankly, for anyone the conditions would be shocking but for a young woman who has never so much as committed a parking violation, this experience will be utterly shocking to her."" The Hull East MP added: ""I've got a lot of confidence in the British Foreign Office. I think they've dealt with this case particularly well. ""Boris Johnson has himself taken a particular interest in this case and had meetings with Government ministers about it. I'm hoping that good sense and decency will prevail."" A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We will continue to provide assistance to Laura and her family following the court ruling in Egypt, and our embassy is in regular contact with the Egyptian authorities."""

Wearing a light brown coat and brown hat, with warm boots and a bag, Ms Markle walked arm-in-arm with Prince Harry and waved to waiting crowds, as they made the short journey from Sandringham House. Her Majesty was in attendance having missed last year's service with a cold, as was husband Prince Philip. Just before the group headed off to the church, Ms Markle was seen to curtsy before the Queen, prompting a furious flurry of picture taking from the waiting press photographers. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were also at the service, with hundreds of people having gathered to witness the family's arrival and some calling out ""Merry Christmas"" as they walked past. Among the onlookers were American couple Ashley Millican and Michael Metz, who got engaged live on Sky News as they waited for the Royals to arrive. Sky's Royal Correspondent Rhiannon Mills said: ""I suspect there are a few people at home who are thinking, why on earth would I want to leave my nice, warm, comfy house and my nice Christmas presents and stand outside in the cold. ""But there have literally been thousands of people this morning who have been queuing up to try and get inside the gates of the Sandringham estate. It's been an unbelievable scene, really. ""I suspect some of it is to do with the Meghan Markle effect. This is one of the rare occasions people will be able to see Meghan before Harry and Meghan get married in May. ""People have also talked about the fact that it has been very important to see the Queen as well, who last year was too unwell to go to church on Christmas morning."" Prince William and Kate mingled with the crowds outside once the service came to a close, with the Royals then returning home for a traditional festive lunch. Later they were expected to watch the Queen's annual Christmas address, whichthis year focused on remembering those affected by the traumatic events of 2017, including the Grenfell Tower fire, the Manchester Arena bombing, and the terror attacks in London."

Following the latest incident, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the UK would ""never be intimidated"" when it came to protecting the country. It comes just days after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson clashed with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov over alleged cyber attacks on the West and activity in Ukraine. Portsmouth-based HMS St Albans set sail on 23 December and remained at sea on Christmas Day to keep track of the Russian frigate ""in areas of national interest"", the MoD said. On Christmas Eve, patrol ship HMS Tyne was called to escort a Russian intelligence-gathering ship travelling through the North Sea and the English Channel. A Royal Navy Wildcat helicopter was also dispatched to monitor another two Russian vessels during the festive period. Mr Williamson, who is reportedly fighting cuts to the MoD budget, said: ""I will not hesitate in defending our waters or tolerate any form of aggression.

Although a party spokesperson told Sky News that they would not ""comment on any honours list speculation"", his new title is expected to be formally announced on Saturday. A fierce campaigner for Remain in the EU referendum, Mr Clegg's award will likely rile ardent Brexiters. Leave champion Nigel Farage claimed last week he was being left out of the 2018 list because of his politics. He told the Daily Telegraph: ""Of course I have not got an honour of any kind - I am not a Remainer. ""Every one of them got CBEs, they got knighthoods, quite extraordinary."" Mr Clegg's honour comes after he lost his Sheffield Hallam constituency in June's snap General Election. He was beaten by Labour's Jared O'Mara, who is currently suspended by the party pending investigation of historical offensive online comments. A new Lib Dem candidate has already been selected for the seat and Mr Clegg himself said he did not want to stand for re-election nor be given a peerage, meaning his exit from Parliament is at least semi-permanent. A former MEP, Mr Clegg became leader of the Lib Dems in 2007, briefly inspiring a wave of 'Cleggmania' that failed to translate into as many seats as expected in the 2010 election. In that year's hung parliament, he sided with the Tories in a coalition deal, installing David Cameron in Number 10 and becoming his deputy for five years."
2017-12-26,A charity has warned that disabled people are being let down by high street retailers - and Sky News witnessed the problems they face first-hand during a shopping trip with a terror attack victim.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171227012407/https://news.sky.com/story/high-street-chains-exposed-on-shopping-trip-with-disabled-person-11184435,"A survey by Scope revealed that three quarters of disabled people and their families had left a shop or business because it did not properly cater for them. This is despite it being a legal requirement that reasonable adjustments are made to premises to make them accessible for disabled shoppers. The charity estimates that businesses could be missing out on a share of £60m a day because their shops or websites are not accessible. Scope's James Taylor said disabled people had reported a range of issues including a lack of ramps, shops having no hearing loops and ""attitudinal problems from staff"". He said: ""At Scope we do think this is a big issue that's impacting on disabled people being able to take part in the community, go to the shops, buy their Christmas presents, go out at night, but also it's impacting on businesses as well."" Sky News went shopping on London's Tottenham Court Road with Will Pike, who was paralysed after he fell 60ft fleeing terrorists in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. Last year he filmed his own video on the same street called 'Yes I Can' to highlight the difficulties he faces going out. We visited a Pret a Manger cafe where the disabled access ramp was too steep and a Caffe Nero outlet which did not have a bell for disabled people to alert staff or a ramp that was fit for purpose. In a Waterstone's store, stock was so closely packed together in part of the shop that Will could not avoid knocking over merchandise with his wheelchair. ""This is precisely the reason that guys in wheelchairs, girls in wheelchairs, will avoid the high street at Christmas,"" Will said. ""It takes a lot of confidence in general to leave the house, to embrace the day, to get involved with stuff, so at a peak shopping time like Christmas it ramps it up. ""It doesn't seem to be that disability, or inclusivity or accessibility, whatever you want to call it, is high on anyone's agenda."" Following our filming, Pret a Manger agreed to check all accessibility ramps in their stores across the country. ""Our health and safety team have investigated and they agree that the gradient of the ramp at our Tottenham Court Road shop is too steep,"" a spokesperson said. ""A new ramp has been ordered and will be fitted in the next few weeks. We will review all the ramps in our shops across the country. ""We are also reminding all shop teams of their disabled access and support training to ensure disabled access is provided to customers as quickly as possible."" Caffe Nero said it will review the Tottenham Court Road store's ramp and ensure that a call bell is added. ""Caffe Nero recognises the importance of ensuring that no one is subjected to less favourable treatment because they are disabled,"" a spokesperson said. ""Staff are trained to ensure that the dignity of any disabled customer is respected when providing them with services."" :: Premier League defends record in improving facilities for disabled fans:: Charity's anger at PM's dismissal of Philip Hammond disability row A Waterstone's spokesperson said: ""We arrange our bookshops in a way that makes disabled access as easy as possible, given the constraints of displaying the books and other products we sell, and the layout of the shop. ""As a customer-focused business, we seek always to go beyond our strict legal obligations, and do all that we can to be inclusive and accessible to all. ""Our booksellers are trained to always think of our customers' needs and to assist proactively and reactively wherever possible."" Marks and Spencer also acknowledged it could do more to ensure disabled people have easy access in its stores after we filmed the difficulties a wheelchair user faced. ""We work hard to make our stores accessible for everyone,"" a spokesperson said. ""We're proud of our inclusive design policy and have led the way on a number of initiatives such as becoming the first retailer to share DisabledGo 'Access Guides'. ""However, we know there's more we can do. We're always listening to our customers and colleagues."" Mike Adams, chief executive of disability organisation Purple, is working with some retailers to highlight that disabled people can be a lucrative customer base if stores make small alterations. He said: ""What we're saying to businesses is, see disabled people as a commercial opportunity, provide really good customer services and you will reap the rewards in terms of your bottom line, and that will be the driver to think about employing disabled people in the workforce."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has called for more legal powers to do spot checks on businesses, saying high street shops have a ""legal duty to make sure they can be accessed by disabled people"". ""High street chains need to stop treating disability access as an optional extra,"" a spokesman said. ""This is why we would like the power to enter and inspect premises where disability access requirements are being ignored."""

So far there have been no leads to help officials in the US trying to track down 13 works stolen in 1990. The paintings, by artists including Rembrandt, Manet and Degas, were lost when two men masquerading as police officers blagged their way into the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. They claimed to be responding to reports of a disturbance, but ended up handcuffing two security guards in the basement and making off with the paintings. FBI investigators believe the artworks were smuggled out of Massachusetts and moved around the country in mob circles. But the thieves can no longer be prosecuted - even if they are caught - because of a five year statute of limitation. Kathy Sharpless, a spokesperson for the museum, said they were ""laser-focused"" on the impending deadline. ""Clearly there's a sense of urgency on our part,"" she admitted. ""We want our paintings back."" ""We're really not interested in theories as much as in good credible information and facts. ""It only takes one good piece of information to help solve this puzzle."" Among the missing paintings are Rembrandt's only known seascape, Christ in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and Vermeer's The Concert, one of fewer than 40 known paintings by the 17th-century Dutch painter. Despite the theft taking place 27 years ago, there are still empty frames on the walls of the museum where they were once hung. The reward offered was $5m for years, but the museum doubled it towards the end of 2017."

However bargain-hunters were still out in force in some places, with queues forming outside Selfridges in central London from 2.30am while intu, the owner of some of Britain's biggest shopping centres, reported a big rise in footfall. The wider drop in shopping trips to physical stores comes as consumers increasingly turn online for their purchases. November's Black Friday event has also been blamed for bringing forward store discounting from the traditional Boxing Day period. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""We did anticipate a drop in footfall on Boxing Day this year, but the scale of the drop is greater than expected. ""Given that last year footfall declined by 1.4% up to 5pm, but dropped by 2.3% over the 24 hour period as a whole, we are now expecting footfall to decline by more than 4% compared with last year over the day as a whole. ""The drop in footfall - the fifth out of the past six years - reinforces the lessening of the importance of Boxing Day as a key trading day in the retail calendar"". The Springboard figures showed a 5.8% decline for high street shopping visits, a 4% downturn for shopping centres and a 2% drop at out of town locations. Online sales fared better and some shoppers were already spending on Christmas Day itself, with sales on 25 December up 5% on last year according to ecommerce trends experts PCA Predict. They were forecast to be up 6.2% for Boxing Day. Currys PC World said more than a quarter of a million customers logged on in one hour on Tuesday morning, with 63% using phones to place orders. Selfridges said that after three hours trading on Boxing Day from 9am it had registered £4m in sales at its London, Birmingham and Manchester stores and online and it was expecting a record-breaking day. Barclaycard has predicted that 34% of Britons will go to the festive sales, up from 23% last year. It found that after months of ""feeling the squeeze"" amid rising inflation and weak pay growth, many consumers were looking forward to taking advantage of discounts. Intu, owner of shopping centres including Gateshead's Metrocentre, Manchester's Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, reported an 8.5% rise in footfall by mid-afternoon.

It ended the session at 7620.7, 28 points up on its opening mark and a new closing high. The rally was supported by an upturn in copper and other commodity prices, which helped to lift global mining giants including Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Glencore. Demand for commodities implies optimism about the outlook for rapidly advancing world economies such as China. Greg McKenna, chief strategist at AxiTrader, said: ""The rally in copper supports expectations that 2018 is going to be a strong year for synchronised global growth."" Other world markets were also ahead. The FTSE 100's latest rally leaves it nearly 500 points higher than at the end of 2016. Its performance this year reflects global conditions affecting its internationally-focused businesses rather than the health of the UK economy. Sentiment has been buoyed in recent weeks by the passage of a $1.5tn tax cut plan in Washington. The index has also been helped this year by the weakness of the pound - which means the dollar and euro earnings of its global constituents are worth more when translated back into sterling."

The opiate is illegal in Egypt but available on prescription in the UK. The Foreign Office has now said it is looking into the possibility that she could be moved to a different prison. Laura's sister Jayne Synclair has described the conditions in which she was held before her trial as a ""living hell"" and fears they will be even worse in jail. Until now, Laura's family has been paying someone to take her food three times a week because she ""doesn't have the character"" to fight her way to a share of food which is thrown on to the cell floor once a day. Female prisoners are held 25 to a cell with a small hole in the floor as a toilet. Ms Synclair told Sky News that Laura had been subjected to intimidation by the other prisoners. The family are to appeal against her conviction but under Egyptian law have to wait 60 days before they can apply to the court. The 33-year-old from Hull was arrested as she arrived in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in October. The family said a friend gave Ms Plummer the Tramadol tablets, which were found by customs officials as she arrived for a holiday with her partner on 9 October. Her lawyer told Sky News that the idea she was a drug trafficker was illogical as she made no attempt to conceal what she was transporting. Her family had been told that she could face up to 25 years in jail, with one lawyer even mentioning the death penalty. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We will continue to provide assistance to Laura and her family following the court ruling in Egypt, and our embassy is in regular contact with the Egyptian authorities."""

The court heard he wanted to use the phone to make private calls to Miss McCann, who was pregnant with their child at the time. The banned items were found when a prison officer removed the rubber stopper from the bottom of the crutch during a cell search. Collins had been using the crutch after hurting his feet trying to escape police while on the run for the acid attack at the Mangle nightclub in Dalston, east London in April. The court heard evidence was later found on the phone of calls and messages to family and friends. Collins' lawyer, Audrey Mogan, said: ""He did not have the phone for any sinister purpose. His partner at the time was heavily pregnant and gave birth the following November. ""He had this phone because he and his partner had been hounded by the media. He knows there was a phone in the cell but he knows the calls are recorded. Because of that he was afraid that information would get out to the media."" District judge Robert Hunter committed Collins' case to Woolwich Crown Court for sentencing on a date to be fixed. He is currently serving a 20 year sentence."

As Dr Strangelove himself puts it: ""Of course, the whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh?"" The UK has been telling the world about its deterrent cyberweapon program since at least 2011, when it first acknowledged the program. Since then, we've seen numerous and devastating hacks from nation states including Russia, Iran and North Korea. One wonders how effective that UK deterrent has been. So the UK has decided to tell the world about its cyberweapons again. Boris Johnson has told the Russians that we will retaliate against cyberattacks. And in the Intelligence and Security Committee's annual review of the intelligence agencies, published this week, GCHQ said it was developing a ""full spectrum"" of offensive capabilities. GCHQ said that ranged from ""technical stuff... right through to what we would say is the high end of counter-state offensive cybercapabilities which might never be used, and everything in between."" What might those weapons look like in real life? The Times reports techniques including ""the ability to make another country's warplanes, ships and missiles malfunction and to infect a mobile phone to suck up information or wipe the memory"". In fact, we've seen examples of exactly that - from the Russians. Hacking into phones is on the low end of what nation-states are capable of. But in June, ships in the Black Sea were sent off course because their GPS signals were spoofed. Many systems - including missiles and drones - rely on GPS (although not entirely). Or take power stations. Ukraine's power grid has been shut down by cyberattacks twice in the last two years. Officials there have blamed Russia for the sabotage. For an example of what a Western cyberweapon might be capable of, you need to look, counter-intuitively, at North Korea. This week, the UK and USA officially blamed it for the Wannacry ransomware attack which spread rapidly around the world earlier this year. But its fearsome success was partly because it used tools developed by the US National Security Agency. Those tools were stolen, leaked publicly, then exploited by the North Koreans. The UK's cyber arsenal should at least match those capabilities, given GCHQ's expertise and funding levels."

A team led by maths professor Valentina Zharkova at Northumbria University built on work from Moscow to predict the movements of two magnetic waves produced by the Sun. It predicts rapidly decreasing magnetic waves for three solar cycles beginning in 2021 and lasting 33 years. Very low magnetic activity on the Sun correspond with historically documented cold periods on Earth. Professor Zharkova claims 97% accuracy for the model which dovetails with previous mini ice ages, including the Maunder Minimum period from 1645 to 1715 when frost fairs were held on the frozen Thames. But she cautions that her mathematical research cannot be used as proof that there will be a mini ice age this time around, not least because of global warming. ""I hope global warning will be overridden by this effect, giving humankind and the Earth 30 years to sort out our pollution,"" she said. But Professor Zharkova warned that any downward impact on global warming will last only until the Sun's two magnetic waves become active again in the 2050s. ""We have to be sorted by that time and prepare everything on Earth for the next big solar activity,"" she said."

Eight construction companies were given the chance to produce their example of a wall that would work. Officials from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are now testing those offerings. The wall was one of Mr Trump's dominant campaign promises but few believe building it along 2,000 miles of border is realistic or feasible. However, the CBP, which would have responsibility for the wall, says its existence sends a psychological message. ""The attention that these prototypes have brought to a worldwide audience has given us the ability to send the message,"" said CBP division chief Mario Villarreal. ""The message that we're a wonderful country, the greatest country in the world, and to those who want to come to the United States we highly recommend that they choose legal methods."" But opponents of the wall say it sends a very different message. Enrique Morones has run Border Angels since the 1980s, advocating for human rights and humane immigration reform. He said: ""Without a doubt, it is a wall of hate. It tells the world, 'Do as I say, not as I do.' ""We know that the majority of the population of the United States is against the wall. There isn't the money for it, it is just for show."" US officials say the building of the existing physical barrier between the US and Mexico in the San Diego area has slashed the numbers trying to cross illegally. In 1986, 628,000 people were apprehended making the attempt. Last year it was just 31,000. But campaigners say the result of people trying to find alternative routes has been an increase in deaths among would-be migrants. At San Diego's Friendship Park, families divided by the border regularly meet on either side to talk through the fence. Recently, for only the sixth time ever, officials opened a gate in the fence to allow a few families to reunite briefly. Brian Houston and Evelia Reyes used their three minutes together to get married. Brian said: ""We were very fortunate to be reunited and show that love has no borders. I wish the fence wasn't there. ""I think it is really sad, it is dividing families, dividing people, I don't understand the reasons for it."""

One official told the TV network: ""Anthrax antibodies have been found in the North Korean soldier who defected this year."" North Korea has been suspected of developing biological weapons after the regime revealed the work of the Pyongyang Biological Technology Research Institute in 2015, run by the Korean People's Army Unit 810. The regime has claimed the facility specialises in pesticide research, but analysts have said dual-use equipment on the site suggests biological weapons are being manufactured. A report earlier this month claimed Pyongyang is testing biological weapons with the aim of loading anthrax-laded warheads on its intercontinental ballistic missiles. :: North Korea's chemical warfare capabilities Japan's Asahi newspaper reported that the US was aware of the tests, which were being carried out to determine whether the anthrax bacteria could survive the high temperatures on re-entry from space. North Korea denied the claims and said it would ""take revenge"" on the US for claiming it was developing biological weapons. The discovery of anthrax antibodies has raised tensions in Seoul. The South Korean military has not yet issued an anthrax vaccine. Defence ministry spokesman Choi Hyun Soo has said a vaccine ""is expected to be developed by the end of 2019"". Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It can be contracted through the skin, lungs, intestines or through an injection. :: N Korea 'developing missiles that could hit London' Symptoms include raised spots or blisters on the skin, fever and chills, shortness of breath, chest pains and shock. Airborne infection of the disease is the most deadly and can kill quickly if not treated immediately. It can be treated with antibiotics. In response to ICBM tests by the North Korea regime, the UN Security Council unanimously passed new sanctions last week. North Korea claimed the sanctions, which restrict vital oil supplies, were a complete economic blockade and an ""act of war"".

Mr Williamson, who is reportedly fighting cuts to the MoD budget, said: ""I will not hesitate in defending our waters or tolerate any form of aggression.

Lancashire Police said the driver of the Corsa failed to stop at the scene but the car was later recovered in nearby Cliff Street. Investigations are under way to identify the driver, officers said. In a statement, Ms Shaw's family said: ""She was well known within the local community in Rishton and spent a lot of time on local charitable causes, particularly Switched-On Rishton, which raises money throughout the year for Christmas lights and decorations throughout the town. ""Susan was very creative and enjoyed crafting. She would sell items she had made to raise money for Switched-On Rishton. ""Susan was a loving mother of two and also a much-loved daughter and sister and she will be sorely missed by all who knew her. ""She was always generous with her time with friends and strangers alike and was loved by everyone."" It later emerged that a friend had set up a fundraising website to help support her offspring - both believed to be aged in their 20s. The Gofundme page, set up by friend Debbie Hudson, said: ""Funds will go towards funeral cost and caring for her two disabled children."" Police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, has been informed and the victim's family is being supported by specially trained officers. Detective Inspector Warren Atkinson said: ""We have now launched a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident. ""We would ask anyone who witnessed the pursuit or who may be able to help us to identify the driver to contact us as we continue with our inquiries. ""Our thoughts remain with the family of the victim at this sad time."" Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting log reference 1204 of 26 December."
2017-12-27,"Hundreds of people have been arrested this year for having drugs formerly known as legal highs, new figures have revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171228014119/https://news.sky.com/story/800-people-arrested-after-ban-on-legal-highs-11186079,"A Sky News investigation found there were more than 800 arrests and around 270 people were charged or cautioned in the first 16 months of the Psychoactive Substances Act. Drugs including Spice, which can leave users in a zombie-like state, nitrous oxide and other substances called Pandora's Box, Blue Cheese and Monkey Dust were among those confiscated after legal highs were outlawed in May 2016. But charity Release has branded the law ""ineffective"" after two court cases linked to nitrous oxide - or laughing gas - collapsed when it was ruled the drug was exempt because it can be used for medical purposes. Police officers have also faced confusion about whether substances should be dealt with under the PSA after some former legal highs - such as Spice and Black Mamba - were re-classified as Class B controlled drugs, making possession illegal even without intent to supply, the charity said. Kirstie Douse, head of legal services at Release, told Sky News: ""Release considers the legislation to be fundamentally flawed because of the difficulty in proving the psychoactivity of many substances to the required legal standard, and we expect to see this challenged in future court cases across the UK. ""The one welcomed aspect is the fact that possession for personal use is not an offence under the PSA 2016. ""However, this inevitably leads to confusion for police officers in determining whether a substance falls within the remit of the PSA or the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971."" Sky News submitted freedom of information requests to all 45 police forces in the UK asking for details of crimes, arrests and charges under the PSA. :: 'Spice' drug fuelling prison debt and violence:: 'Chemsex' drugs and former legal highs targeted in crackdown Figures released by 41 forces revealed there were 805 arrests between May 2016 and September 2017, while 274 people were charged or cautioned in the same period. They included Britain's biggest force, the Metropolitan Police, which said 313 people had been arrested and 68 people were charged. Police Scotland said it had charged 18 people after recording crimes involving substances including Loop, Spun Out and Genesis. Greater Manchester Police, which in April said it was called to 58 incidents related to the drug Spice over one weekend, said it had carried out 101 arrests under the PSA and 54 people had been charged, cautioned, summoned to court or dealt with using restorative justice. The PSA was introduced after hundreds of deaths were linked to legal highs, which recreate similar effects to cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis. In 2015, new psychoactive substances were involved in 204 deaths in the UK - up 25% from 163 deaths in 2014. The Home Office, which previously revealed there were nearly 500 arrests in the first six months of the PSA, insisted the law was working. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""Psychoactive substances ruin lives and we owe it to all those who have lost loved ones to do everything we can to eradicate this harmful trade. ""The Psychoactive Substances Act is working. ""Since it came into force, hundreds of retailers across the United Kingdom have either closed down or are no longer selling these substances; police have arrested suppliers; and action by the National Crime Agency has resulted in the removal of psychoactive substances being sold by UK based websites."""

Frustrated travellers slammed airlines and the airport for a lack of information - with many reporting being stuck on planes for hours, late notice of cancellations and troubles getting their luggage back. Lana Briggs, who flew into Stansted from Dublin with a young child, said she had been left without her bags after hours of delays and received ""very little information"" from the airport or her airline. She told Sky News: ""People are talking about; 'It's going to descend into a riot if we don't get more information.' I'm sure it's not going to happen but it does feel pretty devastating at the moment. ""It's definitely tense. ""Mums and babies are on the floor. There are families kipping on suitcase carriers and even on some of the baggage belts that aren't working at the moment. ""All the local hotels are booked up."" Meanwhile, passenger Fiona Davidson tweeted: ""@Ryanair my 13 year old daughter was left sitting on the same plane for 8 hours, no explanation, no refreshments... shocking service.""

An accident in treacherous conditions closed the M1 for several hours on Wednesday morning, before it reopened at 12.30pm. The lorry crash closed all three lanes southbound before junction 19, with Leicestershire Police telling Sky News it was likely caused by the wintry conditions. The worst of the snow fell across the Midlands and parts of Wales - with motoring organisations reporting a surge in minor bumps and breakdowns. The RAC said it attended ""a dozen vehicles"" on the M25 alone - blaming a large pothole for causing punctures and wheel damage. The seasonal weather hit as many people prepared to return to work after a short Christmas break. The worst disruption was on the A14 in Suffolk, which was hit by heavy snow and flooding. Drivers there were understood to have been stuck for more than five hours. Meanwhile, engineers were rushed to restore power to more than 24,000 homes. A build-up of snow and ice on power lines was blamed for bringing them down. According to the Met Office, temperatures are set to plunge across much of the UK overnight into Thursday. It issued yellow warnings for ice covering England, Wales, the east of Northern Ireland and northern and western Scotland."

The pay squeeze which saw real wages fall back in 2017 is set to come to an end but a ""noticeable"" year-on-year rise in real pay is not forecast until December next year, the RF said. Real pay remains £15-a-week below its peak before the global financial crash of 2008 and is not expected to recover to its pre-crisis levels until 2025. The RF said more than half of the public expect their pay to remain the same or fall over the next 12 months if they stay in the same job. One in seven said they were expecting a pay increase, while around a quarter of households expect their financial situation will worsen over the course of the year. However, the RF said the lowest paid workers were set for a 4.3% pay rise in April as the national living wage reaches £7.83. RF director Torsten Bell said 2017 was a ""tough year for living standards as the pay squeeze returned"". ""The good news is that things will get better next year,"" he said. ""The bad news is we may only go from backwards to standing still, with prospects for a meaningful pay recovery still out of sight."" Responding to the RF, the Treasury said it was ""helping families to earn more and keep more of what they earn"". ""Our national living wage is delivering the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years and we are cutting taxes for millions of people,"" a spokesman said."

""In the Peak District, there are lots of holiday homes used as pop-up brothels. The organised criminals bring the vulnerable women in and then use a cottage for business. They stay for four weeks and make a lot of money."" He says women are coming to Derby having been promised there are jobs for them, but they arrive to discover there are no such jobs. ""This is a serious criminal business. They are placed and forced to work in brothels because the work they were promised does not exist, they have very limited grasp of the language and have no money,"" he said. Dr Redfern campaigns against the trafficking of young women, and says the problem is getting worse. ""They are being treated like animals. Their treatment is horrific. This is happening in our communities. They have one bath and one toilet between 20 of them. It's just awful,"" he says.

The court heard he wanted to use the phone to make private calls to Miss McCann, who was pregnant with their child at the time. The banned items were found when a prison officer removed the rubber stopper from the bottom of the crutch during a cell search. Collins had been using the crutch after hurting his feet trying to escape police while on the run for the acid attack at the Mangle nightclub in Dalston, east London in April. The court heard evidence was later found on the phone of calls and messages to family and friends. Collins' lawyer, Audrey Mogan, said: ""He did not have the phone for any sinister purpose. His partner at the time was heavily pregnant and gave birth the following November. ""He had this phone because he and his partner had been hounded by the media.

The Met Office predicts accumulations of up to 10cm (4ins) are likely and up to 15cm (6ins) could fall over higher ground. ""Travel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers. Some delays and cancellations to rail and air travel are likely,"" the Met Office warned. ""There is a possibility that some rural communities could become temporarily cut off. Power cuts may also occur."" A yellow warning for snow has also been issued for southern and eastern Scotland, northern England and the Midlands. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: ""The coldest temperature we have seen this year is minus 13C in Scotland, and we are likely to see temperatures slightly below that,"" she added. ""But we are not talking about those extremes in the town and city centres, it is out in rural areas, more exposed areas, particularly over lying snow where you see temperatures drop the most.""

Stansted temporarily closed its runway twice due to ice, resulting in 27 inbound and 27 outbound flights being cancelled. Around 50 flights were also cancelled at Luton. Roughly 300 passengers were left in the terminal at Stansted waiting to rebook flights on Wednesday evening after dozens of Ryanair services were cancelled, along with a number of easyJet flights. Lana Briggs, who had flown into Stansted from Dublin, told Sky News her aircraft was held on the runway for an hour and she was not told when her luggage would be unloaded. She said: ""People are talking about it turning into a riot if we don't get more information. I'm sure it's not going to happen but it does feel pretty devastating at the moment.

It is the brainwave of tech entrepreneur Alex Stephany, who wanted to help tackle the growing problem of homelessness. He told Sky News: ""The question I asked originally was why can I not take a couple of pounds in my pocket and do something smarter and more long-term to help someone than just buying them a coffee."" Each homeless person on Beam, or member as they are known, has to show potential to succeed in training and work. They are helped to find the right training courses, and Beam sets them up with a fundraising page. The website went live in September and it has already helped nine people reach their fundraising targets. One of the first to be funded was Tony Elie, from east London, Beam raised £4,378 to pay for his City and Guilds electrician qualification. After ten years living in hostels, which made him ""lose enthusiasm for life"", Mr Elie says things are finally looking up. ""Basically I feel unstoppable now because I know where I'm going, the training's ongoing and I know what's ahead of me,"" he said. ""Things are looking really fantastic."" Beam's website is simple to use, and includes pictures and profiles of all members, including how they ended up homeless. It also itemises where the money will be spent so people can see exactly what they're paying for. Mr Stephany believes the website helps create a connection between the user and the homeless person. He said: ""Crowdfunding has never really been used to its full potential to tackle homelessness as a problem and what we've built is a model that allows anyone to give responsibly to help a homeless person to leave homelessness for good."" Beam members are all recommended by support workers from homeless charities like Thames Reach. Chief executive Jeremy Swain says it is a brilliant new way of positively helping the homeless. ""We can see the impact on those individuals and the way it's changing their lives, we're getting people into work which is exactly what we need to be doing,"" he told Sky News. ""Every homelessness charity should be not only getting people into accommodation but getting them into work too."" Mr Elie says 2018 could be the year he moves into his own home, something he's long dreamed about. ""It's made such a difference to me,"" he said. ""It's given me some ambition and I've just got the drive to succeed now to hurry up and get out of a hostel and get my accommodation and get on the ladder in the work environment."""

London was hit by four major terrorist incidents in 2017, including March's attack on the palace of Westminster which saw five people including PC Keith Palmer killed, and June's attack at London Bridge, which left eight people including three terrorists dead. ""We will have the right response of officers at the right locations; this will be a mix of overt and covert officers deployed, as well as dogs, and the use of CCTV and automatic number plate recognition,"" says Mr Aldworth. ""People can expect to see armed officers in the area, and we will be using vehicle barriers across the event area. ""Security is paramount for us, and so we ask for patience and co-operation when getting through the check and search points."" There will also be a strong security presence around Greater Manchester for the New Year's Eve celebrations.

2017-12-28,"In Dr Strangelove, deterrence is defined as ""the art of producing in the mind of the enemy… the fear to attack"". Deterrence only works if the enemy knows about the deterrent. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171229015502/https://news.sky.com/story/what-would-a-cyberwar-between-the-uk-and-russia-look-like-11180856,"Things go south in that film because the USSR develops a superweapon, the Doomsday machine, in complete secrecy. As Dr Strangelove himself puts it: ""Of course, the whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh?"" The UK has been telling the world about its deterrent cyberweapon program since at least 2011, when it first acknowledged the program. Since then, we've seen numerous and devastating hacks from nation states including Russia, Iran and North Korea. One wonders how effective that UK deterrent has been. So the UK has decided to tell the world about its cyberweapons again. Boris Johnson has told the Russians that we will retaliate against cyberattacks. And in the Intelligence and Security Committee's annual review of the intelligence agencies, published this week, GCHQ said it was developing a ""full spectrum"" of offensive capabilities. GCHQ said that ranged from ""technical stuff... right through to what we would say is the high end of counter-state offensive cybercapabilities which might never be used, and everything in between."" What might those weapons look like in real life? The Times reports techniques including ""the ability to make another country's warplanes, ships and missiles malfunction and to infect a mobile phone to suck up information or wipe the memory"". In fact, we've seen examples of exactly that - from the Russians. Hacking into phones is on the low end of what nation-states are capable of. But in June, ships in the Black Sea were sent off course because their GPS signals were spoofed. Many systems - including missiles and drones - rely on GPS (although not entirely). Or take power stations. Ukraine's power grid has been shut down by cyberattacks twice in the last two years. Officials there have blamed Russia for the sabotage. For an example of what a Western cyberweapon might be capable of, you need to look, counter-intuitively, at North Korea. This week, the UK and USA officially blamed it for the Wannacry ransomware attack which spread rapidly around the world earlier this year. But its fearsome success was partly because it used tools developed by the US National Security Agency. Those tools were stolen, leaked publicly, then exploited by the North Koreans. The UK's cyber arsenal should at least match those capabilities, given GCHQ's expertise and funding levels."

The University of East Anglia student did not take her mobile phone with her and - other than a possible CCTV image of her heading towards the seafront - there have been no sightings or sign of where she might have gone. Volunteers have searched beaches in the area and officers from Norfolk Police have conducted house-to-house inquiries, liaised with local hospitals and checked places she was known to have links. Inspector Will Drummond said there were growing concerns for the 21-year-old's wellbeing. ""We have diligently searched for Sophie and have investigated a range of scenarios but unfortunately there have been no confirmed sightings or contact since she left her property at 3am,"" he said. ""We have a possible CCTV image of Sophie heading towards the seafront but, despite all our efforts, we have found no further trace of her. ""I would like to take this opportunity to ask the public to check their sheds and outbuildings in case Sophie has got disorientated and slept in the nearest place of shelter. ""We are in close contact with Sophie's family, who are being supported by officers at what is a very difficult time for them.

Thousands of people have shared appeals to find her on social media, with more than 15,000 having joined a ""Find Sophie Smith"" group on Facebook. In addition to leaving without her phone, the group says Sophie - who is about 5ft 8ins tall with shoulder-length blonde hair - also had no purse and no house or car keys. She had not been drinking or out with friends at the time of her disappearance and her sudden departure from the property near Great Yarmouth is said to be ""very out of character behaviour"". :: Anyone with information about Sophie's whereabouts is asked to call Norfolk Police on 101"
2017-12-28,The year 2017 has been the greenest ever in how the UK generates its electricity.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171229015502/https://news.sky.com/story/going-green-uk-sets-renewable-energy-records-11187876,"Renewable sources of energy produced more than three times the amount of electricity that came from coal. More electricity was generated by wind than coal on more than three quarters of days in the year, and more by solar energy on more than half the days. The UK broke 13 renewable energy records in 2017, including some especially notable ones. :: In March, the largest amount of renewable electricity was produced - 19.2GW. :: In April, the UK had its first 24-hour period for more than 150 years without using power from coal. :: In June, wind, nuclear and solar were generating more than gas and coal combined for the first time. :: In December, the country generated the most wind power in a day - 281.5GW. The figures have been welcomed by environmental campaigners, including Gareth Redmond-King, of the environmental campaigning group WWF. He told Sky News: ""A huge part of it is government support to install new renewables, offshore wind particularly, but also onshore wind and solar that's enabled the industry to grow - and for much more renewables on the system. ""Of course, companies have had to adjust to provide for that and build those power stations, and of course the more consumers that switch to clean energy the more demand there is for that to be built."" :: UK has greenest ever summer as low carbon energy production spikes :: Offshore wind farm subsidies at record low The figures from the National Grid reflect a UK government commitment to reduce carbon emissions and meet its targets on greenhouse gases. It has targeted 2025 as a date to end the use of ""unabated coal"" - coal from which the carbon emissions are not captured. However, while the news is good on the use of renewables versus coal, there are less encouraging figures regarding gas. This year, output from wind was more than from gas - a fossil fuel - on only two days, and overall renewables outstripped gas on just 23 days."

Six of the wounded remain in hospital. Many were shopping ahead of New Year's celebrations, the largest holiday in the country, followed by Russian Orthodox Christmas on 7 January. Officials said the unidentified explosive had power equivalent to 200 grams of TNT, and was placed in a storage locker. ""As you know, an act of terror took place in St Petersburg yesterday,"" President Putin said at a ceremony for military officers who took part in Russia's Syria campaign. He said, in light of the bombing, the Russian security services had been ordered to ""act decisively"" and ""liquidate bandits on the spot"" if armed militants attempted to resist them. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained that he was referring to all those ""who harbour plans to carry out acts of terror in our country"". Mr Peskov rejected concerns that the many thousands of Muslim migrants in St Petersburg were to be put under suspicion because of the incident. ""Terrorism presents a danger to any populated locality in the world,"" he said. The bombing follows April's suicide attack in the St Petersburg metro which was carried out by a Russian citizen born in Kyrgyzstan killed 15 people. In December, the Russian security service announced the arrests of a number of Islamic State members who had planned to destroy St Petersburg's iconic Kazan Cathedral. Mr Putin thanked US President Donald Trump for the help from the CIA in identifying the terrorists. The head of the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, said the nation was alert to potential jihadist fighters returning from Syria ahead of the World Cup. St Petersburg will host several World Cup matches, including one of the semi-final matches in 2018."
2017-12-28,Gareth Southgate was curious. We were chatting over sausage rolls and Champagne at a social event before Christmas.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171229015502/https://news.sky.com/story/2018-sports-predictions-england-will-do-themselves-justice-at-the-world-cup-under-gareth-southgate-11186959,"What, the England manager asked, had taken me to Repino in Soviet times? You won't know the place yet, probably, but you will. The one-horse town, up the coast from St Petersburg, and whose streets I had once scoured as a student for something edible, will be home to England's campaign to win the World Cup in Russia. Time spent in the thoughtful Southgate's company persuades one that England will do themselves justice at last. But expect France - laden with two teams worth of world-class talent - to lift the trophy, ahead of Brazil and Germany. Surprise package? Egypt or Sweden. If only the Premier League would be so unpredictable. Thirteen points clear at Christmas, Manchester City might as well have asked Santa to drop off the trophy on his rounds. They won't be derailed by injuries or the competing demands of the Champions League, because their squad is an Aladdin's cave of treasures (""Where's the opposition?"" ""Far behind you."") I think they will win the League Cup as well, and Liverpool can douse Jurgen Klopp's beard in champagne to toast an FA Cup win on Royal Wedding day. History says Team GB won't need much Champagne at the Winter Olympics. But times are changing, and with speed skater Elise Christie leading the way, the record haul of four medals may very well be broken. The Six Nations rugby will be under way by then. The bookies make England clear favourites. I think it's more open than that. England's match away to improving Scotland may be key. Ireland, less troubled by injuries than England or Wales, could win. Golfing trends suggest Ryder Cup momentum is with the USA (winners on home soil last time). In Paris in September I think Europe will triumph, with Justin Rose and the wonderful young Spaniard Jon Rahm to the fore. Outside bet to win a first major? Swede Alex Noren, currently world number 18. England's cricketers will find life a continued struggle in New Zealand but will bounce back on home soil in the summer. What of Britain's big individual stars? Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes might not lord it over Ferrari quite as in 2017, Anthony Joshua will keep his world title but will not look so invincible and Sir Mo Farah will find the switch to marathons less than smooth. Meanwhile in tennis, Sir Andy Murray will struggle to reach the top again after hip trouble and Jo Konta can (at least) reach another Grand Slam semi final. Only a fool would predict how Chris Froome's year will go. Hero or zero - the scientists and lawyers will decide. But let us at least hope the biggest headlines in cycling - and athletics - are about racing and not doping. If My Fair Lady was part of your Christmas viewing, wouldn't it be lovely if a few more of these wishes came true too: :: Fraternity not fighting at the World Cup:: A clean Winter Olympics:: All the horses home safe at Cheltenham and Aintree:: Quicker video referrals in rugby,:: Gay elite footballers finding it OK to come out:: More plain speaking from authority and from interviewees:: And Manchester mudslingers Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola making us laugh - or at least smile - a bit more often Oh, and football club owners being less knee-jerk about sacking managers. We can always dream."

It ended the session at 7620.7, 28 points up on its opening mark and a new closing high. The rally was supported by an upturn in copper and other commodity prices, which helped to lift global mining giants including Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Glencore. Demand for commodities implies optimism about the outlook for rapidly advancing world economies such as China. Greg McKenna, chief strategist at AxiTrader, said: ""The rally in copper supports expectations that 2018 is going to be a strong year for synchronised global growth."" Other world markets were also ahead. The FTSE 100's latest rally leaves it nearly 500 points higher than at the end of 2016. Its performance this year reflects global conditions affecting its internationally-focused businesses rather than the health of the UK economy. Sentiment has been buoyed in recent weeks by the passage of a $1.5tn tax cut plan in Washington. The index has also been helped this year by the weakness of the pound - which means the dollar and euro earnings of its global constituents are worth more when translated back into sterling."

Vlogging is now being taught to Girlguides and younger Brownies around the UK as part of a skills package which includes podcasting, movie-making and online safety. It coincides with an ongoing overhaul of Girlguides badges and activities to bring them up to date. Mairi Gordon, of Girlguiding Scotland, told Sky News: ""We change as the lives of girls change, so we're as relevant today as we were 100 years ago when we started up. ""It's all about giving girls digital skills and the chance to try something new. We're looking to embed science and technology to everyday unit meetings and show girls how much they are capable of. ""It gives them a chance to try out some new technology and make their voices heard using different mediums."" The new badges for the UK's 500,000 Girlguides are due to be unveiled in the spring 2018, and whilst ""YouTubing"" is not expected to have a badge of its own, it will feature as an element of a digital skills or computing badge. Girlguiding's stated aim is to equip and empower girls with the skills to give them confidence and according to Katie Snooks - whose online make-up tutorials and fashion reviews have attracted more than eight million views - YouTubing chimes with the mission statement. She told Sky News: ""There is a real risk for girls to feel quite intimidated and body conscious because of all the perfection that social media portrays but I think that's where YouTubing and vlogging comes in great, because we're able to show the ups and downs of life, keep it really real and relatable and i think that's important.

There will be little change elsewhere, with most places fine into the evening. Friday will be windy with rain and hill snow spreading from the southwest, followed by sunshine and showers. It will turn less cold in the South. The weekend will be milder, but there will be some heavy rain at times, bringing a risk of localised flooding."

Jessica, 28, is fighting for her life after she was pulled from the car moments before it burst into flames. The women's parents, Lars, 69, and Vivian, 60, are reported to have died instantly. Annabelle's boyfriend Jordan Brohier wrote on Facebook: ""Today I lost the love of my life Annabelle. I've never met such a kind, gentle soul and this world is at such a loss without this beautiful angel."" He added: ""My prayers are with darling Jess and I hope she can pull through."" The driver of the second vehicle - a Toyota Prado four-wheel drive - has been named as 51-year-old Craig Anthony Whitall. He is also believed to have died instantly after his car was apparently unable to make it around a sweeping bend and it veered across the lanes and into the Falkholts' path. Mr Whitall was on his way home from a visit to a methadone clinic, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Witnesses have claimed his car drifted on to the wrong side of the road on two occasions before the crash. His son Shane Whitall wrote on Facebook: ""I love you with all my heart dad and will forever miss you you were my hero I don't give a f*** what anyone says you showed me alot in my life more than youl ever know its such a tragedy to loose you I LOVE YOU DAD RIP."" Jessica played Hope Morrison in Home and Away and was set to star in a new thriller series on Australian television. Her first movie Harmony is due for release in 2018."

Both will appear by video link before Westminster Magistrates Court on Friday.

Officers were later assisted by an army bomb disposal unit in carrying out a controlled explosion at an address in Derby on 22 December. Police were originally given until Christmas Day to to decide if they wanted to charge the four men, but a 36-year-old man from Burngreave in Sheffield remains in custody. A 41-year-old from Meersbrook in Sheffield was released on 23 December. The arrests followed an investigation led by Counter Terrorism Policing North East, backed by Derbyshire Constabulary and South Yorkshire Police."

As Dr Strangelove himself puts it: ""Of course, the whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh?"" The UK has been telling the world about its deterrent cyberweapon program since at least 2011, when it first acknowledged the program. Since then, we've seen numerous and devastating hacks from nation states including Russia, Iran and North Korea. One wonders how effective that UK deterrent has been. So the UK has decided to tell the world about its cyberweapons again. Boris Johnson has told the Russians that we will retaliate against cyberattacks. And in the Intelligence and Security Committee's annual review of the intelligence agencies, published this week, GCHQ said it was developing a ""full spectrum"" of offensive capabilities. GCHQ said that ranged from ""technical stuff... right through to what we would say is the high end of counter-state offensive cybercapabilities which might never be used, and everything in between."" What might those weapons look like in real life? The Times reports techniques including ""the ability to make another country's warplanes, ships and missiles malfunction and to infect a mobile phone to suck up information or wipe the memory"". In fact, we've seen examples of exactly that - from the Russians. Hacking into phones is on the low end of what nation-states are capable of. But in June, ships in the Black Sea were sent off course because their GPS signals were spoofed. Many systems - including missiles and drones - rely on GPS (although not entirely). Or take power stations. Ukraine's power grid has been shut down by cyberattacks twice in the last two years. Officials there have blamed Russia for the sabotage. For an example of what a Western cyberweapon might be capable of, you need to look, counter-intuitively, at North Korea. This week, the UK and USA officially blamed it for the Wannacry ransomware attack which spread rapidly around the world earlier this year. But its fearsome success was partly because it used tools developed by the US National Security Agency. Those tools were stolen, leaked publicly, then exploited by the North Koreans. The UK's cyber arsenal should at least match those capabilities, given GCHQ's expertise and funding levels."

In a short message, signed off with his trademark phrase, 77-year-old Mr Starr said: ""It's great! It's an honour and a pleasure to be considered and acknowledged for my music and my charity work, both of which I love. Peace and love. Ringo."" There are also knighthoods for Bee Gees co-founder Barry Gibb, former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and War Horse author Michael Murpurgo. Strictly Come Dancing judge and former top ballerina Darcey Bussell is made a dame. Ms Bussell said: ""I am truly humbled to receive this honour. I gratefully accept it on behalf of all the dance organisations that I am so fortunate to be part of. Dance is such a beautiful art form, it is inspiring and provides joy, social cohesion and wellbeing."" Among the politicians on the list is Jo Swinson, who reclaimed her East Dunbartonshire seat for the Liberal Democrats in the last election, and became the party's deputy leader. After learning of her CBE, Ms Swinson said: ""I'm delighted that my work has been recognised in this way. It wouldn't be possible without the support of my constituents, whom I'd like to thank for giving me the opportunity to serve as their MP once more. ""It is an honour to be listed among so many remarkable people from all walks of life, making amazing contributions right across our country."" The knighthood for Ms Swinson's fellow Liberal Democrat Mr Clegg has led to anger that Brexit rival Nigel Farage failed to make the cut again. Mr Farage said getting an honour was not an ""aspiration"" for him but did criticise the awards given to backbench MPs on both sides, saying they were given for ""services to the establishment"". Tory MPs who have been awarded knighthoods include Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, 64, and Christopher Chope, 70, while Cheryl Gillan becomes a dame. On the other side of the house, Labour's Mark Hendrick, 59, and Commons deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle, 60, are knighted. The rise of grime music gets a nod, as Wiley, real name Richard Cowie, gets an MBE, as does Skepta's manager Grace Ladoja. But Skepta is rumoured to have turned down an honour last year, making reference in Hypocrisy, where he sings: ""The MBE got rejected / I'm not trying to be accepted."" Godfather of grime Wiley, 38, said: ""I'm honoured to be receiving an MBE. ""It feels like the school grade I wanted and didn't get but now I'm finally there."" Heather Knight, who captained the World Cup-winning England cricket team, is awarded an OBE, along with a head coach Mark Robinson. Clare Connor, director of England Women's cricket, has her CBE upgraded. Former Sky News presenter Eamonn Holmes receives an OBE for services to broadcasting, and said it felt like getting a ""gold star on your homework"". There are no mentions for those who helped in the Grenfell Tower fire, but a cabinet office spokesman explained these are likely to come at a later date, as consideration is given. The oldest people on the list are Lieutenant Colonel Mordaunt Cohen, who receives an MBE for services to Second World War education and Helena Jones, who will be given an BEM for services to young people and the community in Brecon, Powys. Both are 101-years-old. The youngest is Lucia Mee, aged 18, who receives a BEM for her work raising awareness of organ donation. The 2018 list is 6% smaller than the 2017 list, and the smallest since 2013. Women make up just under half of the honours list, as 551 collect an award. Black, Asian and minority ethnic background recipients account for 9.2%."

2017-12-29,"Theresa May's infrastructure tsar has quit, delivering a scathing verdict on
the Prime Minister's approach to Brexit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171230021517/https://news.sky.com/story/read-lord-adonis-letter-to-pm-in-full-as-labour-peer-quits-government-role-11188763,"Here is the text of the resignation letter sent by Lord Andrew Adonis to Mrs May: Dear Prime Minister, The hardest thing in politics is to bring about lasting change for the better, and I believe in co-operation across parties to achieve it. In this spirit I was glad to accept reappointment last year as Chair of the independent National Infrastructure Commission, when you also reaffirmed your support for HS2, which will help overcome England's north-south divide when it opens in just eight years time. I would like to thank you for your courtesy in our personal dealings. The Commission has done good work in the past 27 months, thanks to dedicated public servants and commissioners. Sir John Armitt, my deputy chair, and Phil Graham, chief executive, have been brilliant throughout. I am particularly proud of our plans for equipping the UK with world-class 4G and 5G mobile systems; for Crossrail 2 in London and HS3 to link the Northern cities; and for transformational housing growth in the Oxford-Milton Keynes-Cambridge corridor. I hope these plans are implemented without delay. However, my work at the Commission has become increasingly clouded by disagreement with the Government, and after much consideration I am writing to resign because of fundamental differences which simply cannot be bridged. The European Union Withdrawal Bill is the worst legislation of my lifetime. It arrives soon in the House of Lords and I feel duty bound to oppose it relentlessly from the Labour benches. Brexit is a populist and nationalist spasm worthy of Donald Trump. After the narrow referendum vote, a form of associate membership of the EU might have been attempted without rupturing Britain's key trading and political alliances. Instead, by allying with UKIP and the Tory hard right to wrench Britain out of the key economic and political institutions of modern Europe, you are pursuing a course fraught with danger. Even within Ireland, there are set to be barriers between people and trade. If Brexit happens, taking us back into Europe will become the mission of our children's generation, who will marvel at your acts of destruction. A responsible government would be leading the British people to stay in Europe while also tackling, with massive vigour, the social and economic problems within Britain which contributed to the Brexit vote. Unfortunately, your policy is the reverse. The Government is hurtling towards the EU's emergency exit with no credible plan for the future of British trade and European co-operation, all the while ignoring - beyond soundbites and inadequate programmes - the crises ofhousing, education, the NHS, and social and regional inequality which are undermining the fabric of our nation and feeding a populist surge. What Britain needs in 2018 is a radically reforming government in the tradition of Attlee, working tirelessly to eradicate social problems while strengthening Britain's international alliances. This is a cause I have long advocated, and acted upon in government, and I intend to pursue it with all the energy I can muster. Britain must be deeply engaged, responsible and consistent as a European power. When in times past we have isolated ourselves from the Continent in the name of 'empire' or 'sovereignty,' we were soon sucked back in. This will inevitably happen again, given our power, trade, democratic values and sheer geography. Putin and the rise of authoritarian nationalism in Poland and Hungry are flashing red lights. As Edmund Burke so wisely wrote, 'people will not look forwards to posterity who do not look backwards to their ancestors.' However, I would have been obliged to resign from the Commission at this point anyway because of the Transport Secretary's indefensible decision to bail-out the Stagecoach/Virgin East Coast rail franchise. The bailout will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds, possibly billions if other loss-making rail companies demand equal treatment. It benefits only the billionaire owners of these companies and their shareholders, while pushing rail fares still higher and threatening national infrastructure investment. It is even more inexcusable given the Brexit squeeze on public spending. The only rationale I can discern for the bailout is as a cynical political manoeuvre by Chris Grayling, a hard right Brexiteer, to avoid following my 2009 precedent when National Express defaulted on its obligations to the state for the same East Coast franchise because it too had overbid for the contract. I set up a successful public operator to take over East Coast services and banned National Express from bidding for new contracts. The same should have been done in this case. Yet, astonishingly, Stagecoach has not only been bailed out: it remains on the shortlist for the next three rail franchises. The East Coast affair will inevitably come under close scrutiny by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee, and I need to be free to set out serious public interest concerns. I hope the PAC calls Sir Richard Branson and Sir Brian Souter to give evidence. I am ready to share troubling evidence with the PAC and other parliamentary committees investigating the bailout. As you know, I raised these concerns with the Chancellor and the Transport Secretary as soon as the bailout became apparent from the small print of an odd policy statement on 29 November majoring on reversing Beeching rail closures of the 1960s. I received no response from either Minister beyond inappropriate requests to desist. Brexit is causing a nervous breakdown across Whitehall and conduct unworthy of Her Majesty's Government. I am told, by those of longer experience, that it resembles Suez and the bitter industrial strife of the 1970s, both of which endangered not only national integrity but the authority of the state itself. You occupy one of the most powerful offices in the history of the world, the heir of Churchill, Attlee and Gladstone. Whatever our differences, I wish you well in guiding our national destiny at this critical time. Yours sincerely, Andrew Adonis"

Responding to a Freedom of Information request, the BoE said 188m notes, or £940,000,000 in £5, were swapped before the day they stopped being legal tender. But a whopping 138.2m paper £5 banknotes were never exchanged at bank branches. That means there is £691m in unusable fivers sitting in old coat pockets, and hiding down the backs of sofas, across the country. Although they can't be taken in shops, they can be swapped for a new polymer £5 note. A Bank of England spokesman said: ""All genuine Bank of England notes that have been withdrawn from circulation retain their face value for all time and can still be exchanged over the counter. ""There is no fee for this service and there is no expiry on the period in which we will exchange old notes. Banknotes can also be exchanged by post."" As well as the polymer £5 and £10, a new £1 coin was released in 2017, with the old round coins being phased out into the new 12-sided coins. The Royal Mint had 1.42bn round £1 coins returned, and the process is still ongoing. The Mint was unable to provide an estimate of how many may be left, but advised people to return them or donate them to charity. A spokesman added: ""In all recoinages, a proportion of coin is not returned. ""We expect that the proportion of round £1 coins removed from circulation to be in line with previous withdrawals of high denomination coins, such as the recoinage of the 50p, which took place between 1997 and 1998."" The Royal British Legion continued to accept the round coins for the year's Poppy Appeal, encouraging people to donate them rather than swap them. The Legion's Director of Fundraising, Claire Rowcliffe, said: ""We were incredibly grateful to see so many people donating their old pound coins towards this year's Poppy Appeal. ""Counting will continue well into the New Year, but we estimate that around £1 million worth of the old coins were given. ""These funds will translate into vital support for our Armed Forces community around the country."""

Lynn Evans, chairperson of the church, said: ""We've been raising money for local charities through our Christmas crib appeal every Christmas for decades and were very sad to discover the theft, which we think took place on Christmas Eve. ""This year we are supporting Matthew's House based on Swansea High Street, a charity supporting homeless people. We are determined not to be defeated by this, and to turn this negative event into a positive."" The money had not been counted, but a JustGiving appeal to replace it has totalled more than £250. The flagstones next to the box were also damaged. The damage wasn't discovered until Friday, when a dance group arrived to use the building. The matter has been reported to police and Sky News has contacted South Wales Police for a comment."

""It's quite an advance in terms of food processing,"" Professor Chris Elliott, chair of the Institute for Global Food Security, told Sky News. Professor Elliott said: ""Nitrates have been used for a long, long time in preservation of bacon and the inventor of Naked Bacon has come up with a completely different approach."" Finnebrogue claims its Naked Bacon product is completely free of nitrites, preservatives, E numbers and all allergens. In 2015, the World Health Organisation concluded that processed meat, including bacon, was carcinogenic - possibly because nitrites can form carcinogenic compounds in the human body called nitrosamines. Finnebrogue said that alongside a Spanish chemist it developed a new flavouring from fruit and spice extracts which looks and tastes like traditional bacon and has a similar shelf life. Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn said: ""Bacon contains nitrites, nitrites produce nitrosamines in your gut and nitrosamines are carcinogenic. Nitrites should not be in food. ""I've been all over the world to figure out a way to make bacon without nitrites - and up to now we'd never made a single rasher of bacon because we couldn't work out how to do it. ""For more than a decade I have insisted we not touch bacon until such time as we can make it better and safer - and now we have. ""Our Naked Bacon is not only safer than any other bacon on the market, it also tops the charts in blind taste tests. This really is the biggest revolution to the British breakfast for a generation."" Neil Parish, Conservative MP and chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural AffairsCommittee, said: ""Making bacon without nitrites - and reducing the risk in the famous full English breakfast - is a remarkable feat of food technology and a brilliant British success story. ""This is further evidence that the British food industry is going from strength to strength. UK firms like Finnebrogue are leading the way in producing some of the best food anywhere in the world."" Naked Bacon will launch in Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Tesco from 10 January."

Officers found his body at a recycling plant in Houghton, County Durham, and believe he climbed into a bin after the night out a few miles away. According to the Sunday league he played in, he'd contacted his fiancee around 10.55pm on 22 December, and been seen online around 2.10am on 23 December. A Northumbria Police spokesman said: ""The last confirmed sighting of Jay is at 4.15am on Saturday December 23 outside Arizona and Purple bar. ""From here, he is understood to have been taken to the recycling plant after entering a bin that was later collected in the early hours of Saturday. ""Jay's family are being supported by specialist officers and wish to send a message to drinkers and party-goers to stay safe on a night out, particularly as New Year's Eve approaches. ""They're urging people to stay together and keep an eye out for friends."" Mr McLaren was said to be a keen footballer. He was engaged, and the father of a two-year-old girl. Police are not looking for suspects but have appealed for information. In a tribute on Facebook, Nathan Hudson wrote: ""Totally devastated about this.... he was the nicest lad"". Paul Wilkinson added: ""Immense midfielder like. Nice lad too."" The Sunderland Sunday League posted: ""We are absolutely devastated to announce the passing of Jay McLaren. All our thoughts are with Jay's fiancé, daughter, family and friends at this extremely sad time. RIP Jay - you will never be forgotten. ""We will be donating all Total Sport Challenge Cup entry fees and all money raised at all of this seasons cup finals to Jay McLaren's fiancé & family."" At the beginning of December, Mr McLaren had shared images of his daughter on Facebook, and said she had helped him realise his purpose in life. The case bears a resemblance to that of missing RAF gunner Corrie McKeague. Extensive searches of a landfill site have not brought any evidence of his whereabouts after he went missing in September 2016."

Mr Putin described the attack as an ""act of terror"", adding that security services had been ordered to ""act decisively"" and ""liquidate bandits on the spot"" if armed militants attempted to resist them. The bombing follows April's suicide attack in the St Petersburg metro which killed 15 people. It was carried out by a Russian citizen born in Kyrgyzstan. Earlier this month, Russia announced the arrests of a number of Islamic State members who it said had planned to attack St Petersburg's Kazan Cathedral. Mr Putin thanked President Trump for help from the CIA in identifying the suspects. Russia is hosting the 2018 World Cup, and St Petersburg is staging several matches, including one of the semi-finals. Head of the FSB security service, Alexander Bortnikov, said the nation was alert to the possibility of jihadist fighters returning from Syria ahead of the tournament. He said at least 4,500 Russians had left to fight with ""terrorists"" in the Middle East, North Africa and elsewhere."
2017-12-29,The UK is set to have its coldest night of the year as Arctic air causes the mercury to plummet on Thursday night.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171230021517/https://news.sky.com/story/britain-set-for-coldest-night-of-the-year-as-heavy-snow-expected-11187440,"Temperatures below minus 13C (8.6F) are expected in parts of Scotland and heavy snow is predicted to fall on Friday in the east Midlands, North West and Yorkshire. The Met Office predicts accumulations of up to 10cm (4ins) are likely and up to 15cm (6ins) could fall over higher ground. ""Travel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers. Some delays and cancellations to rail and air travel are likely,"" the Met Office warned. ""There is a possibility that some rural communities could become temporarily cut off. Power cuts may also occur."" A yellow warning for snow has also been issued for southern and eastern Scotland, northern England and the Midlands. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: ""The coldest temperature we have seen this year is minus 13C in Scotland, and we are likely to see temperatures slightly below that,"" she added. ""But we are not talking about those extremes in the town and city centres, it is out in rural areas, more exposed areas, particularly over lying snow where you see temperatures drop the most."" On Wednesday, cancellations and delays caused by bad weather caused chaos at various travel terminals. Stansted temporarily closed its runway twice due to ice, resulting in 27 inbound and 27 outbound flights being cancelled. Around 50 flights were also cancelled at Luton. Roughly 300 passengers were left in the terminal at Stansted waiting to rebook flights on Wednesday evening after dozens of Ryanair services were cancelled, along with a number of easyJet flights. Lana Briggs, who had flown into Stansted from Dublin, told Sky News her aircraft was held on the runway for an hour and she was not told when her luggage would be unloaded. She said: ""People are talking about it turning into a riot if we don't get more information. I'm sure it's not going to happen but it does feel pretty devastating at the moment. It's definitely tense."" Heavy snow also caused disruption on the roads. The RAC said it saw a 15-20% spike in call-outs on Wednesday compared with the same time last year. An AA spokesman said it had dealt with 8,000 breakdowns by lunchtime, which was ""significantly more than a normal Wednesday in winter"". The latest cold snap comes around a fortnight after hundreds of schools were closed, homes were left without power, and travellers were stranded or forced to stay indoors when a deep freeze gripped the UK."

Police have been searching the Norfolk coast and sea in the hopes of finding the University of East Anglia student. They say that Sophie, who has been experiencing severe anxiety and depression, did not have her phone with her and has not accessed her bank or social media accounts since she vanished. Inspector Will Drummond said: ""Our inquiries have revealed there's been a degree of pre-planning to her disappearance and this, combined with her mental state and comments made the previous day, suggest the most likely scenario is that she has gone into the sea."" He went on to say that expert analysis of the tide is being carried out. Sophie has not been captured on any other CCTV cameras. Inspector Drummond said: ""This is clearly a very distressing time for her family and we continue to keep them updated of ongoing work in this case.""

The judge granted a decree nisi, and either the husband or wife will be able to apply for a decree absolute, finally formalising the divorce, six weeks after it is granted. Louise, now 43, was a finalist in the 2016 edition of Strictly Come Dancing while Jamie is a football pundit. They married in 1998 aboard a luxury yacht in Bermuda, and went on to have two sons who are now nine and 13. Ms Redknapp, who went by the name Louise for much of her pop career, was a member of R&B girl group Eternal and achieved solo success with tracks including Naked. She told the Daily Telegraph that participating in Strictly has given her a new lease of life after what she said was an experience of ""a sort of Stepford Wife"".

The Europhile Labour peer and infrastructure tsar said he was duty bound to oppose the EU (Withdrawal) Bill when it comes to the House of Lords. In a resignation letter seen by Sky News, Lord Adonis said: ""Brexit is a dangerous populist and nationalist spasm worthy of Donald Trump. ""After the narrow referendum vote, a form of associate membership of the EU might have been attempted without rupturing Britain's key trading and political alliances. ""Instead, by allying with UKIP and the Tory hard right to wrench Britain out of the key economic and political institutions of modern Europe, you are pursuing a course fraught with danger."" :: Read Lord Adonis' letter to PM in full as Labour peer quits Government role He added: ""Brexit is causing a nervous breakdown across Whitehall and conduct unworthy of Her Majesty's Government."" Lord Adonis claimed he would also have felt the need to resign after the ""bailout"" of the Stagecoach and Virgin East Coast franchise, suggesting it will cost the taxpayer ""hundreds of millions of pounds"", which he called ""more inexcusable given the Brexit squeeze on public spending"". He suggested the bailout was a ""cynical political manoeuvre"" by his successor Chris Grayling to avoid following his 2009 precedent, which allowed National Express to default, and placed the line into public hands. National Express was also banned from bidding for new contracts after his move. Mr Grayling announced a new East Coast partnership for intercity train and track operations in 2020. The partnership had previously agreed to pay £3.3bn to run the service until 2023. Lord Adonis later tweeted, saying: ""I meant what I said in my resignation letter about the PM's courtesy. Which makes it sad that 'No 10 sources' up to dirty tricks."" He also added that a newspaper article this weekend would make it clear why he had to resign. Lord Adonis was reappointed to his role in April, and avoided being sacked in July, even though he compared Brexit to ""Nazi appeasement"". The Commission is a Government-backed body that gives impartial advice to major long-term infrastructure challenges. A Government source said the peer, whose frequent criticism of Brexit had caused outrage among Conservative Eurosceptics, had ""walked through the door before he was pushed"". Brexiteer Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith told Sky News: ""Lord Adonis' departure is long overdue. ""It's a bit rich for him to pontificate on what he calls populism, but what most would refer to as democracy, when he himself has never been elected by a public vote. He has instead relied on preferment from others."" Fellow Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg told Sky News: ""It is characteristic of the Blairite dismissiveness of the electorate. Not dangerous, populist and nationalist but arrogant, out of touch and elitist."" Responding, Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said: ""Lord Adonis is one of the most thoughtful politicians around. This is why he has so many friends and political admirers beyond the Labour Party. ""It is, then, a great shame that he is no longer leading Britain's infrastructure programme. Yet he felt there was no other option but to resign because of the way Brexit has been so badly mishandled. ""Notably, he is deeply concerned by how the Conservative leadership has pandered to its right wing over the single market and customs union, leaving which will badly - and needlessly - damage our trade. ""We hope to work closely with Andrew - and Lord Heseltine, another admirable politician who has been so badly treated by the Conservative right - in fighting to end the hard Brexit that the government is recklessly pursuing."""

The 16-year-old, who had been working as a prostitute in the city's red light district, was last seen alive in Rouen Road at 1.15am on the same day. A post-mortem examination concluded she died of asphyxiation. Cold case detectives received 45 calls after issuing a new appeal last month. The information included two sightings of Natalie which have since been dismissed as mistaken. ""We are in the process of taking DNA samples from all men which will be run against DNA that was recovered from the crime scene,"" a spokeswoman from Norfolk Police said. That DNA profile was loaded onto the national DNA database. While more than 4,000 people have been interviewed, with a ""large number"" providing samples for DNA testing, a match from the crime scene has never been found. ""Natalie's murder is one of those cases that could be easily solved with one piece of information,"" Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Millar has previously said."
2017-12-29,"Twenty years after Paul McCartney was knighted, and 17 years after George Harrison turned down an OBE, Beatles drummer Ringo Starr has been awarded a knighthood for services to music and charity work.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171230021517/https://news.sky.com/story/opinion-ringo-starrs-knighthood-is-long-overdue-11188896,"It will be the first time the musician has been to Buckingham Palace since the band received MBEs back in 1965. Music journalist and Beatles fan Andy Welch looks back on the 77-year-old's legacy. Arise Sir Ringo. And not a moment too soon. In fact, the knighthood of the Beatles drummer is hugely overdue. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were, of course, the driving force behind the band, widely regarded as the greatest of British exports, with notable songwriting additions from George Harrison. As a result, McCartney was knighted in 1997, quite rightly the first popular music icon to be awarded the honour for services to British music, years ahead of Mick Jagger, Cliff Richard and the rest. It's perhaps safe to assume the honour would have at least been offered to Lennon too had he not died in 1980. Whether he'd have accepted - he returned his MBE, awarded in 1965 alongside the rest of The Beatles - is another matter. The same could be said for Harrison, who sadly died in 2001. Ringo should not have had to wait anywhere near so long, not when the honours are handed to sports stars, actors and politicians whose achievements and impact on the world pales in comparison with his. As one of two remaining Beatles, he can't help but be in the shadow of the creative colossus that is Paul McCartney. But Ringo was a quarter of the greatest cultural force the world has ever seen. And a brilliant part of it at that. ""John Lennon said he wasn't even the best drummer in The Beatles."" Quiet at the back. Lennon never said anything of the sort, that joke was made by one-time TV staple Jasper Carrott in about 1983. It's attitudes like that wrongly attributed 'joke' that have, I believe, held back Ringo's right and proper treatment. It's all part of the same pernicious, lazy perceived wisdom among pub bores and casual fans around the country that Ringo was some sort of talent-less journeyman, in the right place at the right time. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was nowhere to hide in that band. The next time you listen to a Beatles track, listen closely to the drums. Ringo's drumming, so fluid, so intuitive, is unlike virtually every other rock and roll drummer before or since. It couldn't be anyone else on the drum stool. He played the song, rather than merely adding a beat. His drumming has feel, he could swing like no other. Imagine, if you can, Beatles songs without his playing. It's impossible. After The Beatles was his solo work. Of course, it never hit the heights of his three bandmates. There are, however, diamonds in the rough - check out It Don't Come Easy and Photograph, if you need persuading. His tours with his All Starr Band are hugely successful. There's also his underrated acting career, Thomas the Tank Engine narration, and philanthropy - one auction of his belongings in 2015 raised more than $9m (£6m) for his and wife Barbara Bach's Lotus Foundation. Not bad for a boy from Liverpool. So arise Sir Ringo, better late than never."

Intoxication currently accounts for 12-15% of all A&E attendance in England, the NHS believes, and on weekend nights during the festive period the number could rise to 70%, NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said ""NHS doesn't stand for 'National Hangover Service'"", and criticised ""selfish"" partygoers. ""When the health service is pulling out all the stops to care for sick and vulnerable patients who rightly and genuinely need our support, it's frankly selfish when ambulance paramedics and A&E nurses have to be diverted to looking after revellers who have overindulged and who just need somewhere to safely sleep it off,"" he said. ""In the run-up to Christmas, having been out with ambulance crews on night shifts in London and the West Midlands, I've seen first-hand how paramedics and A&Es are being called on to deal with drunk and often aggressive people."" Newcastle, Bristol and Cardiff already use the facilities, where drinkers are able to sleep off their overindulgence after being checked on by health professionals. In Cardiff, the Alcohol Treatment Centre in the city centre is staffed by nurses, a paramedic and a police officer, with leadership from a senior A&E nurse. In Newcastle the ambulance services and police run a ""safe haven"" service on Friday and Saturday nights over the Christmas period, attending to alcohol related incidents with a rapid response vehicle. The National Institute for Health Research is currently carrying out a study into the ways that Alcohol Intoxication Management Services can be rolled out to help patients who are drinking too much. The idea, however, does not have universal support. ""International experience on drunk tanks is that the acute setting, maybe the monitoring, isn't as long enough as we need,"" emergency services doctor Kishan Rees told Sky News. ""What we can't have is a culture where we just chuck people into a drunk tank sober them up and let them go back into society and have the same problems and things."""

About 75% of the landscape has been mapped over the last two decades, but there is only sporadic coverage of upland areas. It is hoped the new project, which will begin before the end of winter, will fill in the gaps. The quality of the image will be substantially improved too, with the scanners able to map the country at a one-metre resolution to reveal the terrain more clearly. Once complete, the data will not only be used to understand the risk of flooding and help make defence plans, but also to catch people who illegally dump huge amounts of rubbish. In 2014, the technology - which measures the distance between the plane and the ground to build a picture of the land - helped prosecute eight people in Cornwall after data revealed a sudden change in the terrain, which proved to be thousands of tons of dumped waste. Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the government agency, said: ""This ambitious project will enhance our understanding of England's unique natural features and landscape, helping us to better understand flood risk, plan effective defences and fight waste crime. ""I'm pleased we are able to gather, use and share such valuable data to contribute to environmental improvements and conservation. It's just one of the many ways the Environment Agency is using technology to help people and wildlife."" The data gathered will be freely available to the public and used by other government agencies and industries, including archaeologists hoping to uncover lost Roman roads in the North and even game developers building virtual environments for players to explore. Eleven terabytes of data is already available online, attracting more than 500,000 downloads."

It comes on the heels of a blistering attack on the Prime Minister over her ""destructive"" Brexit policy. The former Labour transport secretary, who quit as chairman of Mrs May's National Infrastructure Commission on Friday evening, told Sky News he believed it would ""become very difficult"" for Mr Grayling to keep his job once details of the deal came to light. ""We are in this crisis over the East Coast franchise where hundreds of millions of pounds is essentially being gifted to private companies by letting them off their contracts early. I have been pointing this out, the Government would far rather I wasn't pointing this out."" The Government was forced to deny claims it was bailing out private companies earlier this month after ministers said it would be intervening on the franchise and terminating the contract three years early. The franchise is operated by Stagecoach and Sir Richard Branson's Virgin. Lord Adonis said the decision to give ""two of the richest companies in the country a big hand out"" by letting them walk away from the franchise in 2020 instead of 2023 ""reflects extremely badly"" on the Government. He said the taxpayer could end up picking up a bill of hundreds of millions of pounds because of Mr Grayling's decision. ""The two private operators are being let off the contract which they had freely entered into,"" he said. ""This is the £2bn worth of payments they were due to make between 2020 and 2023 which the Government has cancelled. ""Now I know Sir Richard Branson and Sir Brain Souter, who run these private companies - they are great businessmen. They are quite right to be fighting for their shareholders but the job of the secretary of state is to stand up for the public interest and I don't believe that Chris Grayling has done that and that's why I think his position is going to become very difficult. ""I will be giving evidence to the public accounts committee [which scrutinises government spending] on what I believe has been a really serious mishandling of the East Coast rail franchise."" :: Lord Adonis says Theresa May is 'allying with UKIP' on Brexit as he quits Government role The public accounts meeting said earlier this month it would look at the deal but has yet to set up a formal inquiry. The Government has pledged to establish a new partnership between track and train operators for the East Coast franchise after its decision to terminate the contract three years early. The joint venture - 90% owned by Stagecoach and 10% owned by Virgin - has run the service since it was re-privatised in 2015 after six years in public hands. The Government has insisted the early release from the contract is not a bailout, despite Stagecoach's shares rising 13% on the news. Stagecoach has admitted overbidding for the franchise. :: Read Lord Adonis' letter to PM in full as Labour peer quits as Govt's infrastructure tsar Lord Adonis told Sky News he expected Stagecoach and Virgin to bid ""a lot, lot less"" for the new post-2020 franchise than what they offered when they expected higher traffic projections. He said the ""difference between the £2bn they were going to make and whatever sum they generously agree to make for this public private partnership will be the scale of the bailout"" by the taxpayer. ""I would be astonished if it was not hundreds of millions of pounds,"" he added. Government sources said it was ""unacceptable"" for Lord Adonis to ""use his position to make statements that could mislead the public on other aspects of transport policy"". ""No one is getting a bailout and Virgin Stagecoach will continue to meet its financial commitments made on the East Coast rail franchise to the tax payer as it has done since 2015."""

And a brilliant part of it at that. ""John Lennon said he wasn't even the best drummer in The Beatles."" Quiet at the back. Lennon never said anything of the sort, that joke was made by one-time TV staple Jasper Carrott in about 1983. It's attitudes like that wrongly attributed 'joke' that have, I believe, held back Ringo's right and proper treatment. It's all part of the same pernicious, lazy perceived wisdom among pub bores and casual fans around the country that Ringo was some sort of talent-less journeyman, in the right place at the right time. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was nowhere to hide in that band. The next time you listen to a Beatles track, listen closely to the drums. Ringo's drumming, so fluid, so intuitive, is unlike virtually every other rock and roll drummer before or since. It couldn't be anyone else on the drum stool. He played the song, rather than merely adding a beat. His drumming has feel, he could swing like no other. Imagine, if you can, Beatles songs without his playing. It's impossible. After The Beatles was his solo work. Of course, it never hit the heights of his three bandmates. There are, however, diamonds in the rough - check out It Don't Come Easy and Photograph, if you need persuading. His tours with his All Starr Band are hugely successful. There's also his underrated acting career, Thomas the Tank Engine narration, and philanthropy - one auction of his belongings in 2015 raised more than $9m (£6m) for his and wife Barbara Bach's Lotus Foundation. Not bad for a boy from Liverpool. So arise Sir Ringo, better late than never."
2017-12-30,"Donald Trump has warned Iran that the ""world is watching"" after three days of anti-government protests in the country.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171231024100/https://news.sky.com/story/trump-warns-iran-world-is-watching-after-anti-government-protests-11189106,"The US President's latest intervention, via Twitter, was released as news agencies reported that two protesters had apparently been shot dead by security forces in the western Iranian town of Dorud. There was no independent verification of video, said to show the bodies, that was circulating on social media. Disruption to the internet and mobile phone services was also reported in some areas. President Trump released a series of tweets on Saturday as the protests became more widespread. On Saturday evening, he said: ""The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most."" ""Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching!"" The protests began when hundreds of people took to the streets in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city and one of the holiest places in Shia Islam, on Thursday. They spread to Tehran and other cities on Friday, with police using water cannon in some cases to disperse the crowds. Initially aimed against high prices, the anti-government protests quickly turned against the Islamic regime as a whole. Police arrested 52 people. On Saturday, tens of thousands of government supporters marched in cities across Iran in a show of support for the regime. Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption & its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests Many of the marchers carried banners backing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Small anti-government protests were continuing around the University of Tehran - where tear gas appeared to have been fired. Mr Trump tweeted earlier on Saturday: ""Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime's corruption and its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism abroad. ""Iranian govt should respect their people's rights, including right to express themselves. The world is watching!"" The US State Department condemned the arrest of peaceful protesters and urged ""all nations to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption"". Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, dismissed the comments coming from Washington, saying that ""Iranian people give no credit to the deceitful and opportunist remarks of US officials or Mr Trump."" The US President has refused to re-certify a 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers that curbed Iran's disputed nuclear programme in return for a lifting of most international sanctions. The deal was one of the biggest achievements by President Hassan Rouhani, but has yet to bring the broad economic benefits. State television said pro-government rallies were scheduled to be held in more than 1,200 cities and towns on Saturday The government-sanctioned rallies have been held annually to mark the end of protests surrounding Iran's disputed 2009 presidential election. Protesters at the time said the vote, which marked Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election as president, was rigged, and tens of thousands of people staged street protests for eight months."

The culprit is understood to kill the animals with a blunt force, before mutilating and displaying them. The grim display has led animal charity South Norwood Animal Rescue Liberty (SNARL) to theorise that the killer could hang around and gain gratification from people's reactions to finding the bodies. SNARL co-founder Tony Jenkins said: ""I think the motive is to horrify humans. ""Why else would you get a fox and cut its head completely off and then place the body pointing to the children's playground not 10 metres away. ""It is definitely an attack on humans, to terrify humans."" He also believes that identical injuries and a ""signature"" left at the scene mean that, if there is more than one killer, it is a joint enterprise rather than copycat attacks.

The latest animal deaths to be investigated by police are cats found in Wallington and Carshalton on Christmas Day, which are ""possibly linked"" to the killer. Scotland Yard has been running Operation Takahe for two years, working closely with the RSPCA and SNARL. The established link between serial killers and harming animals has led police to warn that the attacker could move on to harming vulnerable women and girls. While police previously released a description of a potential suspect, no arrests have been made. There is a £10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the killer, or killers."

I could see the blood pouring down my arm but was determined we had to keep on the scent and catch him. ""It was a good result in the end with two in custody - and we also recovered a stolen car that we believe the offenders arrived in.

""Gil indicated their target had clambered over an 8ft-high spiked fence,"" he said. ""But as Dan lifted the dog over and jumped down, his jacket snagged and sent a spike tearing into his bicep. ""Despite the wound and with blood pouring down his arm, Dan continued tracking with Gil and, shortly after, found a 22-year-old man hiding in bushes."" The pursuit came after officers detained a 16-year-old boy in Walmley in Sutton Coldfield. Both were arrested on suspicion of attempted vehicle theft. PC Thomas, who has been with the force for 16 years, said: ""I was tracking alone with Gil but the officers quickly found me and applied a tourniquet to prevent further blood loss. ""And I also want to thank the paramedics and doctors at the hospital for all their brilliant work. ""They said I was lucky and that with such a serious wound I could have suffered a very serious arterial bleed."" West Midlands Police has since dubbed the dog ""Gil the Great"" on Twitter."

""After the initial plant you can switch them on and off from anywhere in the world and listen to the room,"" explains Matt Horan, security director at C31A Solutions. ""Whereas 10, 15 years ago you would have had to go in, plant a device and then recover that device."" Tech has been getting smaller and smarter over the years - and the same goes for surveillance equipment. Mr Horan's job is to hunt them out. He shows me a few historical examples: a thick textbook containing an analogue listening device and a radio transmitter. ""Anyone trying to receive this would have to be in a very close area, maybe in a car parked outside,"" he says. Or there's a very plausible looking fire alarm, with 150 hours of recording time. ""A cleaner could come in and swap that out for a working device,"" Mr Horan says. ""Only problem with that is you have to go back into the environment."" An air freshener looks particularly convincing, until you prise the back to reveal the surveillance equipment inside. Horan says the bug-hunting business is booming. In 2017, bookings for sweeping services were double those of 2016, in homes, yachts, planes and boardrooms. The motivation of clients? ""Intellectual property theft, matrimonial issues, business acquisitions, anything like that where people want to get the upper hand on the opposition,"" says Mr Horan. ""Nine times out of 10 you don't find anything. However, there are occasions when you do find stuff."" Bug-sweeping itself is a painstaking process, as he demonstrates: ""Fundamentally, the process we do is old school because you still have to crawl around and find bugs."" First, Mr Horan and his team use an antenna to capture all the radio frequencies in the room. ""You've got phone signals, Wi-Fi, other wireless devices,"" his colleague James Moos explains, sitting at a laptop. ""But up here you might find other items you wouldn't be expecting."" Once you spot an anomaly, you've got to find it. That involves running a metal detector-like device over every inch of surface - you're looking for something that's both metal and giving off a radio frequency. And once you've found it? Well, you could leave the bug in to spread misinformation to whoever's snooping on you. Or there's the more direct approach, Horan says: ""Smash a hole in the wall and take it out."""

However, the children's charity found that just 55% of parents surveyed will monitor who they communicate with. Plenty of child-friendly tech was expected to be in high demand in the run-up to Christmas, with new iPhone models from Apple and a new Xbox from Microsoft among the gadgets released just weeks before the festive season. More than half of the devices bought - ranging from tablets to teddy bears - were bought for children aged 10 and under, but only 60% of parents plan on activating the maximum privacy settings designed to keep them safe. For the charity's chief executive Javed Khan, the results of the survey are of huge concern. ""At Barnardo's we understand how vital the online world is to children, but also how the risks can damage their childhood,"" he said. ""Internet-connected devices like tablets and iPhones can also come in the guise of harmless dolls or teddy bears and potentially allow strangers to pinpoint your address, obtain your child's name and birthday, download their photograph and even listen in on your conversations. ""We're not saying don't buy or allow your children to enjoy these toys or devices, but we are urging parents and relatives to ensure their children are as safe as possible buy ensuring privacy settings are at maximum and that they monitor who their children are communicating with."" The plea comes after a similar warning was issued by consumer group Which? in November, with the product testing organisation having found a number of ""concerning vulnerabilities"" in ""smart"" toys tipped to be big sellers at Christmas. Which? found that the likes of the Furby Connect and Toy-Fi Teddy were equipped with unsecured connections, meaning they can be accessed without a password, PIN code or any other authentication. Anyone within 10m to 30m (33ft to 100ft) of Hasbro's Furby Connect can connect via Bluetooth when it is switched on, with no physical interaction required and no security measures obstructing the pairing process. Barnardo's has urged parents to be cautious of devices that use Bluetooth, have speakers, microphones or cameras, and use GPS technology or request personal information during the set-up process."

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said it was ""impossible to negotiate"" a resolution because the Government's position has caused ""chaos and confusion"" in the rail industry. Mr Cash added: ""It's the continuing failure of the train companies and their political puppet masters in government to make any attempt whatsoever to resolve the range of separate disputes over rail safety that has led us to call this further action on SWR, and the responsibility for the disruption that will be caused lays fairly and squarely at their door. ""It really should be straight forward - the Scottish and Welsh governments have agreed to keep the guards on our trains so there is no reason why the UK government and the UK-based operators cannot do the same."" SWR say there are contingency plans in place to run approximately three-quarters of its normal service on New Year's Eve. Managing director Andy Mellors said the operator was committed to keeping guards on board all of its trains, but said talks with RMT were needed to clarify what would happen if a guard became unavailable at short notice. ""The RMT executive knows we plan to keep a guard on all our trains to assist passengers,"" he said. ""What we want to discuss with them is what happens when a guard is unavailable at short notice so that our passengers aren't left stranded. ""We have given them repeated reassurances that we will need more guards as we introduce new and longer trains. ""All our passengers want to do is to travel to be with their friends and loved ones for the New Year celebrations."" CrossCountry will also be hit by a New Year's Eve walkout over rosters and Sunday working hours, despite three days of talks before Christmas. A company spokesman urged RMT to call off the strike and take up an offer of a 48% increase to employees' Sunday overtime rate, but Mr Cash has accused the operator of ""ineptitude and arrogance"". More RMT strikes are expected in January, focusing on the train guards issue, with SWR, Southern, Merseyrail, Greater Anglia and Arriva Rail North all set to be affected. Rail minister Paul Maynard slammed the latest round of strike action as ""disgraceful"" and accused RMT of ""seeking to cause misery to paying customers trying to get home to family and friends for the New Year"". The disruption comes as the Government faces increased scrutiny over the ownership of Britain's rail operators, with a new investigation finding that 57% of passenger journeys in the 12 months to September were on foreign-owned services - mainly German and Dutch. London Overground is the country's busiest rail company fully or partly owned overseas with 189 million journeys. It is part of Arriva, which is a subsidiary of German state-owned Deutsche Bahn. Northern is owned by the same firm, SWR is owned by Hong Kong company MTR, West Midlands Railway has its ownership based in the Netherlands and Japan, and Italian state operator Trenitalia runs the c2c franchise."

A @WhichTravel investigation reveals that travellers could be getting duped by misleading holiday deals. https://t.co/bCycRf8J2L A study carried out by Which? Travel found that several popular holiday companies could be breaking the law by seducing customers with misleading time-limited deals. After tracking 30 deals, the watchdog found that over half were the same price or cheaper after the offer ended. Among the deals noted, a one-week Virgin Holiday to Florida became £115 cheaper after the deal ended. An all-inclusive seven-day Sandals break to Jamaica dropped in price by £50 the day after the sale ended. And discounted trips to Capri and Milan with travel company Inghams were still available one month after the promotional offer came to a close. Responding to the report, Sandals said they don't create false time limitations and promote their packages to customers fairly. Virgin Holidays said they do not intentionally mislead customers. ""We're always looking to secure the best possible value for our customers, and should we be able to obtain better offers from our suppliers, these savings will be passed on to benefit the customer,"" the company said. And Inghams say they are now ""reviewing all procedures"" in light of the study. Which? Travel editor Rory Boland advised holidaymakers: ""Don't be fooled - compare prices with other holiday companies and travel agents to check savings are genuine."" Which? are now sharing their findings with the Advertising Standards Authority and Trading Standards. The Association of British Travel Agents said that ""the Which? findings relate to a small number of instances and we do not believe they are reflective of wider travel industry practice"".

A yellow warning for wind has been put in place from 12am until 3pm on Sunday, in the two regions. The Met Office said: ""There is a small chance of damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs, with the potential for injuries and danger to life from flying debris."" Forecasters added that large waves and beach material could be thrown onto coastal areas, which could present a hazard. Power cuts and mobile phone signal coverage problems could also occur.

The first street trials have already been successfully completed by UK Autodrive, who worked with JLR, Tata and Ford to test vehicles on public roads in Coventry in the autumn. In spring 2018 a fleet of up to 40 driverless pods will take to the walkways of Milton Keynes to enable passengers to complete the ""last mile"" of their journeys in the town. A pool of volunteers will soon be selected to take part in the trials. However, there is an enormous challenge to overcome all the legal hurdles, insurance questions and physically changing the street furniture to accommodate the new technology in Milton Keynes, let alone other UK towns and cities. Sky News was given access to some of the final testing of the Milton Keynes autonomous pods at the purpose-built research arena in Coventry run by manufacturer Aurrigo. Engineering manager Nick Ridler described the deployment in the spring - the biggest autonomous vehicle project ever attempted in the UK - as a ""huge step"". He told Sky News: ""The year coming is the year of autonomy, it is going to hit the streets and people are going to aware of what we can offer and how we can improve lives."" Guide Dogs for the Blind is one of many organisations working with the development of the vehicles to try to ensure manufacturers think of every road user and every possible scenario. Aurrigo chief executive Dave Keene acknowledges that the public still needs to be convinced about driverless vehicles but is confident the technology will ultimately reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Britain's roads. ""The guarantee is that we are spending hundreds and hundreds of man years of testing, we are doing thousands and thousands of tests every minute to prove categorically that these vehicles are safe,"" he said. The ""last mile"" concept is, he believes, an achievable short-term goal. Mr Keene said: ""We have all had experience where we get to a train station and we say to a taxi driver, who may have queued for 30 minutes outside the station, I want to go to a location and he knows that is only 600m or a kilometre away - he doesn't want to take you on that last mile and come back and queue up. ""That is the area where we are going to take over."" A recent report forecast that the connected and automated vehicle technology sector could be worth up to £28bn to the UK economy by 2035. The outcome of the 2018 pod project in Milton Keynes and other research ongoing around the UK will help determine whether those predictions are realistic."

In a short message, signed off with his trademark phrase, 77-year-old Mr Starr said: ""It's great! It's an honour and a pleasure to be considered and acknowledged for my music and my charity work, both of which I love. Peace and love. Ringo."" There are also knighthoods for Bee Gees co-founder Barry Gibb, former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and War Horse author Michael Murpurgo. Strictly Come Dancing judge and former top ballerina Darcey Bussell is made a dame. Ms Bussell said: ""I am truly humbled to receive this honour. I gratefully accept it on behalf of all the dance organisations that I am so fortunate to be part of. Dance is such a beautiful art form, it is inspiring and provides joy, social cohesion and wellbeing."" Among the politicians on the list is Jo Swinson, who reclaimed her East Dunbartonshire seat for the Liberal Democrats in the last election, and became the party's deputy leader. After learning of her CBE, Ms Swinson said: ""I'm delighted that my work has been recognised in this way. It wouldn't be possible without the support of my constituents, whom I'd like to thank for giving me the opportunity to serve as their MP once more. ""It is an honour to be listed among so many remarkable people from all walks of life, making amazing contributions right across our country."" The knighthood for Ms Swinson's fellow Liberal Democrat Mr Clegg has led to anger that Brexit rival Nigel Farage failed to make the cut again. Mr Farage said getting an honour was not an ""aspiration"" for him but did criticise the awards given to backbench MPs on both sides, saying they were given for ""services to the establishment"". Tory MPs who have been awarded knighthoods include Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, 64, and Christopher Chope, 70, while Cheryl Gillan becomes a dame. On the other side of the house, Labour's Mark Hendrick, 59, and Commons deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle, 60, are knighted. The rise of grime music gets a nod, as Wiley, real name Richard Cowie, gets an MBE, as does Skepta's manager Grace Ladoja. But Skepta is rumoured to have turned down an honour last year, making reference in Hypocrisy, where he sings: ""The MBE got rejected / I'm not trying to be accepted."" Godfather of grime Wiley, 38, said: ""I'm honoured to be receiving an MBE. ""It feels like the school grade I wanted and didn't get but now I'm finally there."" Heather Knight, who captained the World Cup-winning England cricket team, is awarded an OBE, along with a head coach Mark Robinson. Clare Connor, director of England Women's cricket, has her CBE upgraded. Former Sky News presenter Eamonn Holmes receives an OBE for services to broadcasting, and said it felt like getting a ""gold star on your homework"". There are no mentions for those who helped in the Grenfell Tower fire, but a cabinet office spokesman explained these are likely to come at a later date, as consideration is given. The oldest people on the list are Lieutenant Colonel Mordaunt Cohen, who receives an MBE for services to Second World War education and Helena Jones, who will be given an BEM for services to young people and the community in Brecon, Powys. Both are 101-years-old. The youngest is Lucia Mee, aged 18, who receives a BEM for her work raising awareness of organ donation. The 2018 list is 6% smaller than the 2017 list, and the smallest since 2013. Women make up just under half of the honours list, as 551 collect an award. Black, Asian and minority ethnic background recipients account for 9.2%."

2017-12-31,The UK's busiest train station will be hit by delays and cancellations on New Year's Eve due to another round of strikes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180101032207/https://news.sky.com/story/new-years-eve-rail-strike-to-hit-uks-busiest-station-11189021,"The long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains will impact South Western Railway (SWR) services to and from London Waterloo on Sunday, with members of the Rail, Union and Transport (RMT) union set to walk out for 24 hours. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said it was ""impossible to negotiate"" a resolution because the Government's position has caused ""chaos and confusion"" in the rail industry. Mr Cash added: ""It's the continuing failure of the train companies and their political puppet masters in government to make any attempt whatsoever to resolve the range of separate disputes over rail safety that has led us to call this further action on SWR, and the responsibility for the disruption that will be caused lays fairly and squarely at their door. ""It really should be straight forward - the Scottish and Welsh governments have agreed to keep the guards on our trains so there is no reason why the UK government and the UK-based operators cannot do the same."" SWR say there are contingency plans in place to run approximately three-quarters of its normal service on New Year's Eve. Managing director Andy Mellors said the operator was committed to keeping guards on board all of its trains, but said talks with RMT were needed to clarify what would happen if a guard became unavailable at short notice. ""The RMT executive knows we plan to keep a guard on all our trains to assist passengers,"" he said. ""What we want to discuss with them is what happens when a guard is unavailable at short notice so that our passengers aren't left stranded. ""We have given them repeated reassurances that we will need more guards as we introduce new and longer trains. ""All our passengers want to do is to travel to be with their friends and loved ones for the New Year celebrations."" CrossCountry will also be hit by a New Year's Eve walkout over rosters and Sunday working hours, despite three days of talks before Christmas. A company spokesman urged RMT to call off the strike and take up an offer of a 48% increase to employees' Sunday overtime rate, but Mr Cash has accused the operator of ""ineptitude and arrogance"". More RMT strikes are expected in January, focusing on the train guards issue, with SWR, Southern, Merseyrail, Greater Anglia and Arriva Rail North all set to be affected. Rail minister Paul Maynard slammed the latest round of strike action as ""disgraceful"" and accused RMT of ""seeking to cause misery to paying customers trying to get home to family and friends for the New Year"". The disruption comes as the Government faces increased scrutiny over the ownership of Britain's rail operators, with a new investigation finding that 57% of passenger journeys in the 12 months to September were on foreign-owned services - mainly German and Dutch. London Overground is the country's busiest rail company fully or partly owned overseas with 189 million journeys. It is part of Arriva, which is a subsidiary of German state-owned Deutsche Bahn. Northern is owned by the same firm, SWR is owned by Hong Kong company MTR, West Midlands Railway has its ownership based in the Netherlands and Japan, and Italian state operator Trenitalia runs the c2c franchise."

It's an honour and a pleasure to be considered and acknowledged for my music and my charity work, both of which I love. Peace and love. Ringo."" There are also knighthoods for Bee Gees co-founder Barry Gibb, former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and War Horse author Michael Murpurgo. Strictly Come Dancing judge and former top ballerina Darcey Bussell is made a dame. Ms Bussell said: ""I am truly humbled to receive this honour. I gratefully accept it on behalf of all the dance organisations that I am so fortunate to be part of. Dance is such a beautiful art form, it is inspiring and provides joy, social cohesion and wellbeing.""

After learning of her CBE, Ms Swinson said: ""I'm delighted that my work has been recognised in this way. It wouldn't be possible without the support of my constituents, whom I'd like to thank for giving me the opportunity to serve as their MP once more. ""It is an honour to be listed among so many remarkable people from all walks of life, making amazing contributions right across our country."" The knighthood for Ms Swinson's fellow Liberal Democrat Mr Clegg has led to anger that Brexit rival Nigel Farage failed to make the cut again. Mr Farage said getting an honour was not an ""aspiration"" for him but did criticise the awards given to backbench MPs on both sides, saying they were given for ""services to the establishment"".

Her Twitter account, run by her family and friends since she became ill, asked that she be remembered as a mother, daughter, sister and aunt with a heart ""bigger than the world."" Ms Garner became an activist against police brutality after the July 2014 death of her father, Eric Garner. Mr Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, died while New York City officers attempted to arrest him on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes. One officer subdued him with a chokehold. Mr Garner also suffered from asthma. His last words, ""I can't breathe,"" became a slogan for activists during protests across the US in 2014 against police brutality, particularly against black people. Ms Garner often wore clothing emblazoned with the phrase. ""She was a warrior to the end. She stood up for justice for her father,"" the Reverend Al Sharpton said in announcing her death at a New York hospital. Ms Garner had given birth four months ago to a son, named after her father. He also had an eight-year-old daughter, reports said. The New York Police Department has banned the use of chokeholds on suspects for more than two decades. However, it decided against indicting Daniel Pantaleo, the white officer who sought to subdue Mr Garner, in a move that sparked criticism."

A @WhichTravel investigation reveals that travellers could be getting duped by misleading holiday deals. https://t.co/bCycRf8J2L A study carried out by Which? Travel found that several popular holiday companies could be breaking the law by seducing customers with misleading time-limited deals. After tracking 30 deals, the watchdog found that over half were the same price or cheaper after the offer ended. Among the deals noted, a one-week Virgin Holiday to Florida became £115 cheaper after the deal ended. An all-inclusive seven-day Sandals break to Jamaica dropped in price by £50 the day after the sale ended. And discounted trips to Capri and Milan with travel company Inghams were still available one month after the promotional offer came to a close. Responding to the report, Sandals said they don't create false time limitations and promote their packages to customers fairly. Virgin Holidays said they do not intentionally mislead customers. ""We're always looking to secure the best possible value for our customers, and should we be able to obtain better offers from our suppliers, these savings will be passed on to benefit the customer,"" the company said. And Inghams say they are now ""reviewing all procedures"" in light of the study. Which? Travel editor Rory Boland advised holidaymakers: ""Don't be fooled - compare prices with other holiday companies and travel agents to check savings are genuine."" Which? are now sharing their findings with the Advertising Standards Authority and Trading Standards. The Association of British Travel Agents said that ""the Which? findings relate to a small number of instances and we do not believe they are reflective of wider travel industry practice"".

His two sons, 23-year-old Edward and 25-year-old William, also lost their lives when the plane came down in the Hawkesbury River off Jerusalem Bay. The fifth British victim was Ms Bowden's daughter Emma, who was 11 years old. Gareth Morgan, their Australian pilot, was the sixth person to die in the crash - with officials describing the Sydney Seaplanes employee as ""experienced"". Mr Cousins was the chief executive of Compass, the world's largest contract catering company, and he was due to step down from the position in March. Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings, from New South Wales Police, told reporters the family had been visiting from the UK. He said: ""These people had come over on holiday to one of most beautiful parts of world and for this to happen at a place like this is just tragic."" Mr Hutchings has appealed for any witnesses to come forward, as 10 recreational boats were believed to be in the area at the time. An investigation into the deadly crash has begun - but although a preliminary report is expected within 30 days, officials have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened. Work is continuing to recover the wreckage of the plane, which is submerged in 13m (42ft) of water.

A witness, who claimed to have overheard the incident, was quoted by The Sun as saying: ""The man appeared to be his with wife and child. Philip was wishing lots of people a Happy New Year and then he spotted this guy with his distinctive beard. ""He pointed at him in a funny way and turned to one of his Royal bodyguards, saying: 'Is that a terrorist?' ""He was obviously having a little joke, but he said it within earshot of the man who burst out laughing and appeared to find the whole thing hilarious. I think Philip knew he was going to be overheard."" Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the claims. The Queen, Princess Anne and Prince Edward also attended the morning service at the Norfolk church, where the Royals traditionally spend Christmas.

""Despite the wound and with blood pouring down his arm, Dan continued tracking with Gil and, shortly after, found a 22-year-old man hiding in bushes."" The pursuit came after officers detained a 16-year-old boy in Walmley in Sutton Coldfield. Both were arrested on suspicion of attempted vehicle theft. PC Thomas, who has been with the force for 16 years, said: ""I was tracking alone with Gil but the officers quickly found me and applied a tourniquet to prevent further blood loss.

Under the system, investigators will be alerted to fraudsters who use the same phone number or a similar writing style while filling out different false claims. The connections are buried in billions of files, and it is thought the intelligent computer software will be able to increase prosecutions for whole groups of gangs. Currently, investigators target individual criminals after Jobcentre Plus workers raise concerns. The DWP says it has extensively trialled the technology, which will scan across the benefit system, including Universal Credit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Personal Independent Payments. Last year, about 5,000 people were prosecuted for benefit fraud and a record £1.1bn in overpaid benefits was recovered. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, David Gauke, said: ""We are committed to tackling benefit fraud, especially from organised crime gangs, because it diverts money from the people who really need it. ""Our fraud investigators work tirelessly to bring criminals to justice and this is just one of the latest and innovative ways we are using cutting-edge technology to protect taxpayer's money."" In November, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £75m in funding for artificial intelligence. Much of the investment will support start-up firms and raise the number of new PhD students in the field to 200 a year. Funding will also reportedly go towards an advisory body to lift barriers to AI development."

There were periodic explosions and flames shooting up the outside of the building as the cars inside burned. Merseyside Police have described the fire as accidental, adding: ""We believe that all vehicles parked in the car park have been destroyed and advise owners to contact their insurance companies. No one has been seriously injured, but crews still trying to contain the blaze have been hampered by strong winds. A reception centre has been set up nearby for people who are unable to get home. The huge blaze next to the Echo Arena, which is on the city's waterfront, forced organisers to cancel the Liverpool International Horse Show. Horses which were on the first level of the car park when the fire broke out were moved into the arena. Nearby buildings - including some apartments - were evacuated because of smoke billowing from the fire. Crews were first called to the car park at 4.42pm and were on scene eight minutes later."

The first street trials have already been successfully completed by UK Autodrive, who worked with JLR, Tata and Ford to test vehicles on public roads in Coventry in the autumn. In spring 2018 a fleet of up to 40 driverless pods will take to the walkways of Milton Keynes to enable passengers to complete the ""last mile"" of their journeys in the town. A pool of volunteers will soon be selected to take part in the trials. However, there is an enormous challenge to overcome all the legal hurdles, insurance questions and physically changing the street furniture to accommodate the new technology in Milton Keynes, let alone other UK towns and cities. Sky News was given access to some of the final testing of the Milton Keynes autonomous pods at the purpose-built research arena in Coventry run by manufacturer Aurrigo. Engineering manager Nick Ridler described the deployment in the spring - the biggest autonomous vehicle project ever attempted in the UK - as a ""huge step"". He told Sky News: ""The year coming is the year of autonomy, it is going to hit the streets and people are going to aware of what we can offer and how we can improve lives."" Guide Dogs for the Blind is one of many organisations working with the development of the vehicles to try to ensure manufacturers think of every road user and every possible scenario. Aurrigo chief executive Dave Keene acknowledges that the public still needs to be convinced about driverless vehicles but is confident the technology will ultimately reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Britain's roads. ""The guarantee is that we are spending hundreds and hundreds of man years of testing, we are doing thousands and thousands of tests every minute to prove categorically that these vehicles are safe,"" he said. The ""last mile"" concept is, he believes, an achievable short-term goal. Mr Keene said: ""We have all had experience where we get to a train station and we say to a taxi driver, who may have queued for 30 minutes outside the station, I want to go to a location and he knows that is only 600m or a kilometre away - he doesn't want to take you on that last mile and come back and queue up. ""That is the area where we are going to take over."" A recent report forecast that the connected and automated vehicle technology sector could be worth up to £28bn to the UK economy by 2035. The outcome of the 2018 pod project in Milton Keynes and other research ongoing around the UK will help determine whether those predictions are realistic."

Four men were held in earlier raids carried out in Derbyshire and South Yorkshire on 19 December. A Counter Terrorism Policing North East (CTPNE) spokesperson said: ""The 21-year-old man, from the Fir Vale area of Sheffield, was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. ""The intelligence-led arrest was made in the Firth Park area of Sheffield at approximately 11pm on Friday evening. ""Two addresses, a residential address in Fir Vale and a business address in Firth Park, are currently being searched by officers."" Two of the four men first arrested - Andy Star, 31, and Farhad Salah, 22 - have been charged with one count of engaging in the preparation of an act of terrorism. Both men are Kurdish Iraqis, and Star is the owner of the Mermaid Fish and Chip Bar on Sheffield Road in Chesterfield. They are both due to appear at the Old Bailey in London in January. A 36-year-old man from Burngreave in Sheffield remains in custody, while a 41-year-old from Meersbrook in Sheffield was released on Saturday."
2017-12-31,Dinner For One is a cultural phenomenon. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180101032207/https://news.sky.com/story/why-is-germany-obsessed-with-this-obscure-british-film-11190506,"The 18-minute British sketch has dominated German television every New Year's Eve since 1972, has spawned catchphrases and drinking games, and is almost unheard of in the UK. The black-and-white sketch stars Freddie Frinton as James, an elderly butler serving May Warden's Miss Sophie on her 90th birthday. Miss Sophie has invited her four closest friends for a celebratory dinner, the only problem being that these friends are all long deceased. James is forced to take their place, stumbling around the dinner table, adopting their voices and personas and making toasts on their behalf, knocking back four glasses of sherry, white wine, champagne and port in the process This is clearly not the first time James has had to endure this alcoholic onslaught. Before each course, James asks ""same procedure as last year?"" - to which Miss Sophie replies ""same procedure as every year"". This has become a common expression in Germany, and is an accurate summation of the attitude of German audiences to their much loved film. The sketch ends with a soused and unsteady James escorting Miss Sophie up to her bedroom, with an innuendo-laden ""same procedure as last year?...Well, I'll do my very best."" Millions of Germans plan their New Year's Eve celebrations around the sketch and can quote it line by line. Some even attempt to match James drink for drink, which is no mean feat. According to the Hollywood Reporter, more than 17 million people - around 21% of the German population - tuned in to watch the sketch on 31 December 2016. By comparison, the most watched show in the UK was the final of the Great British Bake Off, which was watched by 15.9 million people. The Dinner for One craze has also spread to Scandinavia, South Africa and Australia. Despite this international success, only 13% of Brits have ever heard of the film, and just 8% said they have actually seen it. Dr Rainer Stollmann, professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bremen, says most Germans are unaware of their beloved film's obscurity in the UK. ""90% of Germans have not realised this,"" Prof Stollmann told me. ""Germans know it as well as they know some of the Grimm fairy tales. They can quote lines from it."" Unsuspecting Brits in Germany might even have the film's catchphrase thrown at them by Germans, assuming the sketch is as well known in the UK as it is Germany. But why did this sketch find a home in Germany and fall into obscurity in the UK? A spokesperson for NDR, a German broadcaster that airs the sketch, said it had ""a timeless humour"" which harks back to ""a nostalgic memory of a time when the entire family used to come together to watch TV"". Prof Stollmann argues Brits are put off by the sketch as it forces them to confront the country's class structure as well as painful moments in its imperial past. The butler repeatedly stumbles over a tiger skin rug laid on the floor, a clear symbol of Britain's occupation of India. The film doesn't have this connection in Germany. Prof Stollmann argues that German audiences merely see the sketch as an illustration of ""a British flair"" and, despite appearing quintessentially British, exudes ""German humour in a British costume"". Regardless of the cause of the sketch's popularity, it has been a mainstay of German festive viewing for nearly 50 years. So, German audiences remain captivated by this silly piece of British slapstick from the sixties. It is a comforting routine. The same procedure as every year."
2017-12-31,The Iranian President insisted his people are free to demonstrate in his first comments since two people were killed in anti-government protests - as long as it does not lead to violence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180101032207/https://news.sky.com/story/two-protesters-killed-at-anti-government-rally-in-iran-11190469,"Hassan Rouhani said his regime must allow ""space for legal criticism"" - but that ""criticism is different to violence and destroying public property"". He also used a cabinet meeting to hit out at US President Donald Trump's comments as the demonstrations entered a fourth day. On Saturday, US President Donald Trump released a series of tweets warning Tehran to respect freedom of speech. ""The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most,"" he wrote. ""Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching!"" On Sunday afternoon Mr Rouhani hit back, saying: ""This man who today in America wants to sympathise with our people has forgotten that a few months ago he called the nation of Iran terrorist."" Iran has blocked access to Instagram and a popular messaging app used by activists to organise anti-government protests that are sweeping across the country. The protests are the largest to hit the country in nearly a decade and President Rouhani is due to address the nation later on Sunday. The protests were organised in part by messages on the Telegram messaging app, which is popular in the country, with images shared on Instagram. Both apps were targeted by authorities. Iranian state television quoted a source as saying: ""It has been decided in the highest security level to restrict access to Telegram and Instagram."" Telegram CEO Pavel Durov wrote on Twitter that ""Iranian authorities are blocking access to Telegram for the majority of Iranians after our public refusal to shut down ... peacefully protesting channels."" The governor of Lorestan province, Habibollah Khojastehpour, told state television that two people had been killed. ""On Saturday evening, there was an illegal protest in Dorud and a number of people took to the streets responding to calls from hostile groups, leading to clashes,"" he said. ""Unfortunately in these clashes two citizens from Dorud were killed."" He said ""no shots were fired by the police and security forces"", and blamed ""foreign agents"" and ""enemies of the revolutions"". Videos appearing to show the bloodied bodies of those said to have been killed has been widely shared on social media, but there has been no independent verification of footage. A Revolutionary Guards Telegram channel said the deaths had been caused by ""people armed with hunting and military weapons"" who ""entered the protests and started shooting randomly toward the crowd and the governor's building"". Watching events in Iran with concern. Vital that citizens should have the right to demonstrate peacefully. The channel also said six people were wounded. The protests were prompted by discontent over the country's weak economy and alleged corruption. Speaking on state television early on Sunday, Iranian interior minister Abdolrahman Rahmani Fazli warned protesters. ""Those who damage public property, disrupt order and break the law must be responsible for their behaviour and pay the price,"" he said. Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption & its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests There has been a cautious response to the protests from the West. The Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted: ""Watching events in Iran with concern. Vital that citizens should have the right to demonstrate peacefully."" The protests originally began in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, when hundreds of people took to the streets to protest against high prices. The unrest then spread to Tehran, and quickly turned against the Islamic regime as a whole. Police used water cannon in some cases to disperse the crowds. On Saturday, tens of thousands of government supporters marched in cities across Iran in a show of support for the regime. Many of the marchers carried banners backing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Some 200 people were arrested. In 2009, Iran saw eight months of civil unrest when tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest Iran's disputed 2009 presidential election."
2017-12-31,A lawyer who advised ministers during the meltdown in Britain's banking ‎system in 2008 is a leading candidate to become the next chairman of the City regulator.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180101032207/https://news.sky.com/story/banking-crisis-lawyer-randell-leads-race-to-chair-city-watchdog-11190784,"Sky News has learnt that Charles‎ Randell, a former partner at the 'Magic Circle' law firm Slaughter & May, is in talks about succeeding John Griffith-Jones at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Sources said that Philip Hammond, ‎the Chancellor, is expected to agree the appointment of the new FCA chairman within days, adding that an announcement could be made by the Treasury as early as Tuesday. At least one other - unidentified - candidate is thought to have been in contention for the post as recently as this month, they said. The new chair will also take the same role at the Payment Systems Regulator‎, and have responsibility for approving the budgets of related bodies including the Money Advice Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. If Mr Randell does get the nod for the posts, it would reunite him with Andrew Bailey, the FCA's chief executive and former boss of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Mr Randell sits on the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC), where his five‎-year term as a director is due to expire at the end of March. The Treasury announced last summer that Mr Griffith-Jones would step down in the spring of 2018 - meaning that the timing of Mr Randell's departure from the PRC would dovetail neatly with the vacancy at its sister regulator. The outgoing chairman‎'s tenure has been marred by pockets of controversy, as well as criticism that his earlier career at KPMG, the accountancy firm, gave rise to unacceptable potential conflicts of interest amid probes into crises at banks audited by KPMG. One City source said the Treasury had decided at the start of the recruitment process that it did not want Mr Griffith-Jones' successor to be drawn from the ranks of the big four acc‎ountancy firms because of the conflicts issue. Another regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, has only just published a report explaining why it did not take further action against KPMG over its auditing of HBOS. Arguably Mr Griffith-Jones' worst moment came in 2014, when the City regulator botched a briefing of a review of the life insurance sector, causing billions of pounds to be wiped‎ off the value of listed insurers. Mr Randell is regarded as possessing one of the City's safest pairs of hands. He was an omnipresent figure at the Treasury from the summer of 2007, advising ministers on their response to the run on Northern Rock, the collapse of Iceland's biggest banks and the bailout of Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. During his stint at the PRA, he played an important role in evaluating the official report on the collapse of HBOS, which was published in 2015. The former lawyer also sits on the board of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. With Mr Bailey now firmly ‎installed at the helm of the FCA, the Treasury will rely on the new leadership team to steer the watchdog through the relocation of its headquarters and the potentially choppy waters of Brexit. The FCA‎ and Mr Randell both declined to comment, while the Treasury could not be reached for comment."
2017-12-31,"Sky reporters and correspondents covering politics, the US, entertainment and sport have gazed into their crystal balls to predict what might happen in 2018.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180101032207/https://news.sky.com/story/world-cup-winners-and-brexits-progress-sky-writers-try-to-predict-2018-11184106,"Sky's Political Correspondent mulls over the biggest political question of modern British history: Where on earth will Brexit be by end of 2018? Will we be out?  No, but there won't be long to wait. Our official exit date is 29 March 2019 - exactly two years after Theresa May triggered Article 50. Brexiteer ministers want a celebration on the day, so brace yourselves for plans for ceremonial downings of EU flags and proclamations of our independence. So we'll be on the brink of a major change?  Not exactly, because the Government wants our exit to be followed to be a two-year ""transition period"" which they also sometimes call an ""implementation period"". The EU has made clear that during this period, which they say should end by December 2020, everything - trade, free movement of people, the European Court of Justice - has to stay the same as it is now, and they will not budge on that. How will the negotiations have progressed then?  Hopefully quite a bit, because the UK is under pressure to agree the broad outlines of our future trade relationship with the EU by October 2018. That leaves five months for it to be approved by Parliaments of the 27 other members and - following a victory for Tory rebels - by our Parliament. Look out for the regional assemblies: the Wallonia region of Belgium nearly blocked a major deal between the EU and Canada last year. What issues will be the most difficult? The Government wants the EU to give us a special or ""bespoke"" deal, unlike any done before, in which we continue to sell goods and - crucially - services across borders with no checks or tariffs. How trade and movement will work across the Northern Ireland border will need to be resolved, as will our future immigration policy. Businesses will be announcing their plans for jobs and investment in the UK, too. Who will be doing the negotiating? The next election is scheduled for 2022 but unpredictable things have been happening recently and Jeremy Corbyn has predicted he will win power next year. I'd be surprised. Tory MPs don't want another election, and the vast majority of them want Theresa May to stay on as leader until we officially leave. The big question is whether she can keep her divided Cabinet on side - or whether walkouts are on the cards. After reporting on a remarkable year in America's history, Sky's US Correspondent attempts to answer this: What will 2018 hold for the States? Hmmmm. I'm not sure I want to make any predictions at all about America any more. Who would have guessed that 2017 was going to become the particularly wild mash-up of events that it did? Hurricanes, mass shootings, #metoo, Russia, fake news... a relentless carousel of themes and stories played out amid Twitterstorms in the ether and protests in the streets. Story of HM the Queen shooting down Sadiq Khan for his idiotic Trump comments is quite obv fake news. (Would love it to be true, of course.) Being a journalist in the States increasingly feels like being on a rollercoaster. Blindfolded. But I think I can safely say the following: President Donald Trump's contempt for journalists will intensify. He is not the only person who believes in the concept of ""fake news"", but he is the idea's champion. It's having a pretty horrible effect on the attitude of the general public towards the media in this country. You can argue about whether the media has in fact done a good enough job upholding standards, but my point here is about a general tone of contempt. At best this is making it harder to find and communicate facts. At worst, it's possible this toxic disintegration of trust could result in physical attacks on journalists. I also think that the Republican Party will rally much more firmly around the president as the midterms approach in 2018. There's some evidence of this already. A lot of it is about political survival and maintaining control of both branches of Congress. But it's also about the sheer force of character of the man. I think that Republicans have started to make the calculation that engaging in a civil war over their unorthodox leader will do so much long-term damage to their party that it is better to just set about holding on for the next few years, maintaining as much influence as possible, and avoiding any displays of weakness that would hand advantage to the Democrats. That is unless the Russia scandal swamps the Oval Office. Quite honestly, I am not going to predict what special counsel Robert Mueller's next moves will be. But if he finds evidence that proves Donald Trump himself, and not just his senior campaign staff or family, was in contact or in any other way unethically involved with Russia, then it's hard to see how Mr Trump survives. Is it possible that will happen in 2018? Yes. Is it possible it won't? Yes. Sorry, but you did ask. Our Entertainment Reporter shares his thoughts on which films will be a contender for the coveted Best Picture gong at the Oscars. This is arguably the hardest category to predict because, unlike the Golden Globes, the good folks at the Academy do not distinguish between comedy and drama. This year, a few films tick all the politically charged boxes necessary to get at least get a nod. Here are my predictions: Call Me By Your Name: Luca Guadagnino's gay romance would have been too indie for the Academy. But this was before Moonlight. Now, it's pitch perfect - even with the controversial age difference. Darkest Hour: Sombre biopic? Churchill? Gary Oldman? I would say yeah, very likely. Get Out: An African-American man is trapped inside a house of deranged middle-class white folks. If it doesn't get the nod, I predict hashtags. The Post: It's Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. And if that wasn't enough, it's about the importance of the media to keep the political power in line. Great timing, Steve. The Shape Of Water: Already an awards favourite, Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi love story is sure to enchant even the most dormant Academy hearts. Phantom Thread: Daniel Day-Lewis's last role has caused surprisingly little buzz, and even been ignored in some circuits. Hopefully though, the Academy will once again ""drink the milkshake"". Lady Bird: Actress Greta Gerwig's debut feature behind the camera has broken Rotten Tomatoes' tomato-meter (yes, that's a good thing), so it could be heading for the Oscars. Dunkirk: Christopher Nolan's war epic has divided critics and One Direction fans, but it would be odd for the Academy not to consider it. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: Martin McDonagh's stage-like drama has been praised by critics but also accused of treading lightly on important issues. Sounds controversial enough to make it. Sky's Sports Editor looks into the stars and nails his colours to the mast with a prediction on which team will lift the World Cup during the summer tournament in Russia. France. But haven't others got the best players? Lionel Messi, you mean? And Cristiano Ronaldo? Well yes, but those star individuals don't guarantee success for Argentina and Portugal. Five-times winners Brazil, with the brilliant Neymar pulling the strings, have as good an 11 as anyone. And never write off reigning champions Germany at a major tournament. But history is against them. No one has won two World Cups in a row for more than 50 years. England? Not quite good enough yet. So why France? Because you don't win a World Cup now without a fantastic squad. And France have one. No matter which of their 23 men play, no matter who gets injured, they will field a world-class team. Teenage goalscoring sensation Kylian Mbappe has just become the youngest ever to net 10 Champions League goals. But France also have Griezmann, Giroud, Lacazette and Martial, to name but four attacking threats. It's pretty similar throughout the team. And the manager? Who better? Didier Deschamps, in charge since 2012, has a contract until 2020. And he's the ultimate been-there-seen-it-done-it boss - as captain for France's only World Cup triumph, on home soil in 1998. Standby for victory parades under the Arc de Triomphe again on 15 July."

2017-12-31,"Twenty years after Paul McCartney was knighted, and 17 years after George Harrison turned down an OBE, Beatles drummer Ringo Starr has been awarded a knighthood for services to music and charity work.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180101032207/https://news.sky.com/story/opinion-ringo-starrs-knighthood-is-long-overdue-11188896,"It will be the first time the musician has been to Buckingham Palace since the band received MBEs back in 1965. Music journalist and Beatles fan Andy Welch looks back on the 77-year-old's legacy. Arise Sir Ringo. And not a moment too soon. In fact, the knighthood of the Beatles drummer is hugely overdue. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were, of course, the driving force behind the band, widely regarded as the greatest of British exports, with notable songwriting additions from George Harrison. As a result, McCartney was knighted in 1997, quite rightly the first popular music icon to be awarded the honour for services to British music, years ahead of Mick Jagger, Cliff Richard and the rest. It's perhaps safe to assume the honour would have at least been offered to Lennon too had he not died in 1980. Whether he'd have accepted - he returned his MBE, awarded in 1965 alongside the rest of The Beatles - is another matter. The same could be said for Harrison, who sadly died in 2001. Ringo should not have had to wait anywhere near so long, not when the honours are handed to sports stars, actors and politicians whose achievements and impact on the world pales in comparison with his. As one of two remaining Beatles, he can't help but be in the shadow of the creative colossus that is Paul McCartney. But Ringo was a quarter of the greatest cultural force the world has ever seen. And a brilliant part of it at that. ""John Lennon said he wasn't even the best drummer in The Beatles."" Quiet at the back. Lennon never said anything of the sort, that joke was made by one-time TV staple Jasper Carrott in about 1983. It's attitudes like that wrongly attributed 'joke' that have, I believe, held back Ringo's right and proper treatment. It's all part of the same pernicious, lazy perceived wisdom among pub bores and casual fans around the country that Ringo was some sort of talent-less journeyman, in the right place at the right time. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was nowhere to hide in that band. The next time you listen to a Beatles track, listen closely to the drums. Ringo's drumming, so fluid, so intuitive, is unlike virtually every other rock and roll drummer before or since. It couldn't be anyone else on the drum stool. He played the song, rather than merely adding a beat. His drumming has feel, he could swing like no other. Imagine, if you can, Beatles songs without his playing. It's impossible. After The Beatles was his solo work. Of course, it never hit the heights of his three bandmates. There are, however, diamonds in the rough - check out It Don't Come Easy and Photograph, if you need persuading. His tours with his All Starr Band are hugely successful. There's also his underrated acting career, Thomas the Tank Engine narration, and philanthropy - one auction of his belongings in 2015 raised more than $9m (£6m) for his and wife Barbara Bach's Lotus Foundation. Not bad for a boy from Liverpool. So arise Sir Ringo, better late than never."

Acknowledging that ""any year brings its challenges"", Mrs May said she would look to deliver ""an economy that's fit for the future and a stronger and fairer society for everyone"". In an attack on Mrs May and the Conservatives, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the Government as ""weak and divided and stuck in an outdated rut with no new ideas"". The Leader of the Opposition claimed the UK was being ""held back by a self-serving elite who look after themselves and their friends"", adding June's election showed ""the establishment's secret is out, they're not as strong as they appear"". And underlining his credentials for No 10, Mr Corbyn said he led a ""government in waiting"" which was ""staking out the new centre ground"" and could herald a ""new Britain, run in the interests of the many, not the few"". Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said his party ""have a lot of people to persuade to get behind us"" but could ""make 2018 our year"". Renewing his call for a second EU referendum, Sir Vince said his party would ""offer the choice of an exit from Brexit"" but warned members they still have ""a lot of work to do"" to win over hearts and minds. In her New Year message, Mrs May asserted that the Government had made good progress on Brexit after securing an agreement to move on to the second phase of talks. She said: ""Next year we will move on to the vital issues of trade and security, and I am determined that we will keep up our progress in 2018. ""Because whichever way you voted in the referendum, most people just want the Government to get on and deliver a good Brexit, and that's exactly what we are doing. ""Making a success of Brexit is crucial, but it will not be the limit of our ambitions."" In recent days, Mr Corbyn has been forced to deny claims his party's position on Brexit is ""confusing"", with opposition frontbenchers appearing to contradict each other on the UK's single market and customs union membership. But the Labour leader opted against addressing the issue in his New Year message, failing to mention Brexit once."
