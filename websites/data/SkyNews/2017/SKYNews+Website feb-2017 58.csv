2017-02-04,"The house always wins, or so received wisdom has it, but your local bookmaker could be forgiven for looking forlorn right now.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/betting-against-gambling-may-be-a-losing-game-10749992,"The industry is up in arms over a report by the Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) All-Party Parliamentary Group. That report calls for a £2 per spin maximum stake to be imposed on all such machines, which are routinely described as the ""crack cocaine"" of betting. Currently, punters may stake up to £100 per spin on the machines every 20 seconds. The group's report also urges the ""speed of spin"" on the machines to be reduced and calls for local authorities to be given more powers to prevent ""clustering"" of betting shops on high streets. The group adds: ""The evidence suggests FOBTs are having a clear negative impact on the young and the vulnerable, driving problem gambling, addictive behaviour and impacting on families and communities more widely. The group has heard many tragic stories to this effect. ""FOBTs are having wide-ranging impacts on local communities and there are clear impacts on people's mental health."" The group has some powerful backers. Senior figures from the Church of England and the Quakers support its cause. It also lined up betting industry figures, including the former chairman of Paddy Power, as well as former Ladbrokes employees who testified the machines can cause outbreaks of violence in betting shops. The bookies, which refused to participate in the hearings held by the group, are unhappy. The Association of British Bookmakers described the group's hearings as a ""kangaroo court"" and points out the group was ""financed by those with interests in the casino, arcade and pub industries"". So, who's right? Well, there is no doubt that, for some gamblers, FOBTs have been destructive. And there is also no doubt that the bookies have an advantage to pubs and casinos. The number of old-fashioned amusement arcades on Britain's high streets has halved during the last decade as business has been lost to the betting chains. Britain's pubs, where the maximum stake on gaming machines is just £1, have also lost business: JD Wetherspoon - one of the companies, along with the Hippodrome Casino and Bacta, the trade association for gaming machine suppliers, who made financial donations to the group - reported last year that the proportion of its revenues coming from machines has halved during the last 15 years from 6% to 3%. But the picture is more complicated than the MPs suggest. The latest Gambling Commission statistics suggest the number of FOBTs in Britain is actually falling. Look at the individual reports of the quoted high street bookies and it is clear the proportion of major sums being staked is also falling: the latest numbers from Ladbrokes, for example, reveal the number of times £50 or more was staked on a terminal was down by 68% year-on-year. Fred Done, co-founder of BetFred, revealed earlier this month that the average stake per spin in one of his betting shops has fallen from £4.73 three years ago to £4.01 now. Moreover, according to the latest Gambling Commission data, there is no evidence problem gambling is on the rise: the level is roughly the same as ever. And, as the Labour MP Michael Dugher pointed out recently, levels of problem gambling are far higher among people who play the National Lottery's scratchcards or who play on online slot machines than they are among users of FOBTs. A clampdown on FOBTs may or may not accelerate high street betting shop closures. The FOBTs All-Party Parliamentary Group says there is little evidence for this, while the ABB says there is. However, the chances are that more betting shops will close over coming years in any case: betting is increasingly moving to an online and mobile environment, which is cheaper for the bookies than traditional betting shops, the operating costs of which are being driven ever higher by factors such as business rates and payroll taxes. So perhaps the MPs on this group should be careful what they wish for. It may prove quite a disappointment for them when betting shops and the 43,000 jobs they provide are not replaced by a rash of openings of stores selling organic fruit & veg, sourdough bread, scented candles or fancy stationery. And with the betting industry paying some £1.5bn in taxes last year - William Hill's tax bill last year was nearly twice its full year pre-tax profits - the Treasury will also miss them. There will be one more rude awakening for anti-FOBT MPs. Anyone with a smartphone can access the online equivalent of a FOBT. A clampdown on FOBTs in betting shops is unlikely to remove the misery they undoubtedly cause on occasions."
2017-02-04,Thousands have marched through London calling on Theresa May to cancel Donald Trump's state visit later this year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/thousands-march-through-london-against-donald-trumps-state-visit-10755743,"Demonstrators set off from the US embassy and walked towards Downing Street displaying placards and chanting ""Theresa May, shame on you"". The passionate but peaceful protest was set up by groups including the Stop the War Coalition, Stand Up to Racism and the Muslim Association of Britain. A protestor from Redhill in Surrey told Sky News: ""The livelihood of the world is under pressure and we're all scared… We've all got to do our bit to stop him coming to this country, bringing his views to this country and to stop him."" Another said: ""I don't think you can ban any one group of people"". Hours after Mrs May issued the invitation during a trip to the White House last month, Mr Trump introduced a controversial 90-day travel ban. The restrictions are aimed at residents from seven predominantly Muslim countries - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The executive order has sparked anger around the world, with protesters calling it a ""Muslim ban"" and demanding it be overturned. US District Judge James Robart has now ruled against government lawyers at a hearing in Seattle, saying there was a strong likelihood that a legal challenge against the ban would succeed. The White House called his ruling ""ridiculous"", insisting the ban is ""lawful and appropriate"", and stated its intention to file ""an emergency stay of this order"" at the earliest possible opportunity. An online petition to stop Mr Trump's UK state visit has received more than 1.8 million signatures. The petition is due to be debated in Parliament later this month; however, Downing Street has insisted the state visit will go ahead."
2017-02-04,"Cancer cases among women are rising six times faster than in men, according to new research.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/cancer-cases-among-women-rising-six-times-faster-than-men-10753927,"According to Cancer Research UK, unhealthy lifestyles are responsible for the rise in cancer cases among both sexes - but women are bearing the brunt of the increase. Obesity is one of the factors that can increase the risk of cancers that only affect women, such as womb cancer and ovarian cancer. Cervical and oral cancers are also on the rise in women. Smoking rates are now falling across the UK - but lung cancer figures are beginning to reflect women who took up the habit over recent decades. The charity says that cancer rates will continue to climb nearly six times faster in women than men over the next 20 years. Cancer cases will rise by around 0.5% for men and 3% for women, meaning that an estimated 4.5 million women and 4.8 million men will be diagnosed with cancer by 2035. Breast, prostate, lung and bowel cancer are the most common cancers, accounting for more than half (53%) of new cases of cancer each year. Cases of breast cancer are expected to rise from 54,833 in 2014 to 71,022 in 2035. Ovarian cancer cases will rise from 7,367 to 10,500, while lung cancer cases will go up from 21,633 to 29,957. Sarah Toule, head of health information at World Cancer Research Fund, said: ""Cancer is a devastating disease and it is concerning that rates are predicted to rise so sharply in women, especially as so many cancer cases could be prevented. ""In fact, our evidence shows that around a third of the most common cancer cases could be prevented if people were a healthy weight, had a healthier diet and were more active. ""For breast cancer, this would mean preventing around two in five cases."" Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: ""These new figures reveal the huge challenge we continue to face, both in the UK and worldwide."""
2017-02-04,Police in London have arrested two people in connection with the suspected hacking of a camera system in Washington DC.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/london-pair-held-over-us-camera-hack-ahead-of-trump-inauguration-10755399,"The Washington Post claims storage devices which record data from police surveillance cameras were accessed between 12 and 15 January. Donald Trump was inaugurated in the US capital just days later. The National Crime Agency said a man and a woman were arrested on Natal Road in Streatham in south London on 19 January. The suspects, who are both believed to be 50, are said to be a Swedish woman and a man from the UK. The NCA could not confirm why they were arrested, and the pair have been bailed until April. A spokeswoman said: ""Enquiries are ongoing and we are unable to provide further information at this time."" According to US media, the cyberattack affected 123 of the 187 network video recorders in the CCTV system for public spaces across the District of Columbia. Officials said ransomware was discovered on the camera system, which is designed to encrypt files and shut users out until ransom demands are met. However, the malicious software was removed without any cash being paid, and officials stressed that public safety during the inauguration was not compromised at any stage."
2017-02-04,"Several police raids have been conducted in Paris after a ""terrorist"" tried to enter the Louvre museum carrying machetes.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/police-raids-in-paris-after-terrorist-shot-by-soldier-at-louvre-10755190,"The suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Abdullah Reda Refaei al-Hamamy, who lives in the United Arab Emirates but is originally from Egypt, according to security sources. He was shot five times after lunging at four French soldiers outside the Paris landmark. The assailant shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" while holding a machete in each hand, and prosecutors said he was hovering between life and death after being subdued by one of the patrolmen. A raid was carried out last night at an apartment near the tree-lined Champs-Elysees where cash, an Egyptian passport, and a driver's licence issued by the UAE were discovered. It is believed the suspect arrived in France on 26 January after acquiring a one-month tourist visa in Dubai. Parisian prosecutor Francois Molins said the suspect had bought two military machetes at a gun store in Paris on 28 January, and it is believed that the attacker's return flight to Dubai was scheduled for tomorrow. The man was wearing a black T-shirt adorned with a skull design when he targeted the soldiers, and apparently became violent when he was told he could not enter the Louvre with his bags. No explosives were found in his backpack, which only contained cans of spray paint. As many as 1,200 people were locked inside windowless rooms within the museum as the incident was dealt with, and groups were only allowed to leave once their identities had been checked. Witnesses reported seeing a crowd of people running away from the scene and screaming. One Twitter user, called Maya, wrote: ""We've all been locked inside... there are hundreds of vans outside."" The Louvre remained closed on Friday but culture minister Audrey Azoulay said it would reopen today. President Francois Hollande praised the soldiers for preventing a terror attack, and Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the attack was ""of a terrorist nature"". The soldier who opened fire was part of Operation Sentinelle, the massive deployment of French military in response to recent attacks. Interior minister Bruno Le Roux praised the patrol involved, saying: ""To wear a uniform, as we can see in the propaganda of those who want to attack us, is to be a target."" France has been on its highest state of alert following terror attacks in Paris and Nice in the last two years. Annual visitor numbers at the Louvre have suffered as a result - falling by more than two million as the tourism industry takes a hit, with visitors cancelling their trips or shortening their stays. The incident came hours before Paris unveiled its bid to host the Olympics in 2024. It would be the first time the French city has hosted a summer games in 100 years, but it faces stiff competition from Los Angeles and Budapest. Security is also becoming a crucial campaign issue for candidates in May's presidential election."

The intervention came at an EU summit in Malta in which the 27 other leaders discussed Brexit as part of wider talks on the challenges facing the union. Maris Kucinskis said: ""What is most important is to think about a beneficial partnership (and) find an amicable solution to all of this. ""There are negotiators who are taking care of the best possible deal for both sides so that's the top priority at the moment."" Mr Kucinskis also made clear that the EU is looking for the best possible trade deal with the UK. ""Every member state is looking to build the best possible trading relationship with the UK and I think that the whole union will also benefit from a strong trading relationship with the UK,"" he said. The Latvian leader's remarks are likely to be welcomed by the Government as a sign that Britain might be able to maximise its access to the single market. He also revealed that reaching an agreement on reciprocal rights for each other's citizens was a ""top priority"". It follows remarks from Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who told the Theresa May in Malta he wanted ""early agreement"" on the issue. With the expectation that Parliament will pass the Brexit Bill next week, the official process for exiting the European Union is likely to be triggered next month. Article 50 could be invoked as early as the next EU Council meeting on 9 and 10 March. Mrs May yesterday faced criticism at the informal summit in Valletta for suggesting that Britain could be a bridge between the new Trump administration and Europe. In a stinging rebuke, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: ""I don't think there is a necessity for a bridge ... we communicate with the Americans on Twitter."" But the possibility was encouraged by the Latvian Prime Minister, who added he was pleased with the continued commitment to NATO. ""If Mrs May helps facilitate the relationship between the EU and the US that would be highly welcome,"" Mr Kucinskis said."

French president Francois Hollande warned European countries which lean towards Mr Trump ""that there is no future with Trump if it is not a common position"". Theresa May was attempting to use the summit to persuade her European counterparts to increase defence spending to meet NATO limits, following her meeting with the President last month. :: Analysis: No Mrs May, we don't want your Trump bridge Mr Trump had been critical of the alliance, because a number of nations fail to meet the 2% of GDP defence spending limits. However, during Mrs May's Washington visit, she spoke of his ""100% commitment"" to NATO. And after the Malta talks she reaffirmed that point, saying: ""I think it's important that we got the 100% commitment to NATO because NATO has been so crucial in keeping the security, protecting the security, not just of the UK but also of Europe and will do so in the future. ""But as we look to our negotiations, what I want to build with the EU is a strong partnership, we want a strong continuing EU and a strong partnership because we're not leaving Europe, we're leaving the EU."" The Prime Minister was hoping to act as a bridge between the US and the EU, amid increasingly hostile relations. However, arriving at the summit, Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite said: ""I think there is no necessity of bridges… ""Today we are communicating with the United States mainly on Twitter."" It follows comments made to Sky News ahead of the summit by the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, who said that Mrs May would have to choose between Europe and the US. Mrs May also had talks with European leaders including Angela Merkel, Spain's Mariano Rajoy and Austria's Christian Kern at the EU Presidency Summit in Malta in an attempt to build Brexit relationships. Mr Rajoy and Mrs May discussed making an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in Europe. Mrs May has refused to guarantee the status of EU citizens in the UK unless reciprocal arrangements are made for Britons living on the continent. And the Spanish leader backed her hopes for an early deal on the issue. A No 10 source said: ""They discussed the issue of reciprocal rights, and agreed it would be good to get agreement on this issue early on in the negotiations."" :: Maltese Prime Minister tells May she must choose: US or Europe But Mr Trump dominated the comments of the other leaders. Mr Kern said ""Today we have pretty mixed feelings, to be honest, because the tangible aspects of Mr Trump's policies are raising some concerns. ""It's not a threat, it could be a catalyst for a strong, more united Europe. It is an alarm call to see if we are on the right track."" Mr Hollande said: ""Those who want to forge bilateral ties with the US are of course well understood by the public. ""But they must understand that there is no future with Trump if it is not a common position. What matters is solidarity at the EU level. We must not imagine some sort of external protection."" Mrs Merkel said: ""Europe has its destiny in its own hands. I believe that the more strongly we make clear that we will define our own role in the world, the better we will be able to cultivate our transatlantic relationship."" Mrs May will only attend part of the summit but will not be present when the rest of the leaders discuss Brexit."

Staff at the firm, which is contracted to run the Government's electronic monitoring service (EMS), allegedly received £400 a time to help at least 32 offenders evade court-imposed curfews, according to The Sun. Three current and former EMS workers are among those who have been detained by the Metropolitan Police, and the Ministry of Justice says it is ""urgently"" investigating the claims. A 46-year-old man who used to work on the EMS contract was arrested in Essex on 3 January on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, as well as the theft of tagging equipment. Two current employees - a 45-year-old man and a 57-year-old woman who were also from Essex - were arrested on 18 January on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Another 11 people were arrested in connection with the investigation during January. A spokesman for the EMS said: ""We have a zero tolerance policy against any of our employees who act in any way to undermine the robustness of the electronic monitoring service."" All 14 suspects have been bailed until April as the Met's inquiries continue. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sky News he was "" shocked but not surprised"" by the allegations. ""When you privatise services you contract them out and lose control on how they operate,"" he said. This is the latest scandal surrounding electronic tags for criminals, which Capita took on in a six-year deal worth £400m in 2014. G4S and Serco, the security companies which used to be responsible for tagging criminals, lost the contract after it emerged they had overcharged the Ministry of Justice for monitoring offenders who were either dead, back in prison, had their tags removed, had never been tagged or had left the country."

Yellow warnings for wind covering the south and southeast of England and southern Wales have been issued by the Met Office until 3am on Saturday. People taking to the roads during this evening's rush hour are being advised to take extra care. The Environment Agency has issued a handful of flood warnings and some 40 flood alerts covering rivers and coastal areas in the south, west, and east of England. Forecasters had predicted storm Doris could cause severe damage, but they have now scaled back the warning and it is no longer a ""named storm"". :: UK weather: The latest Sky News forecast Sky News Weather Presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""The rain will be heavy at times, but the main concern will be the strength of the winds for southern parts of England, in particular the south coast.

2017-02-04,A serving Royal Marine has admitted stashing arms and explosives for possible use by dissident republicans.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/royal-marine-ciaran-maxwell-pleads-guilty-to-stashing-explosives-for-terror-attacks-10754882,"Ciaran Maxwell, 31, originally from Larne in County Antrim, entered the guilty plea at an Old Bailey hearing in central London. The Marine was arrested by counter-terrorism officers in August 2016 following the discovery of two arms dumps in woodland near Larne. The dumps contained land mines, an improvised armour-piercing rocket, ammunition and other partly constructed improvised explosive devices and components. Subsequent examination of those weapons and explosives gave investigators their most significant clues. They were able to trace some of the explosives back to the British military and eventually to Maxwell. The serviceman, who was based at 40 Commando's barracks near Taunton in Somerset, was detained three months after the discovery of the second arms dump. Officers made another significant breakthrough when they discovered a third arms dump near the Marine's home in Devon. Although he served for years at the heart of one of the UK's most elite units, family and friends said they had no idea Maxwell was living a double life, secretly planning violence against the very state he swore to protect. The 30-year-old grew up in a predominantly Loyalist community. Although Maxwell is Catholic, those who know him have said they were unaware of any links to republican extremists. Sources have told Sky News that the Commando was a lone wolf character, with a determination to carry out attacks and link up with other dissident republicans bent on violence. Maxwell has been remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date. The discovery of the Country Antrim arms dumps sparked a major alert and review of security across Northern Ireland, where a small but determined group of dissidents continue to wage a campaign of violence. Last month, a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officer was shot and wounded in an attack in Belfast. Former PSNI assistant chief constable Stephen White told Sky News: ""The threat is high. The police and intelligence services are on a high state of alert and that is appropriate to the threat and this weapons find is an indication of the threat we face. ""Whether the weapons themselves are complete, or components, the fact is they prove the capability and the intent of dangerous people, and it's very good news that the weapons were seized."" Mr White added: ""I do believe that the security services have been successful in thwarting many of the attempts. ""I think the appetite and political motivation is waning, the support is waning and therefore the supplies are waning, the finance is waning, but there are still some evil people who are getting their hands on weapons."" A review of munitions and weapons security procedures was carried out across the UK's armed forces in the wake of the Royal Marine's arrest."

In 2005 the band was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame and in 2013 MTV ranked them as the Greatest Metal Band of all time. Calling it ""the most incredible adventure"", Osbourne, 68, said Sabbath had now ""run its course"". He went on: ""One of the proudest things I have in my heart is the fact that Black Sabbath wasn't a band that was created by some big mogul. ""It was four guys who said, 'Let's have a dream', and it came true beyond our wildest expectations."" Despite originally saying their 2013 album - 13 - would be their last, the band are now promising an eight track tour-only release, which will include previously unheard songs.

That strategy was to act as a bridge between Washington and Brussels, an honest broker between a Brexit-supporting President and a threatened European Union. :: May told to choose: Europe or US It was with Mr Trump's NATO commitment that she went armed. Last week in Washington the Prime Minister appeared to get the President to commit to NATO ""100%"", after he previously questioned its purpose. What better sign of the UK, twisting the arm of the new US President to the benefit of Europe, particularly its eastern European flank? However, not all of Britain's missions in mainland Europe go well. Within minutes of arriving the French President appeared to cast doubt on that commitment, saying: ""Who knows what President Trump wants on NATO?"" And then a stinging rebuke from Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite: ""I don't think there is a necessity for a bridge.. we communicate with the Americans on Twitter."" This shouldn't come as a surprise. Mr Trump has been very critical of the EU and even predicted its demise in the wake of the historic Brexit vote. Donald Tusk, the EU Council President, said this week that Mr Trump posed as big a threat to the European Union as an assertive China, aggressive Russia or Middle East stability. This while other Europeans express their disquiet at our Prime Minister's cosying up to the man in the Oval Office.

Doctors said it was a miracle that he survived. However, he still has several seizures a day and is now partially sighted. His family say they do not know what Harry's long-term prognosis is because the bullet cannot be removed from his head as it rests against a blood vessel. His mother Amy Allen told Sky News: ""At first I was completely heartbroken when it happened. ""My heart felt like it shattered into a million pieces. Having a normal child go to a disabled child was the hardest part. ""The doctors said to us 'basically we are 100% certain that he's not going to survive'. ""As a mother, my initial reaction was that I wasn't going to say goodbye and so I kissed him on the head and said 'see you later'."" Ms Allen was at a friend's house when the incident happened last summer. Jordan Walters, 24, who has pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm, was cleaning his air rifle and fired it, not realising it was loaded. His partner, Emma Horseman, 24, was found not guilty at Bristol Crown Court on Tuesday. During the two-day trial, prosecutors claimed Ms Horseman had told Mr Walters to shoot the air rifle to scare Harry because he was crying. However, she told the jury she could not remember saying that and was cleared of any wrongdoing. Harry's father, Edward Studley, said: ""We hate Jordan. We can never forgive him for what he's done. ""We respect him for pleading guilty, but we can never forgive him."" Describing the moment he found out what had happened to his son, he said: ""I noticed that I had lots of missed calls. When I found out I dropped everything and ran to get home as quickly as possible. ""He was being treated in the back of an ambulance. He spent about eight days in intensive care. ""He's recovering well, he's got brain damage, suffers daily seizures and he's got a weakened left hand side. But other than that he's a normal boy. Of course, we don't know what will happen long-term."" Walters is due to be sentenced later this month."
2017-02-04,There are warnings that rural communities across the UK will suffer considerably after Brexit unless the Government finds an alternative for the millions of pounds that the EU currently invests in rural tourism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/rural-businesses-fear-tourism-funding-shortfall-after-brexit-10755414,"Last year, businesses up and down the country received £80m through initiatives like the Common Agricultural Policy and the Leader programme. Areas like Cornwall and West Wales and the Valleys, which are regarded as having weaker economies, received additional subsidies. Simon Crow and Greg Millar are among those who have benefited from European Union funding. They received around £55,000 to set up Dartmoor Whisky Distillery in Devon. Nestled in the small town of Bovey Tracey, their business won't just produce whisky, it will also be a tourist attraction when it opens its doors to the public in April. The hope is that it will draw people in from neighbouring areas. Mr Crow told Sky News that they would never have been able to embark on the venture without funding. He said: ""It has enabled us to complete the visitors' centre tourist attraction at a much earlier stage than would have been possible. ""It's extremely difficult to set up a company like this because of the high cost of the distillation equipment and you have to keep investing for three years before you have the finished product to sell. ""Without the funding, it would mean less people would be able to embark on ventures like ours"". Tourism is one of the UK's largest industries, creating around 3.1 million jobs. However, according to the Tourism Alliance, UK national and local government investment has fallen considerably in recent years - from £179m in 2008 to £71m in 2016. Local businesses often apply for EU funding to meet marketing, staffing and startup costs. There is an ongoing inquiry by a group of MPs looking into the role of rural tourism, but those whose livelihoods depend on it want assurances from the Government now. Kurt Janson from the Tourism Alliance told Sky News: ""We need to work out the issues as quickly as possible so that we don't have this cliff edge in two years' time. ""The sooner that we can identify the issue and come up with a replacement scheme, the smoother the transition will be and the better it will be for the rural economy as well"". Post-Brexit, some farmers are likely to diversify into leisure activities as funding for those who rear cows and sheep is likely to drop. That will undoubtedly place even more importance on rural tourism. For many businesses, EU funding is a lifeline. It helps them to start up, it keeps them going. But without that funding there are deep concerns for the future."

Following their discovery, the embalmed bodies were moved to the city mortuary, where they have been kept for almost 15 years. During discussions with Edinburgh City Council, Mr Marcel said he planned to build a refrigerated unit in his home to store the bodies in, until he was able to construct a mausoleum in the grounds of his property. It is understood he then intended to have his parents' remains transferred to the West Bank in the Middle East for burial. Now, a judge has ruled that the council can bury the bodies. Lord Mulholland said Mr Marcel's suggestions ""did not seem to me to be realistic or anything more than a vague statement of intent"". In his written judgment, he said Mr Marcel ""has had ample opportunity to make arrangements to dispose of his parents' bodies in accordance with his and his family's wishes"". The judge added: ""It should be noted that the bodies of the defender's parents have been in the city mortuary for many years, no doubt at some cost to the City of Edinburgh at a time when the public purse is under significant constraint."" Prosecutors were informed after the discoveries of the remains in 2002, but no proceedings were brought and the procurator fiscal said the bodies could be released for burial or cremation. The council and Mr Marcel had been having discussions about the burial of the couple since 2012, with the authority eventually applying for permission to bury them after he failed to make any arrangements. In a statement, the council said it would ""take the necessary and appropriate steps to bury the bodies""."

Frustrated customers have shared photographs of empty supermarket shelves on Twitter. Meanwhile, some online shoppers have been told iceberg, romaine and sweet gem varieties of lettuce are completely out of stock. Some Tesco and Morrisons branches are limiting sales of iceberg lettuces to three per customer because of ""continued weather problems in Spain"". The vast majority of the UK's vegetables come from the city of Murcia in southeastern Spain during the winter months. But severe flooding and freezing conditions have damaged farms across the region - causing millions of euros worth of damage and leaving the ground too soaked to grow new crops. Price rises are possible if the weather does not improve soon, and some healthy eaters have already complained that the cost of an iceberg lettuce has nearly tripled in recent weeks. Some supermarket chains have begun to buy in lettuces from US farms more than 5,300 miles away to address the shortage. In a statement, a spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""Severe weather has affected crops, but we are working with our suppliers to maintain supply for our customers."" A Morrisons spokesman said: ""Our availability of broccoli and iceberg lettuce is good. However, other businesses are experiencing shortages and we have seen some bulk buying in our stores. ""We have therefore had a cap on sales of broccoli and iceberg lettuce to ensure we maintain good supplies for our regular customers. As you can imagine, most customers don't buy more than three broccoli at a time."" Lidl said: ""We're not experiencing any stock issues and as such, aren't limiting our customers to the quantity of vegetables they wish to purchase."""
2017-02-04,Labour is pledging to end a north-south divide in Government spending by introducing new laws to guarantee there is no gap in funding between the English regions.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/shadow-chancellor-john-mcdonnell-targets-governments-north-south-funding-gap-10755206,"Speaking in Liverpool, the city he was born in, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will claim the north of England receives only half as much investment per head as London. His promise is likely to be seen as an acknowledgement by leader Jeremy Corbyn and his allies of the threat posed to Labour by UKIP in northern constituencies that voted for Brexit last year. Mr Corbyn has also been criticised for having eight London MPs - one in three - in his Shadow Cabinet of 24 and all the top jobs, including his own and Mr McDonnell's, filled by MPs from the capital. Labour will also be concerned the Tories appear to be making the running on regional policy with former chancellor George Osborne's Northern Powerhouse, which has been set up to boost economic growth in the North. And so Mr McDonnell, launching new Regional Economic Conferences, will promise a ""Barnett Formula for the North"" to ensure handouts are protected like those to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Barnett Formula, devised in 1978 by Labour's treasury chief secretary Joel Barnett, legally protects and boosts spending in the nations outside England, but it was only ever intended to be temporary. Critics have said devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has made it redundant and even its creator, Lord Barnett, said in 2014 it had become an embarrassment and should be scrapped. Mr McDonnell will propose that future governments should be legally bound to audit regional investment spending and report to Parliament when the bias is greater than economic need can justify. ""We have to put an end to the Whitehall view that what's good for the City of London is good for the country as a whole,"" he will say. ""It's time for the rest of the country to get a look in. ""At present, this Tory Government plans to invest less than half the amount per head in the North that London receives. ""The Crossrail transport link alone is due to cost four times the entire public investment budget for Yorkshire, or six-and-a-half times that for the North East."" According to Labour's figures: :: Public capital expenditure per head in the north of England is £1,491, compared to £3,114 for London. :: Expenditure for Crossrail is £14.5bn, while planned capital expenditure for Yorkshire and Humber is £3.6bn and for the North East £2.23bn. Mr McDonnell will say: ""We can't, as a country, face the world after Brexit if we are not all able to pull together. ""So I can pledge this now: the next Labour government will put in place the mechanisms needed to close that gap in funding. ""We will make sure that no government can ever again bias its own investment plans so heavily against the majority of the country. ""We'll introduce legislation to make sure future governments will be charged with auditing their regional capital spend against economic need, and reporting to Parliament when the investment imbalances are excessive. ""It'll be like a 'Barnett formula for the North'."" Responding to Mr McDonnell's speech, a Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Labour's policy to borrow half a trillion pounds would crash our economy and threaten jobs and infrastructure. ""Our modern industrial strategy puts investment in the Northern Powerhouse at the heart of this Government's Plan for Britain."""
2017-02-04,The House of Commons is to debate next week a motion of no confidence in the Football Association's governance.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170204182658/http://news.sky.com/story/fa-faces-motion-of-no-confidence-debate-in-parliament-10754808,"The debate on 9 February has been secured by the Culture, Media and Sport committee. It said the motion was: ""That this House has no confidence in the ability of the Football Association (FA) to comply fully with its duties as a governing body, as the current governance structures of the FA make it impossible for the organisation to reform itself; and calls on the Government to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the governance of the FA."" The committee said it had published two reports calling for FA reform, ""to allow representatives of fans, women's football, BAME groups, officials such as referees and the grassroots sport a significantly greater say in the governance of the game"". But it added that ""the reforms called for by groups representing the wider game, the Committee, successive ministers for sport and recently, a number of past chairmen and chief executives of the FA, have been ignored by The FA"". It continued: ""It is clear that the FA does not comply with this guidance now and there appears to be considerable resistance to the idea of changing its very out-of-date structure at all. ""The Committee is therefore preparing a draft Bill to bring the structure of the FA - which is, in legal terms, a company - into line with modern company law."" Sports minister Tracey Crouch gave the governing body six months to take meaningful steps to revamp its board and council last October. An FA spokesperson said the organisation was ""aware"" of next week's discussions. ""The Government announced a code for governance for sports governing bodies last year and we are working to their timeline for implementation later in the year. ""Football, like all sports, is following due process and we remain committed to working with the Government towards compliance with the code."" Discussing the issues, Sky's Sports Correspondent, Paul Kelso said the Department of Culture, Media and Sport ""now requires all governing bodies in sport to meet basic standards of good governance or lose their public funding"", for which there is an April deadline. He said the FA gets millions of pounds of public money, but ""falls well short of some of the basic requirements"". At the moment, he added, there is ""one woman out of 12 on the FA's board - the minimum requirement is 30%""."
2017-02-04,"Research appears to confirm the existence of an ""echo chamber"" effect in UK politics, in which social media users are more likely to engage with people and media sources that share their political beliefs.

Researchers analysed the Twitter use of 2,000 people who openly support the Conservatives, Labour, UKIP or the SNP. The study found that supporters of the SNP and UKIP were much less likely to engage with people holding different beliefs, or to tweet material from outlets with opposing editorial stances. Conservative and Labour supporters were more likely to engage with users outside their group. Alex Krasodomski-Jones, who carried out the study, told Sky News: ""The existence of echo chambers and the idea that we are increasingly seeing things that we agree with, things that we like, things that we might buy, challenges some of the fundamental principles democracy thrives on. ""We have to be able to compromise, we have to able to read and accept and understand opposing views. We even need a shared concept of what is true. ""And that again is threatened by the echo chamber."" Previous studies have confirmed the ""echo chamber"" effect on Facebook, measuring how people fall into polarised tribes based on the information they consume and share. Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London, told Sky News that social media platforms ""bear great responsibility"" for the effect. He said: ""They are using only these algorithms to feed us with stories that are completely tailored to us. ""That doesn't allow us to explore diversity to explore another opinion. ""That makes us develop a very limited tunnel vision of reality, of products, of ideology, of political stances. ""However, on the other side it's up to the individual to actively seek alternative ways of informing themselves."""

In a statement following the sentencing, Sheffield City Council apologised for the case and welcomed that Dodds ""has finally been brought to justice after so many years"". Jayne Ludlam, the council's executive director for children, said: ""We are glad to see that, finally, such cases of historic abuse are coming before the courts, justice is being done, and victims are having their voices heard. ""Despite the fact that this happened more than a quarter of a century ago, we have accepted responsibility and would never defend the indefensible."" Following a report of sexual abuse to the NSPCC, South Yorkshire Police opened an investigation into Dodds in 2014. Victims of Dodds told the BBC his abusive behaviour had been well known at Sheffield City Council for many years. They said he used his position dealing with student grants to gain access to young people and was investigated in both the 1980s and 1990s, with no apparent consequences. One victim said: ""The council are so responsible. I even think at times the council are more responsible than he was. They allowed it to happen. Everyone knew. ""Everyone in the council knew but they chose to do nothing about it."" Another said he believed Dodds' five victims ""are just the tip of the iceberg""."

Her left one, which was ruptured by dozens of pellets when she was attacked in 2012, has been removed. The three-hour surgery was performed by British vet Claudia Hartley, who said the procedure could not have gone any better and early signs looked ""very promising"". To carry out the operation, the veterinarian ophthalmologist and her team flew to the Lamandau River wildlife reserve where the primate is being cared for. Ms Hartley, 44, said: ""The surgery went very well, so we're pleased with how it went. I'd like to assess her better tomorrow when she's behaving a bit more normally. ""She's still quite sleepy and keeping the eye shut, so it's difficult to know how much she sees. ""If we shone a bright light in she would then scrunch her eye up, so I'm pretty sure she can recognise the light. ""But we can't assess how well she sees food and trees and obstacles and those sort of things, which is the more critical thing that we need to do."" Ms Hartley, who volunteered to carry out the operation, said she would continue monitoring Aan in an enclosure as the anaesthetic wears off and she becomes more active. The vet will then have a better idea of how much sight the animal has regained. Aan, believed to be aged between 10 and 12, captured the hearts of animal lovers across the world following the attack in a palm oil plantation in Borneo five years ago. If the operation is successful, she will be kept in an enclosure for three to four more weeks to ensure she continues her post-op medication before being released. Around 56,000 orangutans are believed to live in the wild in Borneo. They are critically endangered and reproduce slowly, on average only once every seven to eight years."

When exposed to the noises - or ""trigger sounds"" - sufferers can respond with an intense ""fight or flight"" reaction. Scientists at Newcastle University found a difference in the frontal lobe of the brains of misophonia sufferers, suggesting the condition is genuine, contrary to some previous scepticism. Trigger sounds prompted changes in brain activity that caused a sufferer's brain to go into overdrive. They also found that misophonia sufferers sweated and experienced an increased heart rate when they heard the offending sounds, according to an article in the journal Current Biology. Dr Sukhbinder Kumar, from the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University, said: ""This study demonstrates the critical brain changes as further evidence to convince a sceptical medical community that this is a genuine disorder."" Tim Griffiths, professor of cognitive neurology at Newcastle University and UCL, said he hoped the study would ""reassure"" sufferers. ""I was part of the sceptical community myself until we saw patients in the clinic and understood how strikingly similar the features are,"" he said. One of those sufferers is Olana Tansley-Hancock, a 29-year-old from Ashford in Kent. She said she had started eating meals in her bedroom when she was eight because of the noises her family made while eating. She described misophonia as ""a feeling of wanting to punch people in the face when I heard the noise of them eating - and anyone who knows me will say that doesn't sound like me"". She said: ""This research is a huge relief as it shows there is a physical basis for misophonia which should help others understand the condition. ""It also opens up the opportunity for better management."""

In a statement, his family said he had requested for his body to be left to Edinburgh University for research, followed by a private interment. The Old Etonian was first elected to Parliament in 1962 as MP for West Lothian, and served as a parliamentary aide to the cabinet minister and diarist Richard Crossman. He became MP for Linlithgow 21 years later and was named Father of the House - the longest continuously serving MP - in 2001. A fierce critic of British military involvement, he was suspended from the Commons several times, twice for accusing Margaret Thatcher of lying over the Falklands conflict. He also branded Tony Blair a war criminal over the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the announcement of Mr Dalyell's death on 26 January, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Very sad to hear of the death of former Labour MP, Tam Dalyell - a real giant of Scottish politics. My thoughts are with his family."" Jeremy Corbyn, who for many years was a fellow rebel alongside Mr Dalyell, said: ""Tam was a titan of parliamentary scrutiny, fearless in pursuit of the truth. From Iraq to the miners' strike, he doggedly fought to expose official wrongdoing and cover-ups.""

But about an hour after the US Coast Guard suspended its search, a volunteer fire team discovered a body about 300ft (91m) from his last-known location, which was at a depth of 220ft (67m). The Key Largo Fire Department has identified the body as Stewart's, but the coroner is yet to officially confirm the identity. On Facebook, Stewart's sister Alexandra said: ""Rob has been found, peacefully in the ocean. There are no words. ""We are grateful to everyone who helped search, and happy that Rob passed doing what he loved."" Stewart was working on a sequel to the Sharkwater documentary when he got into difficulty. The filmmaker and his dive partner had gone to retrieve an anchor at the time of his disappearance. His dive partner had collapsed after returning to the boat. Stewart had signalled that he was OK after getting back to the surface, but later went missing. More than £120,000 was raised to help look for Stewart. A GoFundMe page said he was ""scuba diving on the queen of nassau wreck, six miles off shore of Islamorada Florida, when he disappeared after surfacing"" on Tuesday. Mr Stewart, also a writer and conservationist, had argued in Sharkwater that the creatures were misunderstood."

A post-mortem examination revealed its intestines were completely blocked with the bags and other items of plastic, some with English writing on them. Vets from the University of Bergen said the bags would have blocked its digestive system, causing the animal - also known as a goose-beaked whale - considerable pain. :: Sky Ocean Rescue - how to get involved Several attempts had been made to direct it back out into the sea, but eventually it had to be shot. Dr Terje Lislevand, a zoologist at the university, told the Bergens Tidende newspaper the whale was emaciated, suggesting it had been unable to feed for some time. He told Sky News: ""It wasn't like it was in just part of the stomach. It filled up the whole space. ""I think the whale has been in pain. I don't think it's been comfortable to have this in the stomach. ""It's the explanation of why the animal acted so strange and stranded."" Cuvier's whales grow up to 22ft and feed on squid and fish. They do not normally range in Norwegian waters. Researchers believe it may have mistaken the plastic bags for squid. Sky has launched its Ocean Rescue campaign to raise awareness of the damage being caused to our marine environment worldwide by single use plastics. More than eight million tonnes of plastic is thrown away each year and washed out to sea and scientists estimate that there are more than 150 million tonnes of plastic waste in the ocean. By 2050, the amount of plastic in the sea is likely to weigh more than all the fish. Last week, Sky News filmed a post-mortem on a fulmar, a large seabird. Its stomach was full of plastic and almost certainly resulted in a catastrophic loss of appetite."
