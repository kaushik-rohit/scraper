2017-08-01,A lifeboat was scrambled to rescue a man stuck a mile out at sea as he tried to paddle against the current in a toy dinghy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/man-rescued-from-toy-dinghy-in-the-north-sea-off-redcar-coast-10969739,"The man, who the RNLI believe was in his 30s, was pulled to safety as he drifted in the North Sea off the coast of Redcar with his legs dangling over the edge of the blow-up craft. He was rescued on Monday evening near the Teesside wind farm and was not exactly kitted out for a day at sea - wearing shorts, a hoody and trainers. The RNLI said the Redcar inshore lifeboat escorted the man back to dry land where ""a coastguard team was waiting to give him sea safety advice"". Dave Cocks, lifeboat operations manager at Redcar RNLI said: ""This is a good example of the types of incident we repeatedly warn people about.'It was a reasonably pleasant evening but the wind and tide were a recipe for this to happen. ""We believe the man was in his 30s. He was dressed in only a hoodie and shorts. He was bigger than the dinghy so his feet were hanging over the edge.""If the alarm hadn't been raised there was every likelihood he'd have drifted out of sight of land and we could well have been bringing a dead body back."""
2017-08-01,The latest victim of the Grenfell fire disaster to be identified is believed to be one of the youngest to die in the blaze.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/toddler-jeremiah-deen-identified-as-latest-grenfell-victim-10970019,"Two-year-old Jeremiah Deen has been formally identified as one of the more than 80 people who died in the tower block, the Metropolitan Police said. His mother, 32-year-old Zainab Deen, was confirmed at an inquest in July to have also died. ""The Deen family regret to announce the death of their daughter Zainab Deen and their grandson Jeremiah Deen as a result of the fire at their Grenfell Tower residence in west London on 14 June 2017,"" the family said in a statement. ""We would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to all relatives and friends for their prayers, floral tributes and expression of condolences during this difficult time. ""Funeral arrangements will be announced later as plans are being made to lay mother and son to rest. ""'You spent a moment in our arms, but you will last a lifetime in our hearts'. RIP Zainab and Jeremiah."" Ms Deen was discovered on the 14th floor and her cause of death was given, subject to confirmation, as ""consistent with the effects of fire"". Police investigating the Grenfell disaster said last week that there are grounds to suspect corporate manslaughter may have been committed. The Government has ordered an independent review into building regulations after 82 tower blocks failed new fire safety checks. Authorities have been criticised for not providing enough support for children affected by the disaster."
2017-08-01,"The AA's board says  it has removed its executive chairman for ""gross misconduct"" and revealed its full-year performance will miss market expectations.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/aa-boss-bob-mackenzie-removed-for-gross-misconduct-10970029,"In a statement to the City the motoring services group said Bob MacKenzie had left the company with immediate effect though it refused to explain why, except to say it was a ""personal conduct-related matter"". The Times later quoted a relative as saying the 64-year old had actually resigned on Tuesday morning and been admitted to hospital with an ""extremely distressing mental health issue."" Peter MacKenzie, one of his three sons, added that his father as ""very unwell"". The AA did not confirm or deny that his departure was linked to alleged activity at the company but it did add there was no connection with its warning, released separately, of a hit to annual profit expectations. It reported that ""significant spikes in demand"" in June and July meant it had not had enough roadside patrols in place to help drivers. The AA also pointed to a negative impact from two other issues including an earlier-than-expected bill related to a profit-sharing arrangement. It said the cumulative effect of the costs would mean its full-year performance expectations falling in line with those of the previous financial year, when trading profits stood at £403m. Analysts had expected to see trading profits of around £413m in 2017/18 - the first growth under a group transformation plan. Shares in the FTSE 250 firm fell by up to 18%, closing 14% lower. The AA had previously announced that the group was to split the executive chairman role as part of efforts to ensure best practice in corporate governance after he led the company to its flotation in June 2014. He will be succeeded by non-executive chairman John Leach while fellow AA director Simon Breakwell, the founder of Expedia, was named acting chief executive."

The 12-year-old girl was pronounced dead on arrival at North Devon District Hospital. Her brother was taken to hospital by air ambulance but also died a short while later, police said. The mother, 43, died at the scene. The family are understood to have been holidaying in Devon and the woman's husband - the twins' stepfather - and her other son, 14, were travelling in the car ahead. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said the mother and children were from the Milton Keynes area and had been travelling in a separate vehicle to her husband and 14-year-old son. The spokesman said the husband's car was not ""directly involved"" in the collision. It is understood the biological father of the children has been informed of their deaths.Police are still investigating the cause of the collision."
2017-08-01,British Gas owner Centrica has announced it will be putting up its electricity prices within weeks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/at-a-glance-how-the-british-gas-price-hike-will-affect-you-10969625,"We take a look at how it will affect customers: :: How much more am I likely to pay? The cost of electricity will rise by 12.5% from the 15 September this year. Gas prices will stay the same - but the hefty hike in the cost of power means the average household on a dual fuel tariff will see their bills go up 7.3%, or around £76. That will bring the average annual bill for a British Gas dual fuel customer to £1,120. :: Why is British Gas owner Centrica hiking bills? According to British Gas, the price rise is needed to offset the fact that delivering electricity to homes is getting more expensive. While wholesale prices - the amount British Gas itself pays for power before passing it on to customers - have largely fallen since the start of the year, the company says that rises in the cost of transmitting that electricity mean that they are currently selling power at a loss. British Gas also points to increases in the cost of implementing ""energy policy""; that is, requirements set by the Government regarding the move to renewable energies and environmental impact. :: Is Centrica the only company increasing its bills? At the moment, yes. But British Gas is the only one of the ""Big Six"" energy firms to have held off raising prices over the past winter. British Gas has had a price freeze in place since December of last year, while SSE, E.ON, Scottish Power, EDF and npower have all hiked customers' bills since January. A few of the smaller suppliers have also increased tariffs - First Utility raised bills 9.7% in April and Co-op Energy announced 5% increase in April. :: I have a British Gas pre-payment meter, will I be affected? No - the price rise won't be applied to those customers who pay for their electricity using a pre-payment meter. :: I don't think I can afford this price rise - what do I do? British Gas says it will be offering help to 200,000 of their most vulnerable customers, to alleviate the difficulties they'll face following the price hike. Anyone who gets their energy from British Gas and already qualifies for the Warm Home Discount will automatically have their account credited with £76 - the amount an average dual fuel bill will increase by over the next year because of the price rise. This should mean that, for most people who receive the discount, the hike will have no effect on how much they have to pay."
2017-08-01,A group of priests have been turned away from a pub – because staff thought they were on a stag do. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/priests-turned-away-from-pub-in-stag-do-misunderstanding-10970269,"The seven seminarians had popped to the City Arms in Cardiff on Saturday night to celebrate the ordination of colleague Father Peter McLaren. But when they arrived dressed in the clerical collar, the doorman assumed they were a group of revellers in fancy dress and turned them away. It was only when the manager realised their outfits were genuine that the men were let in - to applause from other punters and a round of free drinks on the house. One of the group, Father Michael Doyle, said similar misunderstandings were not uncommon, and that the group had been asked if they were on a stag do only the weekend before. ""The doorman basically said something along the lines of 'sorry gents, we have a policy of no fancy dress and no stag dos',"" Fr Doyle said, adding that the situation was ""just gold"". Matt Morgan, the assistant manager at the City Arms, said the group were ""great sports and saw the funny side of the situation"". He said the pub tends to turn away stag parties as they ""generally have a quieter crowd of drinkers"". The group, which included trainee priests, continued drinking in the pub and were told they would be ""welcome back any time"". Reverend Robert James was even delighted to discover an ale sharing his name at the bar - and bought a pint of Brains Rev James for the barman. The Archbishop of Cardiff, George Stack, noted that Rev James did ""not have any shares"" in the brand. He said it was ""wonderful"" that the men were celebrating by having a good time in Cardiff, ""which of course they are allowed to have"". The City Arms is also a favourite pub of the Archbishop, Fr Doyle added."

The 51-year-old suspect, who lived in the area at the time of the teenager's disappearance, is being questioned in custody. Charlene's body has never been found and the case has become Lancashire Police's largest and longest investigation. Two men were arrested and tried on suspicion of Charlene's murder in 2007, with prosecutors claiming Charlene's body was chopped up and had ""gone into kebabs"". The men, who owned a takeaway, were given more than £230,000 of compensation after a 2008 retrial collapsed with the prosecution offering no evidence. Police reopened the investigation into her death in 2013, the 10th anniversary of when she was last seen alive. Several arrests were made by investigators last year for historical sex offences, but they are said to not be directly related to as Charlene's disappearance. A £100,000 reward remains on offer for information leading to the conviction of Charlene's killer or killers. Anyone with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

2017-08-01,Twenty-one EU countries have sent in bids to host the two EU agencies that have to be relocated from London after Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-spoils-whos-bidding-to-host-eu-agencies-relocating-from-london-10969822,"The high number of bids - coming from all but six of the 27-post Brexit EU member states - sets the stage for a tough battle for the prized bodies, which together employ some 1,000 highly skilled workers. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) are currently based in London's Canary Wharf. The Irish Government has entered bids for both agencies, along with Germany, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium. Nineteen cities are bidding for EMA, which has nearly 900 staff and acts as a one-stop-shop for approving and monitoring the safety of drugs across Europe. Milan, Copenhagen, Athens, Amsterdam and Barcelona are among the candidates to host the agency, with Milan seen as a possible front-runner. Eight cities have applied for EBA, which employs 160 people and writes and coordinates banking rules for the bloc. Frankfurt, Paris, Luxembourg and Prague are among those bidding for it, with the German city viewed as a favourite as it already hosts the European Central Bank and the EU insurance agency. Vienna, Warsaw, Dublin and Brussels submitted applications to host both agencies. Only Hungary, Slovenia, Cyprus and the three Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia decided not to enter the competition. The figures were released by the Council of the European Union after bidding for the agencies finished at midnight on Monday. In the past, races for such agencies became heated, but EU diplomats have said they are keen to avoid disrupting the unity the bloc has found over Brexit. The decision is made by November."
2017-08-01,The police watchdog has started an investigation into evidence given by officers following the death of one of their colleagues.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/police-watchdog-to-reinvestigate-pcs-shooting-death-10969687,"The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it was looking into a number of allegations relating to the death of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) constable Ian Terry. PC Terry was fatally shot during a GMP training exercise in June 2008. An IPCC investigation which ended in December 2009 looked at the circumstances of the incident. It found evidence that there was a case to answer for gross misconduct involving three GMP officers. Two officers were subsequently found guilty of gross misconduct, while the third had retired from the force. In 2013, GMP pleaded guilty to a criminal charge related to the death of the officer. The chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, Peter Fahy, admitted ""systemic failure"" by the police in Manchester at Liverpool Crown Court. The case was brought by the Health and Safety Executive after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to press charges. An inquest in March 2010 found that PC Terry was unlawfully killed. The IPCC said the new investigation ""concerns allegations regarding officers at GMP in respect of their actions, and the evidence they provided, following PC Terry's death"". The watchdog does not say what led it to open the new investigation. ""Some of the allegations are still being assessed at this time to determine whether or not they warrant investigation,"" it added in a statement. ""However, the IPCC has commenced an investigation looking at evidence given by a number of officers to the IPCC, to the inquest after PC Terry's death, and to the subsequent Health and Safety Executive (HSE) crown court trial."" PC Terry's family has been notified of the new IPCC investigation and is to be given regular updates as the case progresses."
2017-08-01,The refreshing thing about the recent encryption debate is how readily politicians cheerfully admit that their plans have no basis in reality.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/im-a-real-person-and-i-think-end-to-end-encryption-is-good-10970144,"Take Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian Prime Minister. Last month he proposed legislation that would force internet companies to remove end-to-end encryption, saying: ""The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia."" Mathematicians may disagree. The Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, does not. Writing in the Telegraph, she acknowledges the argument that it's impossible for a system to be end-to-end encrypted and give authorities access to it. If they do get access, someone else, like a hacker, might too, that argument goes. She writes: ""That might be true in theory. But the reality is different."" Once again: the theory is mathematics and it very much applies to reality. :: Rudd to meet tech firms over extremist content If you enjoy a feeling of deja vu, the arguments around encryption are good value. We've been arguing about back doors since Snowden in 2013. But you can glean some weak signs of how the debate might move forward - at least from the Home Secretary's side. Here's the new bit: real people. Rudd writes that ""real people often prefer ease of use and a multitude of features to perfect, unbreakable security"". That may be the case. But why not have both, if that's what's already on offer from WhatsApp and iMessage? It's also worth asking who Amber Rudd thinks ""real people"" are. I'm a real person, I think, and I believe end-to-end encryption is good. Rudd's use of the term quietly suggests that anyone who advocates for end-to-end encryption isn't a real person. Possibly, they're on the side of those terrorists and serious criminals. But real people care about security. Or perhaps it's better put like this: real people may not care about security, but they expect it. Security is not why we choose WhatsApp or iMessage, but it's part of the package. You might, for example, choose a bank account for all sorts of different reasons, like interest rates or perks. But you'd probably assume they have a fairly solid vault. As Silkie Carlo, policy officer at Liberty, says: ""Real people don't want to be hacked. Real people care about their privacy, they care about their civil liberties"". :: Is Rudd's tech ambition California Dreaming? When many NHS hospitals were taken offline thanks to a hacking technique stolen from the NSA, we all asked why they weren't secure. Imagine the same happening to more than a billion WhatsApp users. Hackers - whether solo or backed by nation states like Russia - will try and find the keys to our communications which government is currently demanding. There's a reason after all that MPs use WhatsApp for their secret communications. This is all frustrating because there were signs the groundhog day debate of encryption might be moving forward. Rudd writes that ""there are options"" and this might have been. The chief executive of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, told me earlier this year that there could be a ""middle ground"" on encryption. Facebook Messenger, for example, offers a form of encryption that can be turned off and on. But that's not end-to-end encryption. For the Home Secretary to suggest, yet again, that end-to-end encryption should be available to police shows she's not making a technical argument, but a political one."
2017-08-01,Apple appears to have soothed investor concerns over the release of its 10th anniversary iPhone range while reporting a leap in smartphone sales.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/apple-iphone-sales-jump-ahead-of-new-10th-anniversary-range-10970281,"The world's most-valuable listed company's third quarter results showed it sold just over 41 million of the smartphones worldwide - bucking the usual trend of a fall in the three months to July in what is traditionally its weakest period in terms of earnings. It was seen as particularly impressive given the fact its new iPhone 8 and 7S models are expected to be released in September, despite doubts that weak availability of key chips could hit the launch. The issue has been the talk of the tech sector - with speculation raising fears that Apple could be forced to stagger the sale of iPhone 8 handsets to give it time to gather enough flash storage chips. But investors took heart from Apple's own revenue forecasts for the current fourth quarter - when the new phones are due to be released - which showed a range of between $49bn and $52bn. Such a performance would represent a leap of up to 11% on the same period last year. Shares rose more than 6% in after-hours trading to new record highs, suggesting the company did not foresee any potential stumbling blocks. The company does not tend to comment on future releases. It is rumoured the next generation phone will include wireless charging capability and an OLED curved display. Apple said revenue in the third quarter came in 7% up at $45.4bn - driven largely by the iPhone sales increase of 1.6%. Service revenue, which includes Apple's app store sales, jumped 22% while iPad and Mac computer revenue also rose. Apple said it sold 11.4 million iPads in the quarter, a 15% increase on the same period last year. The company credited its efforts to sell more to schools. However, greater China sales fell 10% as Apple battled tighter regulation and stronger competition. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said the results were ""decidedly rosier"" than those of recent quarters. ""Revenue growth has strengthened, even in mature markets like North America. ""Alongside this, margin improvements have helped to boost net income by almost 12% over the prior year. ""In our view, this is a very solid performance, especially so at this point in the cycle when consumers are awaiting the release of the next generation of product."""
2017-08-01,"Best known as the drug that killed pop star Prince, fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and up to 100 times more powerful than morphine.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/sixty-deaths-linked-to-fentanyl-drug-in-uk-10969840,"While it has been used in hospitals for decades as pain relief medication, an illegal version of the drug has caused so many deaths in the US in recent years that it has been described as a ""weapon of mass destruction"". But it is also becoming a widespread problem on the streets of Britain, claiming the lives of drug users unaware of its potency. The opioid was first made in 1960 by Belgian doctor Paul Janssen and introduced in hospitals as an intravenous anaesthetic. In the mid-1990s it became available as a patch for patients being given palliative care, before a powdered version of the pain reliever began to be pushed as a low-cost recreational drug. Users experience a state of euphoria and relaxation, factors which make it highly addictive. Its potency also means that just a few grains of the white powder can kill a user before they have even finished injecting it. Last November, 18-year-old Briton Robert Fraser died after unintentionally overdosing on the drug. Robert's mother Michelle told Sky News: ""It shouldn't be on the streets, this sort of stuff. ""These days there is too much and its too easily accessible for teenagers especially as we have mobile phones and the internet. ""It's kids giving it to kids a lot of the time - they don't know what they are giving."" According to the US government's Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), fentanyl is being mass-produced in illegal labs in China before being sold wholesale to Mexican cartels. It is then pushed on to streets in America through existing opiate trafficking networks. Supplies of the drug can be stretched much further than heroin - using cutting agents a kilo can be turned into 25kg. It is for this reason that fentanyl is regularly used to bulk out supplies of heroin, a method which has proved fatal for heroin addicts unaware they were taking fatal dosages of another drug. As one addict in the US told Sky News, fentanyl is ""heaven for the dealers but hell for the users"". In April, the National Crime Agency said the drug was believed to have been behind a number of deaths in Yorkshire, Humber and Cleveland. It came as West Midlands Police raided an illicit drugs laboratory suspected of producing the drug. The NCA warned the laboratory's fentanyl could have been present in drugs across the country. The potency of fentanyl has caused serious problems for US police attempting to crack down on the supply of the drug. Last year, the DEA released a video in which two New Jersey detectives described how they fell seriously ill after inhaling the substance while closing an evidence bag. Eric Price said he lost colour and thought he was dying as his body started ""shutting down"". His partner, Dan Kallen, said the drug made him severely disorientated and gave him ""the most bizarre feeling that I never want to feel again"". The officers were not the last to suffer the consequences of coming into contact with the highly potent drug. In May, an officer from East Liverpool in Ohio collapsed and was taken to hospital after handling the opioid. Chris Green had worn gloves when searching the car of a suspected drug dealer, but later returned to his police station with white powder on his shirt. He instinctively brushed the substance off with his bare hand and, within a few minutes, collapsed. Mr Green was revived with four doses of opioid antidote Narcan. Just a fortnight later, another police officer in Pennsylvania required hospital treatment after accidentally inhaling the substance in identical circumstances."
2017-08-01,"Voters at the last General Election saw Labour as the party that could deliver a ""soft Brexit"" and maintain close ties to the EU, a new study shows.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-seen-as-soft-brexit-party-at-general-election-study-finds-10969990,"Academics from the British Election Study (BES) team looked at how Remain and Leave voters at the 2016 Brexit referendum cast ballots in last month's snap election. They found that Labour won over ""large numbers"" of Remain backers from the Conservatives, the Green Party and Liberal Democrats. In all, more than 50% of all voters who backed Remain at the 2016 EU referendum gave their support to Jeremy Corbyn's party. This compared with 25% for the Tories and 15% for the pro-EU Lib Dems, despite the fact that Tim Farron had promised a second referendum once the terms of the Brexit deal are clear. Professor Ed Fieldhouse and Chris Prosser, members of the BES team from the University of Manchester, wrote: ""Despite an ambiguous position on the single market, Labour was seen as the best bet for those wanting to keep closer ties with our European neighbours."" Since the election, confusion inside the Labour Party has continued. Mr Corbyn has said Britain would leave the single market while shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and other leading party figures insist all options are on the table. The research also showed how Mr Corbyn outperformed Theresa May during the campaign. Mrs May lost her Conservative majority in the election, a humiliating result for a leader who had demanded a strong mandate from the country to negotiate Brexit and who had a double-digit lead in the polls at the start of the campaign. The BES study is based on a survey of more than 31,000 people conducted by YouGov between 9 June and 23 June. The study found a ""striking correlation between wanting to control immigration and voting Tory on one hand, and wanting access to the single market and voting Labour or Lib Dem on the other"". It said the Conservatives lead Labour by more than 40 percentage points amongst voters who wanted full control of immigration, while Labour had a similar lead among voters wanting complete access to the single market. ""The Tories were the party of hard Brexit whilst Labour was the party of soft Brexit,"" the professors said. In the absence of Nigel Farage, much of the UKIP vote went to the Conservatives, who adopted a hard line on Brexit, the study found. Brexit was the dominant issue of the election for more than one in three of the respondents - well ahead of the NHS or the economy. In separate polling data, YouGov asked more than 2,000 Leave voters if they would consider significant damage to the economy a price worth paying for Brexit - 61% answered yes, 20% no and 19% don't know. It also asked 2,200 Remain voters if significant damage to the economy was a price worth paying to stay in the EU - 34% replied yes, 38% no and 27% said they did not know."
2017-08-01,Six theme park rides in the UK similar to the one that caused the death of a man in Ohio at the weekend have been taken out of use.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/six-uk-rides-shut-down-after-ohio-state-fair-death-10969827,"The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has issued an Enforcement Notice to the operators of five of the rides, called the KMG Afterburner. All five have been ordered to be keep their machines out of use until the notices have been complied with. The operator of the other ride took the decision to take it out of use and has agreed to keep it dormant until action has been taken over the other five. Tyler Jarrell, an 18-year-old high school student, died and seven others were injured after passengers were hurled from the Fire Ball ride, on the opening day of the Ohio State Fair. A graphic video circulated on Twitter showed the ride swinging from side to side before parts of it appeared to break off, hurling passengers through the air. It left three of the injured in a critical condition. The Fire Ball was the name of the KMG Afterburner ride used at the fair. The HSE said in a statement the five UK rides subject to enforcement notices were at: A HSE spokesperson said: ""HSE is aware of the tragic accident involving the KMG Afterburner (themed as Fire Ball) machine in Ohio on 26 July. ""There are six machines of this version operating in UK which were all thoroughly inspected within the last 12 months in line with agreed procedures. ""There is no verified information regarding the immediate cause of the US accident. Following the incident, HSE initiated a re-inspection of these machines. ""As a result, on Friday 28 July an Enforcement Notice was served on five of the machines, which are now to be taken out of use until the notices have been complied with. ""The sixth, at Lightwater Valley in North Yorkshire, was immediately taken out of use following the incident in Ohio. ""This was a decision taken independently by the operator. Lightwater Valley has agreed to keep this machine out of use until the other five notices have been complied with. ""HSE will ensure operators are kept abreast of information as it arrives and will take such action as is necessary to ensure the rides are inspected and tested as necessary to ensure safety."" The HSE stressed that none of the theme parks had been told to close. It is understood that KMG, a Dutch fairground attraction manufacturer, has sent a letter to operators of all similar machines in Great Britain. HSE said some of the operators of unaffected machines may have closed rides as a precaution. A spokesman for Lightwater Valley told the Teeside Gazette: ""While there are fundamental and significant differences between our ride and the one involved in this terrible incident we entirely support the Health and Safety Executive's decision to not operate these types of ride in Great Britain until all the facts are known and a comprehensive investigation has taken place."" A spokesman for Brean Theme Park told the Devon Live website: ""Safety is our top priority and we stopped the ride on the day of the accident. It will be stopped until we hear from the manufacturers and the powers that be."" Coney Fair owner Pat Evans told Wales Online: ""Our actions were pre-emptive and done entirely in the interests of public safety which, at all times, is our paramount priority. Manning's Amusements said: ""The safety of our customers is, of course, of paramount importance to us.

During the summer months, people often get into danger when lilos drift too far out to sea, some get stuck in riptides and ""tombstoning"", where people jump from cliffs or sea walls into the sea below. The RNLI is urging anyone who sees someone fall into open water to call the emergency services straight away, although latest figures suggest that only a fifth of the population would actually do so. Last year saw 31 coastal deaths in the UK in the month of August, which is up 55% on the year before. Five of those deaths were at Camber Sands in East Sussex, where a group of friends got into difficulty. An inquest heard that Ken Saththiyanathan, 18, his brother Kobi, 22, and their friends Nitharsan Ravi, 22, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23 and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, were competent swimmers, but there were hidden dangers below the water's surface. An RNLI coastal safety manager told Sky News: ""With summer holidays upon us and hopefully some hot weather, our fantastic beaches are naturally a draw for many people - but sadly this also means more people tragically losing their lives or getting into serious danger at the coast. ""The drownings that happened last August go to show how quickly a day of fun at the beach can turn into tragedy, so we are calling on the public to help us save lives this summer."" The RNLI station at Weston-super-Mare is one of the busiest in the country. Last year the team had 56 callouts and saved 13 lives. Experts there said people are often unaware that there could sometimes be thick mud on beaches, which could trap people when the tides turned quickly. Although temperatures during the summer months can be warm, the sea in Britain isn't usually higher than 15C, which is cold enough to trigger cold water shock. If that happens, the warning is to fight your instincts. Rather than trying to swim hard or trash about, you should try and float for just over a minute to catch your breath, before swimming to safety or calling for help. Anyone planning a trip to the beach is advised to choose one with lifeguards and to swim between the red and yellow flags."
2017-08-01,More than three million British Gas customers will see their electricity bills go up by 12.5% from 15 September.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170801231709/http://news.sky.com/story/british-gas-to-put-up-electricity-bills-by-125-owner-centrica-says-10969486,"Energy giant Centrica, which owns British Gas, confirmed the end of its long-standing price freeze after it mistakenly published an incomplete statement about the price hike on its website on Monday. It means the average annual dual fuel bill for a typical household on a standard tariff will rise by £76 to £1,120 - an increase of 7.3%. The company said gas prices would not be going up. British Gas said the increase for electricity was its first since November 2013 and that it would give a £76 credit to more than 200,000 vulnerable customers to protect them. Pre-payment meter customers are not affected by the price hike. Research suggests that British Gas should be cutting bills, not putting them up, as the wholesale cost of energy has been falling. Analysis of energy regulator Ofgem's supplier cost index by collective switching site The Big Deal shows that since a peak in December 2016, the costs for energy companies have fallen by 9%. But British Gas chief executive Mark Hodges asserted ""wholesale prices during the last 12 months have not gone down"" and that the price hike was down to ""cost pressures"". He told Sky News: ""We haven't taken this decision lightly. We realise that 3.1 million people are affected. But we have in the end had to respond, like many of our competitors, to the underlying increases we have seen in electricity. ""Our costs have gone up over the past few years by around 16%, so in the end, despite our own efforts to try and keep our costs under control, our efforts to improve our service, we have just had to make this difficult decision."" Mr Hodges would not be drawn on whether the firm expected to lose customers over the price increase. ""Customers do have choice,"" he said. ""They can move to many other companies... and that puts the pressure on us, and that is why we don't make decisions like today's decision lightly. ""We are very thoughtful about the impact on our customers, and on the number of customers that we are able to serve."" Asked whether customers could see their prices go down in the future, he replied: ""We always want to keep our prices as low as possible... so any opportunity we have to either reduce our own costs, or if the costs that we incur that we don't control go down, of course we would consider passing that on as quickly as we can to our customers."" Rising energy bills are squeezing households as inflation also bites through the increasing cost of food shopping - while at the same time latest figures show wage growth has been slowing. @skysarahjane I haven't had a pay rise in 4 years!

One person tweeted: ""like to know the British Gas breakdown of 'cost of delivery' if infrastructure investment should be continually borne by users. Greedy."" Details of the change in tariff came as Centrica revealed it lost 377,000 UK customer accounts in the first half of 2017. The group's pre-tax profits dropped by 7% to £639m in the six months to 30 June, compared with £688m for the same period last year. British Gas is the last of the 'big six' energy firms to increase prices. EDF hiked bills for the second time this year in April, putting a typical household's gas and electricity costs for the year up by 8.5%, or £91. Rival SSE put up standard bills by 6.9%, while E.On set out an 8.8% hike, both from the end of April. There have also been rises of 9.8% from npower and 8% from ScottishPower, which took effect in March, while British Gas bucked the trend with a price freeze until August."

While most of these instances involved compliant handcuffing and ground restraints, they also saw officers use firearms, shields and police dogs. Firearms were aimed at suspects 281 times, equating to 21 times a week or three times a day. Shots were fired during two incidents - one of which is likely to have been the shootings of London Bridge terror attackers Khuram Shazad Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba. In another case, an attenuating energy projectile - also known as a plastic baton round - was fired by an officer. The figures also reveal: :: In 24 incidents which required the use of police dogs, suspects were bitten 17 times:: Offenders were sprayed with chemical irritant CS gas 68 times:: Officers were injured on 643 occasions - 10 severely:: More than half of incidents which required force involved male suspects aged 18-34:: Tasers were fired 100 times Met commander Matt Twist said the figures show the force's officers ""face the most dangerous situations every day"". ""It is important we give them the right training and equipment to do the job,"" he said. ""Use of force techniques are there to stop violence and danger, protecting not only the officer making an arrest but also the public at the scene, and the person being arrested."" The release of the data comes a week after the death of a young black man following a police pursuit in east London. The death of Rashan Charles, 20, sparked violent protests during which bottles and fireworks were thrown at police."

The revival of the supermarket brand comes more than 13 years after Bradford-based supermarket giant Morrisons acquired Safeway in March 2004 in a £3bn deal. Jonathan Miller, chief executive of McColl's, said the tie-up was ""transformational"" for the company and would prove to be a ""defining moment"" after boosting its estate by snapping up 298 Co-op stores. He said: ""In McColl's, Morrisons gain a long-term partner of significant scale with a growing neighbourhood convenience estate, and in Morrisons we gain access to their best-in-class sourcing and manufacturing capabilities."" Morrisons chief executive David Potts said: ""We are also pleased to be reviving the Safeway brand which we know customers will enjoy."" He added: ""Wholesale supply will help make us a broader, stronger business."" McColl's announced last month that its pre-tax profits almost halved from £8.2m to £4.5m in the first half of the year after the firm factored in the cost of the Co-op deal. Revenue rose 7.6% to almost £505m in the first six months to 28 May, with like-for-like sales growing 0.2%. In March, Morrisons reported a return to annual sales growth for the first time in five years, with profits up 50%. Pre-tax profit for the year to 29 January came in at £325m, on the back of a 1.7% increase in comparable sales. Shares in Morrisons rose more than 1% in early trading on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday."

For the second quarter of 2017, 3,565 people called the RAC to report broken suspension springs, damaged shock absorbers or distorted wheels - issues often caused by poor road surfaces. There were 2,725 over the same period in 2016. Earlier this year, the Local Government Association (LGA) warned that a shortfall in funding would mean many councils struggling to fund social care would need to divert cash earmarked for potholes and other services. The RAC's pothole index, based on a 12-month rolling average of breakdowns, indicates that road quality is getting worse after five quarters of improvement. RAC chief engineer David Bizley said a spell of extreme weather could cause surfaces to deteriorate further. He said: ""The most worrying aspect, however, is the fact that this year's weather has been so much milder and drier than in the equivalent six months last year and, for this reason, we should have expected the numbers for the second quarter to be lower. ""We fear it would only take a spell of very cold or wet weather for the improvements of the last year or two to evaporate and for the nation to find itself in a situation when we would once again be seeking emergency funding from Government to address the worst affected roads."" Local authorities in England and Wales need over £12bn to bring roads up to scratch, according to the annual road maintenance survey from the Ashphalt Industry Alliance. That is several times the amount councils spend annually on highways and transport, which was £4.4bn in England last year. The Department for Transport announced last month that councils would have access to a multi-billion-pound fund to improve or replace their most important A-roads. In 2016, Government figures showed that England had 246,500 miles of public roads, of which only 31,400 miles were motorway or A-roads. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Nationally, we are providing councils more than £6bn over six years to maintain roads and repair potholes. ""On top of this, we announced last autumn an additional £1.1bn to upgrade and repair roads for communities across England. ""From 2020, we will also have a dedicated share from the National Road Fund to improve and maintain our major roads."""

However, when engineers were unable to fix the problem the following day, the airline said that the plane night curfew rule - put in place to protect the area's endangered turtles - meant that no replacement flight could be sent that night. While around a quarter of passengers were able to hitch a lift on alternative flights the following day, according to the airline, about 135 people were left stranded in the capital Zakynthos until Tuesday. EasyJet apologised for the delay, saying: ""Unfortunately, due to the night curfew rule at the airport, we were unable to get the replacement aircraft into the airport."" A number of passengers affected by the disruption voiced their irritation on Twitter, saying that EasyJet staff and information about the delay were both hard to come by while they were stuck on the island. The curfew rules, to safeguard the island's Loggerhead turtles from light and noise, reflect the importance of the endangered species to the island's tourist industry. The island's Bay of Laganas is one of the most important breeding grounds for the turtles, which like to dig their nests in the shallow dunes. However, Greece has faced criticism in the past, with the European Court of Justice ruling that it was not doing enough to protect its endangered turtle population in 2002. EasyJet has confirmed that passengers affected by the delays will be entitled to compensation."

The Airbus A320 had 121 passengers and six crew on board, who broke out into applause as the plane came to a halt. Mr Akopov, who was given the Ukrainian Order for Courage in his home country, told local media: ""I have been flying for 30 years. ""Did you see the plane landing? Was it okay? The passengers are alive. It is normal. This is our professional reliability. ""Our locator did not show this weather disaster, this is why it happened. ""It was hard, but the main thing is that people are alive."" The storm damaged the plane's nose and disabled the aircraft's autopilot. Heavy rain and stormy weather has battered Istanbul in recent weeks, causing travel disruption after train stations and roads were flooded.

Beds will be moved to other wards within the hospital on Friday, but office staff and the ground-floor outpatient clinic will remain at the current site. External cladding is thought to have contributed to the spread of the fire at Grenfell Tower, which led to the deaths of at least 80 people. :: Grenfell: 82 tower blocks fail new fire safety checks Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust commissioned a review of fire safety at its four main buildings following the fire in June. A report by fire safety consultancy Trenton Fire, which carried out the review, found the trauma unit had ""serious and embedded fire safety issues"" and identified problems with the ""inadequate"" fire alarm system, missing cavity barriers and a flammable cladding system. This combination of factors was not sufficient to stop a fire spreading, and cladding panels removed for inspection indicated a ""deviation from guidance"", the report said. The consultants warned that the fire service could issue a prohibition notice if works were not immediately carried out on the building, which was only built in 2002. Dr Bruno Holthof, chief executive of the hospital trust, said: ""Our highest priority is the patients in our care and our staff who are dedicated in their care for those patients.

The 'weapon of mass destruction' The drug, which killed the singer Prince, is around 50 times more potent than heroin and up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. However, a chemical adaptation of the synthetic drug called carfentanyl - an elephant tranquilliser - can be up to 10,000 times stronger than street heroin. Fentanyl - and other adaptations of the opioid - is often mixed with heroin and other class A drugs to bulk out supplies. Doses can then prove fatal, with dealers accused by the NCA of playing ""Russian roulette"" with the lives of users. The agency's deputy director, Ian Cruxton, has said he believes the synthetic drug is being both supplied in and exported from the UK. Mr Cruxton said: ""We believe the illicit supply from Chinese manufacturers and distributors constitutes a prime source for both synthetic opioids and the precursor chemicals used to manufacture them."" He added: ""We believe there have been at least 60 deaths to date where we can link fentanyl and its analogues to the deaths of individuals from suspected drug overdoses. ""But it's not a precise science - often these people have a number of different drugs in their body at the post mortem stage."" Earlier this year, a spate of fentanyl-related deaths in the North of England kick-started an urgent investigation by police. Officers recently carried out a number of raids, with four people arrested in Leeds and Gwent. Police are warning anyone who is aware of a supplier of fentanyl - which often sold on the dark web - to get in touch with authorities. Prince's overdose on the drug in 2016 brought fentanyl to international attention. Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt said: ""Police raised the alarm for the first time in April when - after years of seeing evidence of fentanyl being used to cut drugs, particularly heroin, in the US and Canada and the subsequent deaths and overdoses - they found the first evidence of its use in the UK."" He added: ""It's not exactly a new drug - it has been used legitimately for many years in the medical world as a very heavy duty painkiller and in palliative care."""

EU countries have to carry out more stringent checks on passengers who are entering or leaving the Schengen area, which covers most of mainland Europe and allows passport-free movement.The checks become mandatory in October, but a lot of airports have already started carrying them out. The decision to bring them in was made following the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels. :: Britons face airport delays due to new EU security rules :: How bad are the delays? Some people have been waiting from two to four hours in queues, according to Airlines For Europe, a group which represents carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways' parent company IAG It says flight delays have increased by 300% compared to last year. :: What is actually happening? Each traveller entering or leaving a Schengen area country is being checked against different databases to make sure they do not pose a security threat.The checks are said to take around two minutes per passenger. :: Who is affected? People travelling between a non-Schengen state, for example any country outside Europe - as well as the UK and Ireland (which opted out of the agreement), and any EU member state that is part of the group. That includes popular holiday destinations such as Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Belgium and Holland. :: I'm going on holiday, what should I do? Check with your airline and factor extra queuing time into your travel arrangements. :: Why is it so bad now? A lot of people are going on their summer holidays, making airports busier in general, and the enhanced checks mean it is taking longer to get through the queues. There is also said to be inadequate levels of staffing to ensure the checks get done quickly. :: What is being done about it? Travel organisations and lobby groups have urged the Government to pressure EU states to provide more staff to get passengers through security as fast as possible. :: How long will all this last? The new checking system isn't fully rolled out yet and is meant to be implemented by October, so the problem could drag on. Although, it may also ease as the summer rush subsides."

Cornwall in southwest England, some 700 miles south of Shetland, had 153.5 hours. It is only the eighth time since records began in 1929 it has happened. The statistics show the UK as a whole had nearly a quarter more rain than normal in July. Most regions have had an average amount of sunshine, but Scotland and Northern Ireland have enjoyed more than normal. Temperatures across the UK were also described as ""unremarkable"" with only the Isle of Wight (0.8C warmer than average) and East Lothian (0.8C cooler than average) standing out. June saw temperatures reaching near record levels with the mercury soaring past 30C on five consecutive days, making it hotter than much of Mediterranean Europe. There had been hopes 2017 would see a repeat of the long hot summer of 1976, with a maximum temperature of 34.5C nearly equalling that year's hottest June day. But the end of the hot spell was accompanied by thunderstorms, with temperatures falling soon after the start of July. Sky weather presenter Kirsty McCabe said that while the sun may have shined on Shetland during the last month, its good fortune may not last. She said: ""While Cornwall normally gets more summer sunshine than Shetland, it's worth noting that thanks to its northerly latitude Shetland does have more available hours of daylight during the summer months. ""This year the Land of the Midnight Sun got particularly lucky with sunny weather, while Cornwall was rather cloudy and dull. ""With less than a month of summer left, will the weather improve? The long-range forecast indicates the last two weeks of August should see things settle down as the jet stream pushes north. ""The southeast is likely to get the best of any sunshine, with Atlantic weather fronts bringing wet and windy spells to the northwest. ""But pinning down details beyond a week ahead is very difficult and it's best to keep up to date with the latest forecast."""

But new statistics show a dramatic rise in the number dying from two misused prescription drugs. The number of people dying from taking pregabalin, which is prescribed to treat seizures and anxiety, has risen by 2,775% since 2012 - to 111. And the number dying from using gabapentin, used to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain, rose 737%, to 59, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Overall, the rate of drug deaths among the general population in England and Wales rose from 65.1 per million in 2015 to 65.8 per million in 2016. The ONS said the annual rise was statistically not significant, but when compared to the figure for 2012, the number of people being poisoned to death by drugs overall has risen 44%. The small rise overall in the last year is largely attributable to the number of deaths caused by heroin or morphine - the biggest killers - remaining relatively stable, rising from 1,201 to 1,209. The ONS says the figures relate to all deaths which occur as a result of drug poisonings: those involving prescription and non-prescription drugs and those that involve suicide and accidents from drug misuse or dependence. But the statistics do not include deaths which were attributable to other causes - for example anaphylactic shock or accidents when someone was under the influence of drugs. In January 2016, the chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, Les Iversen, wrote to Home Office minister Karen Bradley highlighting increasing misuse of pregabalin and gabapentin and recommending they be reclassified as Class C drugs. Part of the problem, he said, was that in the UK, pregabalin and gabapentin prescribing had increased by 350% and 150%, respectively, in the previous five years. Both drugs remain prescription-only in the UK, even though pregabalin has been designated a Schedule V controlled drug in the US. The figures show that the majority - more than 70% - of drug misuse deaths are accidental and the highest death rate occurred in the group aged from 40 to 49 years old. The highest rate was among the 30-39 age group from 2003 to 2013 and in 2015. The number of 20 to 29-year-olds dying from drugs has been falling since the early noughties, so that in 2016, the lives of more 50 to 69-year-olds per million were taken by drugs than those aged 20-29. Deaths from fentanyl - a drug that is becoming a widespread problem on the streets of Britain, claiming the lives of users unaware of its potency - rose to 58 in 2016, up from 22 in 2012. Meanwhile, the number of people dying from taking new psychoactive substances - so-called legal highs - also rose, to 123, up from 55 in 2012."
2017-08-02,Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure from some of his own MPs to break his silence on the violence engulfing Venezuela and personally condemn President Nicolas Maduro.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170802235036/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-under-pressure-to-condemn-venezuela-10970635,"As fears over civil unrest and instability in the country grow, the Foreign Office said it had withdrawn the families of its embassy staff and warned Britons that they should consider leaving too. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has accused Mr Maduro of behaving like the ""dictator of an evil regime"" after he cracked down on anti-government protests following a widely disputed vote. The Trump administration also imposed financial sanctions on Mr Maduro in the wake of Sunday's election, which gave the ruling socialist party virtually unlimited power. The Labour Party issued a statement in the aftermath of the poll, with Labour's shadow foreign minister Liz McInnes urging ""the government of Venezuela to recognise its responsibilities to protect human rights, free speech and the rule of law"". The statement also said Mr Maduro must ""respond personally to the legitimate concerns of the international community about the increasingly authoritarian nature of his rule and the growing hardship facing his people"". But continuing turmoil in the country - including the late-night jailing of two opposition leaders - have piled pressure on Mr Corbyn to personally speak out. Labour MP Angela Smith, who has reportedly joined a new all-party parliamentary group on Venezuela, said: ""I think Corbyn needs to condemn the actions of the Venezuelan regime, which are a very serious threat to democracy in that country."" Graham Jones, another Labour MP and chairman of the group, told The Times: ""I believe everybody in the Labour Party should condemn the Venezuelan regime because the first duty of any state is to look after its citizens. ""Venezuela has failed."" In the past, Mr Corbyn has expressed support for Venezuela's socialist state, praising Mr Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez. As a backbencher, he attended a 2013 vigil following the death of Mr Chavez, calling him an ""inspiration to all of us fighting back against austerity and neo-liberal economics in Europe"". Mr Corbyn later supported a parliamentary motion congratulating Mr Maduro on his election victory via ""transparent and fair"" elections, and called for closer ties between Caracas and London. It also urged then-prime minister David Cameron to invite Mr Maduro to visit the UK at the earliest opportunity. With the Labour leader away on holiday, Labour referred back to its statement issued earlier in the week. The spokeswoman for Mr Corbyn said: ""The Labour Party's statement on Monday made clear our position on the importance of the respect for the rule of law and human rights. ""We're watching the situation and developments in Venezuela closely."" The row was seized upon by the Conservative Party, with Europe Minister Alan Duncan calling Mr Corbyn's silence ""astonishing"". ""When the world is condemning Venezuela and its government we don't hear a squeak from the leader of the opposition here in the UK, who for 20 years or more has said he's a great friend of Venezuela, that the socialist regime there is the perfect example of what a government should be,"" he told Sky News. A member of the shadow cabinet defended Mr Corbyn, telling Sky News that ""Labour has dealt with this issue, we've put out a statement."" ""This is just silly season and it's a politically motivated attack on Jeremy,"" the person said. ""This is trolling of the worst sort."" And Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary, also sought to play down the controversy. Asked about whether Mr Corbyn would personally condemn the regime, he said: ""It's an important issue but quite frankly when I go around my constituency it's not the first thing people ask me about. ""What's going on is unacceptable, we've said so, and the Labour Party made it abundantly clear that's the position."" Meanwhile, the Foreign Office said it was now advising ""against all but essential travel to the remaining areas of Venezuela, due to ongoing unrest and instability"". ""You should consider leaving the country by normal commercial means. There's a risk of significant disruption to transport links in and out of the country."""

The two occupants of the plane escaped unhurt and were led away by police. The plane made an emergency landing at Caparica, about 20 miles south of Lisbon, after getting into difficulties. Caparica beach was packed with sunbathers when the plane came down in sunny weather, at what is the height of the summer season. Ricardo Conceicao, a journalist at the scene, told Sky News that local people were very angry with the pilot of the plane for attempting an emergency landing on the beach. ""We don't know what happened, it is not clear yet,"" he explained. ""We are used to seeing small planes cruising along the shore, along the beach near Lisbon."" He stressed that the incident had been caused by an emergency landing and was not terrorism related. Photographs of the aircraft appeared to show it with a broken left wing. Firefighters and emergency services arrived at the beach shortly after the incident and cordoned off the area. Witnesses said the plane wobbled and skimmed the beach before landing, causing holidaymakers to panic. According to reports, some sunbathers ran into the sea."

Iryan Brown, 19, was arrested after the chase near Birmingham's Children's Hospital in September last year. In July he was ordered to be detained indefinitely in a mental health facility after admitting possession of a lock knife and making threats with the machete. ""Come on, I'll chop you"", Brown shouted at PCs Stuart Hill and Andy Carnall, who had pursued him from Printing House Street. They attempted to incapacitate Brown with CS spray before wrestling him to the ground in Constitution Hill. Sergeant Dominic Livesey praised the officers' courage, saying ""they acted without hesitation for their own safety to arrest an armed and violent suspect"". ""This was a scary, violent situation that could have ended very differently and with injury to members of the public, had the PCs not responded so bravely and brought the incident to a swift conclusion,"" he said. PC Hill, who has worked for West Midlands Police for nine years, said: ""We were in plain clothes on our way to recce an upcoming operation when the call came through about a man threatening people with a machete. ""It was rush hour so the roads were very busy. We knew we had to get a grip of him quickly as there was a clear danger to the public. ""I'm just pleased we managed to get hold of him pretty quickly and no one was hurt."" 49-year-old PC Carnall represents the force at cross-country running and entered the Police National Championships this year. ""I remember Brown looking over his shoulder at one stage and appearing shocked I was gaining on him,"" he said. ""That's when he turned and threatened to chop me with the machete. ""He was getting tired. I caught up with him and swept his legs away before handcuffing him."" As the officers were walking back to their police car PC Carnall says there were ""quite a few people clapping us in the street and saying well done"". ""It's nice to know the public appreciate our efforts to keep them safe."""

2017-08-02,The refreshing thing about the recent encryption debate is how readily politicians cheerfully admit that their plans have no basis in reality.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170802235036/http://news.sky.com/story/im-a-real-person-and-i-think-end-to-end-encryption-is-good-10970144,"Take Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian Prime Minister. Last month he proposed legislation that would force internet companies to remove end-to-end encryption, saying: ""The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia."" Mathematicians may disagree. The Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, does not. Writing in the Telegraph, she acknowledges the argument that it's impossible for a system to be end-to-end encrypted and give authorities access to it. If they do get access, someone else, like a hacker, might too, that argument goes. She writes: ""That might be true in theory. But the reality is different."" Once again: the theory is mathematics and it very much applies to reality. :: Rudd to meet tech firms over extremist content If you enjoy a feeling of deja vu, the arguments around encryption are good value. We've been arguing about back doors since Snowden in 2013. But you can glean some weak signs of how the debate might move forward - at least from the Home Secretary's side. Here's the new bit: real people. Rudd writes that ""real people often prefer ease of use and a multitude of features to perfect, unbreakable security"". That may be the case. But why not have both, if that's what's already on offer from WhatsApp and iMessage? It's also worth asking who Amber Rudd thinks ""real people"" are. I'm a real person, I think, and I believe end-to-end encryption is good. Rudd's use of the term quietly suggests that anyone who advocates for end-to-end encryption isn't a real person. Possibly, they're on the side of those terrorists and serious criminals. But real people care about security. Or perhaps it's better put like this: real people may not care about security, but they expect it. Security is not why we choose WhatsApp or iMessage, but it's part of the package. You might, for example, choose a bank account for all sorts of different reasons, like interest rates or perks. But you'd probably assume they have a fairly solid vault. As Silkie Carlo, policy officer at Liberty, says: ""Real people don't want to be hacked. Real people care about their privacy, they care about their civil liberties"". :: Is Rudd's tech ambition California Dreaming? When many NHS hospitals were taken offline thanks to a hacking technique stolen from the NSA, we all asked why they weren't secure. Imagine the same happening to more than a billion WhatsApp users. Hackers - whether solo or backed by nation states like Russia - will try and find the keys to our communications which government is currently demanding. There's a reason after all that MPs use WhatsApp for their secret communications. This is all frustrating because there were signs the groundhog day debate of encryption might be moving forward. Rudd writes that ""there are options"" and this might have been. The chief executive of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, told me earlier this year that there could be a ""middle ground"" on encryption. Facebook Messenger, for example, offers a form of encryption that can be turned off and on. But that's not end-to-end encryption. For the Home Secretary to suggest, yet again, that end-to-end encryption should be available to police shows she's not making a technical argument, but a political one."

At present, the Government must ""reasonably believe"" a person is or has been involved in terrorism and that freezing their assets is necessary to protect the public. But under the new plans, ministers would only need to have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect a person or group is or has been involved in terrorism and that sanctions are an ""appropriate action"". The Government says the legislation will enable post-Brexit Britain to continue to play a central role in global sanctions to combat the threats of terrorism, conflict and nuclear weapons. ""The new Sanctions Bill will ensure that when the UK leaves the EU, we retain the ability to impose, update and lift sanctions regimes, both to comply with our international obligations and in pursuit of our foreign policy and national security objectives,"" said Europe Minister Sir Alan Duncan. ""This will enable us to impose sanctions as appropriate either alone or with partners in the EU and around the world, to take targeted action against countries, organisations and individuals who contravene international law, commit or finance terrorism or threaten international peace and security."" Sir Alan told Sky News that the new system would allow for ""many safeguards"" against the ""reasonable grounds"" principle. ""There has to be evidence, there are also proper processes for people challenging this,"" he said. ""So it's a proper process which has checks and balances between our wishing to impose sanctions and companies or individuals challenging that."" At the moment, the UK is involved in over 30 sanctions regimes, including those against Russia, North Korea, Iran, ISIS and al Qaeda. :: What to do if a terror attack hits your holiday:: Is Rudd's tech ambition California Dreaming? Currently the UK takes part in non-UN sanctions through EU laws, but the Sanctions Bill will repatriate powers on non-UN sanctions from Brussels. The new legislation will make it easier to stop a suspected terrorist making money from their assets, such as selling their house or car, by freezing their bank account. ""These new powers will help us keep the British public safer from terrorist attacks by keeping money out of the hands of those wishing to cause us harm,"" said treasury minister Stephen Barclay. ""Our counter terrorist financing proposals will make it easier for law enforcement and government to impose sanctions on those that present a threat to our national or international security."""

The 20-year-old died after being chased and restrained by police on Saturday 22 July, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched an investigation. An unverified video, widely shared on social media, showed a police officer wrestling him to the ground, then restraining Mr Charles around his neck as he struggled on the floor. Mr Charles then stopped moving as he was handcuffed by the officer, and appeared unresponsive as a member of the public sat on him. He was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later. The death was followed by protests in Hackney. Last weekend, anger boiled over and riot police were called after bottles were thrown at police and skips were set on fire. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who is also MP for Hackney North, said of the forensic analysis: ""The IPCC's update, coupled with the release of a Metropolitan Police report highlighting a disproportionate use of force against BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) people will no doubt cause deep concern and upset. ""Urgent work must be done to rebuild trust and links between the police and the community."" Ms Abbott also called for ""peace on the streets"" and called violent demonstrations ""wrong"". The death of Mr Charles came little more than a month after the death of Edir Frederico da Costa, a young black man who died after coming into contact with police in Newham, east London. The full results of the IPCC's investigation into the death of Mr Charles will take several weeks to emerge. A post-mortem carried out on 24 July is awaiting the preliminary findings of a pathologist. ""Our independent investigation is thoroughly examining all aspects of police interaction with Rashan prior to his death and has already undertaken a large number of investigative actions,"" the commission said in a statement. Staff from the IPCC met with Mr Charles' family on Wednesday afternoon to update them with the results of the forensic analysis."

He became Captain General of the infantry force in 1953, following the death of the Queen's father George VI. The 1664 challenge raises money for The Royal Marines Charity. This year marines from around the country have run 16.64 miles each day for 100 days, totalling a distance of 1,664 miles, a symbolic number for the naval fighting force which traces its roots back to 1664. Buckingham Palace announced in May the Duke would not be taking on any more solo engagements from autumn this year. A palace spokeswoman said the parade would ""bring His Royal Highness's individual programme to a conclusion, although he may choose to attend certain events, alongside the Queen, from time-to-time"". :: Prince Philip: Speeches, plaques and gaffes It was the Duke who decided now was the right time to step back from public life, and he does so with the ""full support"" of the Queen. The palace has said it was not a decision made on the advice of doctors. Since 1952, Prince Philip has carried out 22,220 solo public engagements, taken 637 solo overseas trips, made 5,493 speeches and authored 14 books. He became the longest-serving consort in the British monarchy's history in 2009 and is the oldest ever male member of the British Royal Family. Phil Dampier, who has written several books about the Duke of Edinburgh, said it was the right decision for the Duke to wind down his duties. He told Sky News: ""At 96 I really do feel he deserves a rest. ""I don't think he's going to disappear completely, I'm sure he'll turn up for various jobs with the Queen here and there but the nice thing is now he can pick and choose them, and relax when he wants to, and that's good for the nation I think."" Buckingham Palace has confirmed there are no plans for the Queen to reduce her official workload. In a statement they said: ""Her Majesty will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements with the support of members of the Royal Family."" Younger members of Team Windsor, as the family have been described, will be expected to increase their royal workload to support the Queen. Last week Prince William gave up his job as an air ambulance pilot to become a full time royal. Philip, however, may pop up at public events from time to time, such as Trooping the Colour in future years or even support the Queen during the proposed state visit for US president Donald Trump. Martin Palmer, a close friend and adviser to the Duke, believes Prince Philip's support for the Queen and his personal contribution to national life should not be underestimated, as behind the scenes he remained head of the family as his wife carried out the role of head of state. Mr Palmer said: ""I think his greatest achievement has been to support the Queen through probably one of the most tempestuous periods the monarchy has ever been through and, in a sense, to wear the trousers in the family, so the Queen could wear the crown."""

EU countries have to carry out tougher checks on passengers entering or leaving the Schengen area, which covers most of mainland Europe (but not the UK) and lets people move passport-free. Travellers' details now have to be run through databases to see if they pose a threat. Airlines UK, an industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said it had warned the Department for Transport about the problem in May, although they were told by ministers the issue had eased.Tim Alderslade, the body's chief executive, said: ""It is now up to the UK Government to work with industry to use whatever influence it can within the EU to persuade Schengen member states to resource their border operations properly."" Airlines For Europe, a group which represents carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways' parent company IAG, claimed some passengers had missed flights due to the delays. A spokeswoman for travel trade organisation ABTA said: ""Tour operators will ensure that customers get to the airport in plenty of time so that they are not in danger of missing their flights. ""However, independent travellers will need to check the situation with their airlines and, where necessary, ensure they factor these longer queuing times into their travel plans when flying in and out of the airport. ""It is also extremely important that border control check points are sufficiently resourced so that queuing times are kept to a minimum."" Meanwhile, Barcelona airport is experiencing its own problems - unofficial strike action by security staff which has caused long queues and missed flights. ACETA, the association of Spanish air transport companies, said that, since 24 July, around 1,000 passengers had missed their flights. A spokeswoman for the airport's operator AENA said the problems had started around a week ago.

They discovered possible new treatments based on antimicrobial peptides that occur naturally in immune systems, and increase the body's natural response to infection. The five-year study, which cost £200,000, found the peptides from different mammals all contain properties which can fight rhinovirus, the main cause of colds in humans. During experiments which used peptides made in a laboratory, the molecule successfully attacked the cold virus. In the next stages of the research, scientists will try to modify the peptide to make it better at killing the rhinovirus. Dr Peter Barlow, associate professor of immunology and infection at the university, said: ""This study represents a major step towards finding a treatment."" Research is still in the early stages, but Dr Barlow said: ""This is an exciting discovery and our next steps will be to modify the peptide to make it even better at killing this virus.

He is expected to arrive in the French capital by Friday at the latest to complete his move. Barcelona spokesman Josep Vives confirms Neymar has asked to leave the club. It is understood the total value of the five-year deal is worth nearly £450m (€500m) - including wages, bonuses and a buyout clause of £198m (€222m). Neymar has been offered a basic salary of £26.8m a year (€30m) after tax, which comes to about £515,000 a week. Barcelona confirmed the buyout clause will have to be ""deposited in its entirety"". A source in Spain close to Neymar has told Sky Sports News: ""Since he decided to leave, Neymar has had to deal with huge pressure to stay at Barcelona. His teammates wanted him to stay but his decision was made."" The source went on: ""People will say this has been driven by money, but he wants to become the leader at the club. He wants to be independent, and wants to win the Ballon d'Or. He believes he can do that in Paris."" PSG has yet to confirm whether an agreement has been reached. Since joining Barcelona in 2013, Neymar has helped keep the club at the pinnacle of European football and turned into a worldwide star.

According to British Gas, the price rise is needed to offset the fact that delivering electricity to homes is getting more expensive. While wholesale prices - the amount British Gas itself pays for power before passing it on to customers - have largely fallen since the start of the year, the company says that rises in the cost of transmitting that electricity mean that they are currently selling power at a loss. British Gas also points to increases in the cost of implementing ""energy policy""; that is, requirements set by the Government regarding the move to renewable energies and environmental impact. :: Is Centrica the only company increasing its bills? At the moment, yes. But British Gas is the only one of the ""Big Six"" energy firms to have held off raising prices over the past winter. British Gas has had a price freeze in place since December of last year, while SSE, E.ON, Scottish Power, EDF and npower have all hiked customers' bills since January. A few of the smaller suppliers have also increased tariffs - First Utility raised bills 9.7% in April and Co-op Energy announced 5% increase in April. :: I have a British Gas pre-payment meter, will I be affected? No - the price rise won't be applied to those customers who pay for their electricity using a pre-payment meter. :: I don't think I can afford this price rise - what do I do? British Gas says it will be offering help to 200,000 of their most vulnerable customers, to alleviate the difficulties they'll face following the price hike. Anyone who gets their energy from British Gas and already qualifies for the Warm Home Discount will automatically have their account credited with £76 - the amount an average dual fuel bill will increase by over the next year because of the price rise. This should mean that, for most people who receive the discount, the hike will have no effect on how much they have to pay."

He once shared a risque joke with Prince William, a helicopter pilot, and told the royal off for ""flying choppers instead of proper aeroplanes"". Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, the Chief of the Air Staff, said: ""Ken, as one of The Few, represented an extraordinary generation to whom we owe a great debt that should never be forgotten. ""Our freedom being won by their sacrifices."" In the skies above the UK 77 years ago, Spitfire pilots from East Anglian bases fought the Nazis, who were threatening to invade the country. Born in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, Mr Wilkinson, who became a chartered surveyor, discovered his passion for flying while watching aircraft tests at Farnborough. At the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the RAF and flew their famous fighter with 616 and 19 Squadrons, protecting industrial targets in the Midlands. In an interview for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 2015, he said: ""I didn't carry any lucky charms, but I did wear a pair of my wife's knickers around my neck. ""And I was one of the lucky ones. I saw friends fall out of the sky, aircraft go up in flames ... terrible things."" John Nichol, a former RAF navigator shot down and captured in the 1991 Gulf War, tweeted a picture of himself with the veteran pilot. He wrote: ""He was a true gentleman & loved a glass of red. RIP Sir."" Very sad to learn that Battle Britain Spitfire pilot Ken Wilkinson has died aged 99. He was a true gentleman & loved a glass of red. RIP Sir pic.twitter.com/n7wvcd6hSL Writer Frank Crosby said he had a ""robust"" sense of humour and told how the Second World War veteran reacted at an event after a pilot namesake died and people thought it was him. Mr Crosby said: ""People had contacted his family and offered their condolences. He arrived and asked if he could contribute to a whip-round for his own wreath."" He was described by the wife of a fellow RAF pilot as one of the ""the Brylcreem Boys with a twinkle in their eyes"". Mr Wilkinson, of Solihull, Birmingham, passed away on Monday and is survived by his daughter, Penny, and grandson, Piers."

MI5 and undercover police officers had set up a fake firm in the city called Hero Couriers which employed both Hussain and Ali. The pair were being monitored after earlier terrorist related convictions. During Ali's first day working at the Birmingham firm last August, police searched his black Seat car and were surprised to find the bomb alongside ammunition, an imitation handgun and a meat cleaver with the word ""kafir"" (disbeliever) scratched into the blade. It prompted a major security alert and the area around Florence Street close to the city centre went into lockdown with the Army's bomb squad tasked with making sure the pipe bomb would not explode. The four men had denied plotting the attack and claimed in court an undercover MI5 officer known as Vincent had planted the bomb in the vehicle. The trial was held partly in secret. Vincent was cross-examined over 12 days and repeatedly rejected the allegations against him. Jurors agreed with him and, after deliberating for 22 hours, convicted Ali, 29, Hussain, 25, and Rahman, 33, of preparing terrorist acts. Aziz, 38, was found guilty of the same offence after the jury deliberated for another 20 minutes. Next door neighbours Ali and Hussain had previously been convicted after travelling to Pakistan to attend a terror training camp although neither man went through with the training. Rahman had earlier served a five-year sentence for possessing materials linked to terrorism. The three men met inside HMP Belmarsh in south east London and went on to plot the pipe bomb attack that was intercepted by the authorities. West Midlands police arrested the four men shortly after they had discovered the bomb and have been unable to identify where the men had planned to detonate it. As they were led from the dock, one of the convicted men shouted out: ""I hope you're happy with your lies. Lying scumbags."""

The 20-year-old had only been in the war-torn country for four months, and he died from a single gunshot wound to the head.  Mr Lock had been seriously injured in battle and was surrounded by IS fighters when he decided to kill himself to avoid being captured or tortured.  His mother, Catherine Lock, had no idea that her son was planning on travelling to Syria. Instead, she thought he was going backpacking around Turkey. She said: ""He just said that he had planned this for ages and that he had time off work. He said he would be going for a few weeks, maybe a month. ""And when I found out he was going to Turkey I said: 'You do realise that's right next to Syria, where there is a war.' ""I hadn't twigged that was exactly his plan, to head to Syria."" A day after Mr Lock arrived in Turkey last August, he told his mother that he had signed up to fight for the People's Defence Units (YPG), a Kurdish military force. She contacted the police immediately and continued to stay in contact with her son on Facebook Messenger, where he regularly posted pictures of himself during his military training. It was at the start of December that Mr Lock's mother became increasingly concerned because she had not heard from him for two weeks. His father started looking for information online and came across a picture of his son's body, with an IS fighter standing over him. Mr Lock, who worked as a chef, had no previous military training. However, he had always shown an interest in joining the Army and enjoyed playing military-style computer games. A Canadian man who is believed to have fought alongside him in Syria wrote to Ms Lock following his death, and said her son had ""died a true hero"" and his sacrifice would be remembered. Dozens of people, including members of the Kurdish community, held roses and framed pictures of Mr Lock when his body was repatriated to the UK at Heathrow Airport in February. In court, the coroner told Mr Lock's parents that they should be proud of their son, who gave up a comfortable life in West Sussex to fight for a cause he passionately believed in. Recording a narrative verdict, Portsmouth and South East Hampshire coroner David Horsley described Mr Lock as a ""heroic young man""."

But her attempt at playing Cupid ended in embarrassment when she was dismissed from the jury. The juror who had confessed to the crush, however, was allowed to remain. The romantic intrigue was exposed during the trial, when a Guardian reporter overheard a conversation about the heart-throb status of DS Chambers. After the reporter asked whether the judge was aware about the issue, Mr Justice Globe held an urgent inquiry - just days before the jury was dismissed. The inquiry revealed that a juror had tried to find out DS Chambers' relationship status on three occasions after failing in her first try to recruit the court usher as an informant. The juror in question was named by both the usher and the friend who fancied the policeman. She denied her involvement when she was questioned by Mr Justice Globe - prompting the judge to dismiss her for not being ""frank"" with him. The other juror confessed to finding DS Chambers attractive, but said she had no plans to pursue the officer and that advances on him had been made against her wishes. Mr Justice Globe allowed her to remain on the jury - saving a trial that had already been troubled by allegations of police corruption and disrupted by the Westminster and Manchester terror attacks. Lawyers for the defendants had argued that the fiasco presented serious problems Rajiv Menon, QC for Khobaib Hussain, called it an ""astonishing move"". ""Why the laughter? Why the deception?"" he asked. ""This is a matter that should be investigated."" The defendants, men belonging to a gang calling themselves the ""musketeers"", were found guilty of plotting bomb and knife attacks on Wednesday. When explaining the situation to other jurors, Mr Justice Globe said he was ""very disappointed"" that no one had blown the whistle on the romantic intrigue."

The blow for the north has been doubly controversial because it coincided with the go-ahead for a new £30bn Crossrail 2 scheme in London and the South East. And it was followed within days by a proposal from the Government to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars from 2040 and force drivers to switch to electric cars. Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham claims people in the north are having to put up with sub-standard rail services while the Government treats London as a priority. And now the Labour Party says that by u-turning on electrification, the Tories are pulling the plug on the proposed ""Crossrail for the Northern Powerhouse"" project. The party claims cancelling rail electrification projects around the country will mean longer journey times between: Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary said: ""The Government's disgraceful u-turn on their promise to deliver electrification on the Midland Mainline, Trans-Pennine and Great Western routes will threaten economic growth in areas of England and Wales already suffering from poor connectivity and under-investment. ""Pulling the plug on electrification shows the Tories' disregard for Wales and Yorkshire, which will continue to suffer from underinvestment, and proves the 'Midlands Engine' and the 'Northern Powerhouse' are just more empty slogans from this Government. ""The Tories are trying to pull the wool over people's eyes by claiming that diesel bi-mode trains will deliver the same benefits as electrification, despite saying for years that failure to electrify the network costs more in the long run, causes more pollution, worsens air quality, lessens capacity and makes services slower and less reliable."" :: First passengers travel on Elizabeth line train:: Crossrail contractors fined over death of worker Labour says Network Rail estimates that electrification and the running of electric vehicles could help reduce CO2 emissions by an average of 20-30% compared to their diesel counterparts. And it claims the maintenance costs for electric trains are 33% lower than for diesel. The party also says Network Rail estimates that electric passenger vehicles fuel savings are between 19 and 26 pence per vehicle mile. But a Department for Transport spokesman hit back: ""The Government is completely committed to improving services for passengers in every part of the country - and to suggest otherwise is nonsense. ""By investing in new train technology, we're able to deliver all the benefits of electrification, but without the disruption of massive engineering works. ""We're spending £55.7bn building HS2, which will provide a massive boost to the Northern Powerhouse by better connecting it to London and the Midlands. ""And we're completely committed to working with Transport for the North as they develop their proposals for a high-speed Northern Powerhouse rail service across the Pennines."" Last week, after the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling gave the go-ahead for Crossrail 2, Mr Burnham said the announcement would cause ""widespread anger"" in the North. ""It will not escape people's notice that this commitment to London comes just days after the Transport Secretary cancelled electrification schemes all over the country,"" he said. ""It raises the question of whether taxpayers everywhere else outside of London are paying to make Crossrail 2 viable."" Rail unions have condemned the Government's diesel car ban in light of the scrapping of plans to electrify parts of the rail network. Mick Cash, the RMT's general secretary, said the ban ""exposes the rank hypocrisy of their decision to shelve long-planned rail electrification works""."

Ministers want the country to have the lowest energy costs in Europe for households and businesses. But earlier this week there was anger when British Gas said it was putting up electricity prices by 12.5% for 3.1 million customers. The review, headed by Oxford University professor Dieter Helm, will investigate key factors affecting bills, including energy and carbon pricing, efficiency measures and regulation. He said: ""My review will be independent and sort out the facts from the myths about the cost of energy, and make recommendations about how to more effectively achieve the overall objectives."" It will look for ways of reducing costs and consider how moving to electric vehicles and developments in storing energy, robotics and artificial intelligence will affect the industry. Extending the scope for auctions in the energy market will also be investigated along with making the supply chain less complex. But the study will not examine whether there should be a cap on price rises for 17 million households - a Tory pre-election commitment watered down after Theresa May lost her Commons majority. The Government has said it is taking action to cut bills and has asked energy regulator Ofgem for proposals to extend price protection to more people on the poorest value tariffs. By 2050, the UK is legally obliged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said: ""The review will consider how we can take advantage of changes to our power system and new technologies to ensure clean, secure and affordable supplies over the coming decades."" Alex Neill from consumer group Which? said: ""It is right to look at how to keep costs down, but yet another review is going to be cold comfort to the millions overpaying on their energy bills right now. ""Consumers need to see urgent action from the Government and regulator to tackle the lack of competition in the market and to ensure they are getting a good deal."""

It is the latest part of a scheme costing £800m overall. This phase will cause considerable disruption to South West Trains services from popular commuter areas such as Guildford, Woking and Surbiton. The impact is also likely to be felt at other busy London stations, such as Clapham Junction, Wimbledon, Earlsfield, Richmond and Vauxhall. Passengers are being warned to expect fewer services and longer journeys on lines heading to Waterloo as South West Trains says it will be operating a significantly reduced service. Some stations will be closed, while those that remain open are likely to be busier and may even use queuing systems to cope. With 270,000 passengers per day - 130,000 during the peak rush hour of 7am-10am - rail bosses are urging travellers to consider taking holiday, working from home or changing their travel times while the work is being carried out. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne has previously admitted he is ""worried there will be challenging days"" and accepted that ""there are going to be days when the service is very difficult for people"". Platforms 1-10 at Waterloo will be closed, but to help cope with the disruption, five platforms formerly used for Eurostar services will be re-opened and South West trains will also run longer trains through the day. This phase of the project culminates on the August Bank Holiday weekend, when work is also happening at London Bridge, Euston, Liverpool Street and Paddington."

Dean told Sky News: ""We'd fostered children when we lived in Kent, and we saw how they responded to our pets - they allowed them to come out of their shell. ""Animals are being used in therapy more and more, and we were drawn to the idea of using the animals to help people."" As soon as Dean saw the Animalarium Borth Zoo, in Ceredigion, he knew it was meant to be. ""We'd spent holidays in Snowdonia before, but never Mid Wales. As soon as we drove over the hill and saw it we both knew we would live there."" Moving from Milton Regis in Kent, the animal-loving family - who already had about 40 pets - found a whole new raft of exotic animals to care for. The £625,000 zoo has more than 300 animals, including lions, monkeys, meerkats, a leopard, crocodiles, turtles, wallabies (including a rare albino wallaby), lemurs, peacocks and osprey flying overhead. There is also a reptile house, with snakes including ""a medium sized"" 15ft snake, and a 22ft female boa constrictor. For those looking for a more tactile experience, there is also a petting barn with ponies, lambs, cows, goats, pigs, rabbits and Guinea pigs. And Dean's daughters - Sophie, 13, Sarah, nine, and Paige, eight - can't get enough of the animals during the summer holidays. ""From the moment they wake up they are helping the zookeepers,"" Dean said. ""All their friends are keen to have sleepovers. They couldn't be happier."" While Dean insists he ""is no Matt Damon"" and wasn't inspired by the 2011 film We Bought A Zoo, he has spoken to the man whose life the film is based on, Benjamin Mee. The former bricklayer, who bought the dilapidated Dartmoor Wildlife Park in Devon back in 2007, before opening it to the public the following year, has offered his words of wisdom to the Tweedy family as they go about returning the zoo to its former glory. While Mr Tweedy says he has ""no plans yet for an elephant or a rhinoceros"", the next job on his list is to engage boy scouts in painting the meerkat enclosure. ""I'm keen to get some social projects going, get local people involved with the zoo,"" he said. ""Lots of the animals here were rescued - either from other zoos or from owners who they'd got too big for. The leopard used to belong to an Indian prince, but once he started showing an inclination to eat his owner, he gave him to the zoo. ""He's so used to being around people, he has trouble relating to other leopards."" He added: ""Our dream is to make it a sanctuary for people as well as animals""."

As the chairman begins to compile his terms of reference, here are six questions people want answered. 1. Why did a small fire in a fridge spread so quickly and why were so many people not able to escape?  A thorough understanding of forensic details on how the fire spread, and of the catastrophic failure of the measures in place to keep people safe, are the most pressing issues. 2. How could this happen in a building refurbished in 2016, at a cost of £10m and approved and signed off by one of London's wealthiest boroughs?  Every aspect of the building will be examined, from its original design to subsequent alterations and the latest refurbishment. 3. What documentary evidence can be found to show who was responsible for crucial aspects of the building's design and construction, and whether they did they did their jobs properly?  Chancellor Philip Hammond controversially claimed that the combustible polyethylene cladding attached to the outside of the building is banned in the UK, but the inquiry will want to look at other issues too, including the polyisocyanurate insulation panels that released deadly hydrogen cyanide gas as they burned. 4. Where were building control officers and the Government's fire investigators and safety advisers while tower blocks across the country were being covered in material that burns but was passed as fire safe?  Last year, the Government was assured by its advisers BRE Global that regulations were ""adequate"" to keep people safe. Now, the Prime Minister has said an investigation into the problem will need to look back decades. Failures in building control are potentially the most far-reaching issues to tackle. 5. Who is responsible?  As high-rise buildings across the country are stripped of their cladding following Government-ordered emergency tests, the construction industry - and the officials who regulate, advise and test its products - are all under pressure. 6. When will it end?  The Government has said it wants some answers soon, and it is thought an interim report could come out this summer. But the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war shows how public inquiries can get bogged down when those who face criticism are given the opportunity to respond before publication.

It meant sales were 2.2% down on the year to date. The SMMT reported a drop of 20% in new diesel sales - with petrol vehicles falling 3% - in a month that saw the Government confirm plans to ban their sale from 2040 in a bid to improve air quality. Ministers are also considering funding measures to cut pollution with a tax on new diesels. Hybrid and electric sales jumped by almost 65%, with almost 9,000 models sold, the SMMT said. Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, commented: ""The fall in consumer and business confidence is having a knock-on effect on demand in the new car market and government must act quickly to provide concrete plans regarding Brexit. ""While it's encouraging to see record achievements for alternatively fuelled vehicles, consumers considering other fuel types will have undoubtedly been affected by the uncertainty surrounding the government's clean air plans. ""It is important to remember that there are no plans to charge drivers using the latest Euro 6 models and no proposed bans for conventional petrol and diesel vehicles for some 23 years."" He suggested prices - many of which were raised after the Brexit vote - could now be coming down in a bid to shift stock. The boom in sales witnessed in recent years, the SMMT had always admitted, was unsustainable - aided first by PPI compensation payouts to consumers by banks, a rush to avoid car tax changes and by cheap finance. It insisted there was no bubble in the credit market as regulators fear a surge in deals such as personal contract purchase agreements returning to haunt consumers and lenders alike as the economy stutters towards Brexit. The SMMT's director of communications, Tamzen Isacsson, said: ""Finance offers an affordable and flexible way for motorists to buy a new car, with fixed monthly payments and APR that are generally lower than for personal loans. ""Car finance is governed by very strict rules, and anyone taking out a package will have the terms and conditions explained to them by the dealer and in writing. ""As with any major purchase, customers are advised to do their own research and to make sure they are getting the best deal on offer, and one that is within their budget."""
2017-08-05,"Residents and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire say they are confident they have done all they can to contribute to the public inquiry - and for them, it is the criminal investigation which takes priority.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170806075955/http://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-survivors-we-are-not-prepared-to-be-walked-over-10972869,"The deadline has now passed for those affected by the blaze to submit the questions they want answered. More than 400 submissions were received by the Friday afternoon cut-off after campaigners used all means possible including making videos, leaflets and newsletters to encourage involvement. The suggestions will form part of the terms of reference of the Government inquiry led by Sir Martin Moore-Bick. Campaigners said they would strongly oppose any form of ""limited"" inquiry. The Justice4Grenfell group urged him to include an examination of local and national social housing policy and whether it ""increased risks to residents"". In the group's submission, six suggestions for the terms of reference were included. It said the inquiry's fundamental purpose should be restoring public confidence in the safety of ""social housing nationally"" and the ""competence, ability and willingness of public authorities to oversee, regulate and ensure"" it. Calls were also included for Kensington and Chelsea Council to face scrutiny alongside the Home Office, 10 Downing Street and the Department for Communities and Local Government. The group wrote: ""The inquiry must uncover the correspondence and documents within these departments that go to the heart of the failed housing and social policies that caused or exacerbated the fire, along with the appalling response in the aftermath. ""The inquiry should seek and obtain internal communications between Government ministers, MPs, councillors and civil servants on matters relating to the Grenfell Tower disaster and the issues related to it."" :: Grenfell fire: Six questions for the inquiry to answer Before the inquiry has even started there are signals it could be suspended if charges are brought in the criminal investigation into the fire - creating the potential for conflict with the public inquiry. Last week, police announced they have reasonable grounds to suspect Kensington and Chelsea council and the organisation that managed the tower block of committing corporate manslaughter. Resident Jacqui Haynes said there is no end to the questions the community wants answered. She said: ""I have faith that we have put our views forward and we've had meetings and enabled our community to respond to the terms of reference. ""We have been very strong and are not prepared to be walked over and we do want answers. ""But my faith in the systems that are meant to support us is lacking. We want people to be held accountable, we want changes to be made and we want to make sure it doesn't happen again."" Sir Martin is the retired judge who will now be reviewing the questions from the community but there are doubts over whether residents will get all the answers they want from him and his team, which has been marred with criticism for lacking the right skillset and diversity to be effective. It has been seven weeks since the Grenfell Tower fire and for families who lost loved ones the most pressing issue is bringing criminal charges against those accountable. A spokesman for the public inquiry said: ""The inquiry is currently consulting on its terms of reference. ""Once these are finalised by the Prime Minister, we will assess how our work relates to other inquiries and investigations relating to the Grenfell Tower fire."" Sir Martin is expected to set out his terms of reference next week which will form the scope of the inquiry and outline what it hopes to achieve. This will then be sent to Theresa May for final approval."
2017-08-05,"Fifteen billion pounds. For those of you who've lived through the past decade - crisis after crisis, of governments routinely spending enormous amounts to bail out their banks - that might not sound like a lot of money.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170806075955/http://news.sky.com/story/the-15bn-stimulus-the-bank-does-and-doesnt-want-10972127,"But, for what it's worth, it amounts to about £550 for every household in the country. It's equivalent to a 3p one-off income tax cut. :: Bank issues pay warning and cuts growth forecast as rates held It would finance the construction of Britain's two new (monumentally expensive) aircraft carriers, and still leave change for three more. So the fact that the Bank of England announced today that it would electronically print an extra £15bn of money to pour into Britain's financial system is not without consequence. But if the Bank gets its way you're unlikely to hear much about this in the press. That's because this £15bn is going into one of the most technical, abstruse schemes the Bank has ever devised. The Term Funding Scheme was established in the wake of last year's Brexit vote, to encourage banks to lend more cash to consumers and to pass on lower interest rates to households. In short, the Bank was worried that with interest rates at historic lows, high street lenders (whose business models rely on making a turn on their loans) would fail to pass on the rate cut to consumers. So the BoE promised to lend those banks money - and lots of it - if they lent it on to their customers. And where did the BoE get that money? It printed it. Over the past year, the Bank has printed more than £78bn of cash and lent it to Britain's banks to encourage them to lend. While this is subtly different to the quantitative easing scheme in some senses (under QE the Bank printed money to buy assets; in the TFS it prints money to lend to banks temporarily, taking collateral in exchange), in other senses it is similar. For one thing, it involves a sharp increase in the size of the Bank's balance sheet. After this increase the total size of the Asset Purchase Facility (basically all the money the Bank has printed) will rise from £545bn to £560bn. For another, it acts as a stimulus for the economy. It won't have escaped your attention that over the past few months a number of economists (including, ironically, some at the Bank), have sounded the alarm over rising rates of consumer debt. Well, the chances are a good chunk of that lending has been encouraged by this BoE scheme. Lo and behold, the Bank has now announced that as things stand, consumer lending is increasing at such a rate that by the time the TFS comes to the end of its life, next February, it will have breached the £100bn total the Bank expected from it. That left the Bank with two choices: increase the total amount going into the TFS, or shorten its life. It chose the former. In some senses, that was the easy decision. It is not for the Monetary Policy Committee to intervene in the financial system (there is a difference). That is the job of another part of the Bank - the Financial Policy Committee. But it does leave us in an interesting situation. It is quite plausible the FPC introduces some checks and constraints on lending in the coming months. So the Bank would effectively be pressing the accelerator and the brake pedal at one and the same time."

British Airways sent text messages to customers warning them of long delays and promised to re-book passengers who miss their flights because of the queues. Meanwhile, Ryanair and EasyJet also alerted flyers - with the latter advising customers to allow extra time ""to be able to get to the gate on time"". :: What you need to know about the longer security checks Sky Correspondent Katerina Vittozzi, reporting from Palma Airport in Majorca, said extra staff had been brought in to deal with the high volume of passengers travelling to and from the island. She said: ""It is anticipated that there is a risk we could see further delays through the day."" On Friday, a number of passengers vented their frustration over lengthy delays at airports across the continent. Paul Steenkamp said queues at Barcelona's El Prat Airport - worsened by security staff strike action - were ""massive"". He said at least three hours were required to get through security checks, adding: ""Chaos is an understatement."" Another passenger said ""huge delays"" at the same airport were ""not worth the hassle"". Meanwhile, other flyers complained about arriving early to find no delays in passport control areas. Jason Walsh tweeted: ""Come to the airport early, they said. There are delays, they said. Now have three hours to wait in airport."" As part of the security checks, travellers' details have to be run through databases to see if they pose a threat. The new rules have been introduced following terror attacks in Paris and Brussels. Aviation minister Lord Callanan has said he will urge his counterparts in Portugal, Spain and Italy to ""do all they can to reduce queues and allow travellers to get on with their holidays""."

Experts say such clouds are normally closer to the poles. They believe a huge high-pressure, dark vortex anchored deep in the atmosphere may have caused the storm, which is almost as big as Earth. Gases rising up in the vortex are thought to be cooling and condensing out to form clouds. Unlike the watery clouds on Earth, those on Neptune consist of methane. Professor Imke de Pater, from the University of California at Berkeley in the US, said: ""Historically, very bright clouds have occasionally been seen on Neptune. ""But usually at latitudes closer to the poles, around 15 to 60 degrees north or south. Never before has a cloud been seen at or so close to the equator, nor has one ever been this bright."" But it may not be linked to a vortex and instead could be a huge convective cloud similar to those seen on other planets, including one detected on Saturn in 2010. However, a convective cloud would be expected to ""smear out"" significantly over a period of about a week. UC Berkeley graduate student Ned Molter made the discovery during a dawn test run of the WM Keck Observatory telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii. Mr Molter, who observed it getting much brighter between 26 June and 2 July, said: ""Seeing a storm this bright at such a low latitude is extremely surprising."" Neptune, the fourth biggest planet in the solar system, is the windiest with wind speeds at the equator reaching up to 1,000mph. In comparison, a Category 5 hurricane on Earth has wind speeds of 156mph and the most powerful tornadoes spin at around 300mph."

The case concerned four pieces of footage which had been filmed using a high-powered camera in a South Yorkshire Police helicopter. Sheffield Crown Court heard how one woman was recorded as she sunbathed naked in her garden with her daughters - and another video involved naturists at a campsite. The jury was also shown an 11-minute sequence which clearly featured a couple having sex on their patio. At one point, the woman being filmed waved at the helicopter. In the fourth video, a couple were filmed as they sunbathed while naked. The police officers and the pilots had been charged after PC Adrian Pogmore shot the footage. The 51-year-old officer was the only person in the aircraft when all four of the explicit videos were filmed, and he had admitted four counts of misconduct in a public office last month. During the trial, the four men told the jury they did not know what Pogmore was doing as he used the chopper's camera. Pogmore, described by prosecutors as a ""swinging and sex-obsessed air observer"", knew the couple who were filmed having sex from the wife-swapping scene. Some of the defendants appeared to be in tears after the jury foreman returned the verdicts following four hours of deliberations. In the public gallery overlooking the court, their families hugged each other and cried - and Mr Lucas said ""thank you"" to the jury as he left the courtroom. The judge said: ""The defendants are dismissed. You can all go home."" Pogmore was dismissed by South Yorkshire Police back in 2015, and he will be sentenced on Tuesday. In a statement, the force said it intends to continue with internal misconduct proceedings against the officers who were acquitted by the court."

She was arrested at Tehran Airport in April last year while visiting family in Iran with daughter Gabriella. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told Sky News of his hopes that Mr Burt's talks would lead to her freedom. Mr Ratcliffe said he hoped the politician ""raises her case as much as possible, presses the Iranian government that this situation cannot continue, and that she's innocent and should be released"". He said he believed the UK government ""sincerely cared"" about the case. But he also complained ministers had never spoken out and criticised her treatment, never said she was innocent and never publicly called for her release. She has been held alone at Evin prison for the past nine months but Mr Ratcliffe said he had recently been able to talk to her on the phone every week. He said she was in a ""fragile state"" and has seen a psychiatrist who diagnosed she has advanced depression. Mr Ratcliffe said: ""She's been talking in very dark terms about what she might do. ""My job is to keep campaigning and to keep her knowing we're all rooting for her, she's not forgotten and we'll try to bring her home as soon as possible."" Mr Foroughi, 77, is held in the same jail for alleged espionage in Iran. He has strenuously maintained his innocence. He was detained in 2011 before being convicted of espionage and possessing alcohol two years later. His son, Kamran Foroughi, told Sky News: ""I am always grateful for the UK Government's intervention. The longer this goes on, the more worried we are about my dad's health.

The most senior family court judge in England and Wales, Sir James Munby, said he felt ""shame and embarrassment"" after finding there were no suitable places available for the girl when she is released from a secure unit later this month. But in an update, medical director for the NHS North Region Dr Mike Prentice, said: ""Following extensive assessments, the NHS has identified a bed for this young woman in a safe and appropriate care setting which will best meet her needs. ""The bed will be available ahead of the release date."" At the unit where the girl is being held, staff have said that sending her back to her home town would be a ""suicide mission to a catastrophic level"". The teenager's barrister, Simon Rowbottom, told Sky News he understood there were ""at least two other cases in the country that may be similar in circumstances"". The case ""should make us all feel ashamed"", Sir James said in a ruling. ""For my own part, acutely conscious of my powerlessness, of my inability to do more for X, I feel shame and embarrassment,"" he added, saying that if no suitable place was found, ""we will have blood on our hands"". Sir James noted that Britain was one of the richest countries in the world, ""even in these times of austerity"". He said the case was a ""disgrace to any country with pretensions to civilisation, compassion and, dare one say it, basic human decency"". A copy of the judgment is being sent to Whitehall. ""It is hoped that the Government will listen"", Mr Rowbottom said. He added: ""We looked not just across the whole of England but Wales and Scotland as well for a bed for X. ""If that isn't a sign that something needs to be done by those in a position to properly fund these resources then I don't know what is."" Since the judgment was made, beds have been identified in three appropriate settings."

2017-08-06,British holidaymakers flying home from Europe have been warned to arrive at airports with at least three hours to spare amid severe delays caused by new passport controls.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170806143415/http://news.sky.com/story/british-holidaymakers-warned-of-massive-delays-at-eu-airports-10973889,"Passengers have queued for up to four hours at airports in Italy, Portugal, France, Spain and Belgium following the introduction of more stringent checks for travellers entering and leaving the EU's passport-free area. British Airways sent text messages to customers warning them of long delays and promised to re-book passengers who miss their flights because of the queues. Meanwhile, Ryanair and EasyJet also alerted flyers - with the latter advising customers to allow extra time ""to be able to get to the gate on time"". :: What you need to know about the longer security checks Sky Correspondent Katerina Vittozzi, reporting from Palma Airport in Majorca, said extra staff had been brought in to deal with the high volume of passengers travelling to and from the island. She said: ""It is anticipated that there is a risk we could see further delays through the day."" On Friday, a number of passengers vented their frustration over lengthy delays at airports across the continent. Paul Steenkamp said queues at Barcelona's El Prat Airport - worsened by security staff strike action - were ""massive"". He said at least three hours were required to get through security checks, adding: ""Chaos is an understatement."" Another passenger said ""huge delays"" at the same airport were ""not worth the hassle"". Meanwhile, other flyers complained about arriving early to find no delays in passport control areas. Jason Walsh tweeted: ""Come to the airport early, they said. There are delays, they said. Now have three hours to wait in airport."" As part of the security checks, travellers' details have to be run through databases to see if they pose a threat. The new rules have been introduced following terror attacks in Paris and Brussels. Aviation minister Lord Callanan has said he will urge his counterparts in Portugal, Spain and Italy to ""do all they can to reduce queues and allow travellers to get on with their holidays""."
2017-08-06,"When Dean and Tracy Tweedy started making enquiries to buy a small petting zoo in Kent, little did they know they'd end up buying a working zoo in Wales - complete with lions, monkeys and a leopard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170806143415/http://news.sky.com/story/family-moves-in-with-lions-and-monkeys-after-buying-zoo-in-wales-10974705,"Keen to incorporate animal therapy with Tracy's job as a psychotherapist, the couple quickly found that the South East was built up and expensive, so took their search a little further afield. Dean told Sky News: ""We'd fostered children when we lived in Kent, and we saw how they responded to our pets - they allowed them to come out of their shell. ""Animals are being used in therapy more and more, and we were drawn to the idea of using the animals to help people."" As soon as Dean saw the Animalarium Borth Zoo, in Ceredigion, he knew it was meant to be. ""We'd spent holidays in Snowdonia before, but never Mid Wales. As soon as we drove over the hill and saw it we both knew we would live there."" Moving from Milton Regis in Kent, the animal-loving family - who already had about 40 pets - found a whole new raft of exotic animals to care for. The £625,000 zoo has more than 300 animals, including lions, monkeys, meerkats, a leopard, crocodiles, turtles, wallabies (including a rare albino wallaby), lemurs, peacocks and osprey flying overhead. There is also a reptile house, with snakes including ""a medium sized"" 15ft snake, and a 22ft female boa constrictor. For those looking for a more tactile experience, there is also a petting barn with ponies, lambs, cows, goats, pigs, rabbits and Guinea pigs. And Dean's daughters - Sophie, 13, Sarah, nine, and Paige, eight - can't get enough of the animals during the summer holidays. ""From the moment they wake up they are helping the zookeepers,"" Dean said. ""All their friends are keen to have sleepovers. They couldn't be happier."" While Dean insists he ""is no Matt Damon"" and wasn't inspired by the 2011 film We Bought A Zoo, he has spoken to the man whose life the film is based on, Benjamin Mee. The former bricklayer, who bought the dilapidated Dartmoor Wildlife Park in Devon back in 2007, before opening it to the public the following year, has offered his words of wisdom to the Tweedy family as they go about returning the zoo to its former glory. While Mr Tweedy says he has ""no plans yet for an elephant or a rhinoceros"", the next job on his list is to engage boy scouts in painting the meerkat enclosure. ""I'm keen to get some social projects going, get local people involved with the zoo,"" he said. ""Lots of the animals here were rescued - either from other zoos or from owners who they'd got too big for. The leopard used to belong to an Indian prince, but once he started showing an inclination to eat his owner, he gave him to the zoo. ""He's so used to being around people, he has trouble relating to other leopards."" He added: ""Our dream is to make it a sanctuary for people as well as animals""."
2017-08-06,The UN Security Council has unanimously backed a new resolution imposing fresh sanctions on North Korea in retaliation for its controversial nuclear programme.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170806143415/http://news.sky.com/story/new-un-sanctions-aim-to-deprive-north-korea-of-1bn-in-revenue-10976338,"Among the sweeping measures is an export ban aimed at depriving Pyongyang of $1bn (£767m) in annual revenue - around a third of its export earnings. Kim Jong-un's regime will be banned from selling coal, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore, fish and seafood. The resolution also prevents the country from increasing the number of workers it sends overseas - whose earnings are another source of revenue for the regime. It prohibits countries starting new joint ventures with the North and any fresh investment in current joint ventures. Nine officials and the country's main foreign exchange bank have also been added to the UN sanctions blacklist. But there will not be the cuts to oil deliveries initially proposed by the US - a move which would have dealt a serious blow to the economy. The Security Council has already imposed six rounds of sanctions that have failed to halt North Korea's drive to improve its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities. US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said penalties against the regime have now been taken ""to a whole new level"" and the Security Council had put the leader ""on notice"". She said: ""This is the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation."" The US has been putting pressure on China, which accounts for 90% of the North's trade, to enforce the sanctions. The effectiveness of the new measures will be mostly down to whether Bejing cooperates. China and Russia had resisted the US clampdown, arguing dialogue with the North was the best way to persuade Pyongyang to halt its military ambitions. North Korea launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on 4 July which was followed by a second test on 28 July, and there are fears its missiles could reach the US west coast."

Police said she was injected with an anaesthetic when she arrived at a Milan apartment, put inside a suitcase and taken in the boot of a car to a village in the Piedmont region. Lukasz Pawel Herba, 30, who authorities say is Polish but lives in Britain, has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping for extortion purposes. ""Attacked, drugged, handcuffed and closed inside a suitcase, that's how a 20-year-old English model was kidnapped on July 11 in Milan to be sold to the best offer on pornography sites,"" said a statement from Milan police. They said she was handcuffed to a dresser until she was released near the British consulate on 17 July - with the kidnapping suspect arrested the day after. Her kidnapper allegedly threatened to auction her on the internet while trying to extort €300,000 (£270,000) from her agent. Police said no one took part in auction and it was unclear if Herba was serious about the plan or whether he was a ""fantasist"". The woman was released when the man discovered she had a child, according to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, but police said it was unclear why she was freed. Police are searching for any accomplices. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: ""We have been providing consular support to a British woman in Italy and are in touch with local authorities."""

The newspaper said this would constitute a down payment on a sum which would total €40bn. Last week, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel suggested the total bill could be €54bn. But the article suggests Britain may be prepared to offer a compromise allowing the two sides to move close to discussing the contours of a future trading relationship. However, a senior government source told Sky News that the report was ""not correct at all"". They said they had ""no idea"" where the speculation had come from. Downing Street refused to make any official comment while pointing out negotiations are ongoing. The EU is insisting ""sufficient progress"" must be made on the financial settlement, the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British citizens in the EU, together on border issues with Ireland, before talks can progress. The UK Government has acknowledged it will work towards a ""fair settlement"" on its ""rights and obligations as a departing member state""."

Mr Sessions said the Trump administration is determined to tackle ""the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country"". He told reporters that the number of investigations into leaks of sensitive information has trebled since Mr Trump took office, and four people have already been charged. Anger in the White House about leaks has been growing of late. The Washington Post has published embarrassing transcripts of conversations the President held with the leaders of Mexico and Australia back in January. According to the transcripts, Mr Trump told President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the border wall between the two countries. The newspaper also reported details of another heated phone call which Mr Trump held with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on 28 January, in which the President described their conversation as ""ridiculous"". Both men argued over an agreement in which the US accepts refugees from Australian detention centres on Papua New Guinea, with Mr Trump losing his temper and saying: ""I have had it.""

A packed crowd at the London Stadium booed Gatlin before the race, but were quietened when he crossed the line in 9.92 seconds. Black told Sky News there was a strong sense of ""disappointment, disillusion, and really disbelief by the crowd"" and that it was a ""difficult, awkward moment"" for the sport. ""The one thing the sport didn't want was Justin Gatlin, a convicted drugs cheat, twice in the sport, to end Usain Bolt's career by beating him,"" said Black, who won fifteen medals for Great Britain during his athletics career. ""In many ways Usain Bolt has carried the sport over the last few years throughout the whole drug issue that's been going on. ""This won't really affect Usain Bolt, he's still the greatest of all time. ""There will be a degree of respect from Usain Bolt for Gatlin as a competitor. The bigger issue is for the sport."" Bolt is an eight-time Olympic gold medallist and eleven-time World Champion. He also holds the world record for the 100m sprint of 9.58 seconds, which he ran in Berlin in 2009. Bolt himself was more forgiving of Gatlin's transgressions. ""He's done his time,"" he said after the race. ""I know that if I don't show up, he's always going to win - and tonight he showed up. He was the better man tonight."" Black narrowly missed out on a gold medal 20 years ago at the 1997 World Championships, when the USA beat Great Britain in the 4x400m relay by 0.18 seconds. The US quartet was subsequently disqualified when one of its athletes, Antonio Pettigrew, admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Great Britain was retrospectively awarded the gold, although Black still has not received his medal."

As the chairman begins to compile his terms of reference, here are six questions people want answered. 1. Why did a small fire in a fridge spread so quickly and why were so many people not able to escape?  A thorough understanding of forensic details on how the fire spread, and of the catastrophic failure of the measures in place to keep people safe, are the most pressing issues. 2. How could this happen in a building refurbished in 2016, at a cost of £10m and approved and signed off by one of London's wealthiest boroughs?  Every aspect of the building will be examined, from its original design to subsequent alterations and the latest refurbishment. 3. What documentary evidence can be found to show who was responsible for crucial aspects of the building's design and construction, and whether they did they did their jobs properly?  Chancellor Philip Hammond controversially claimed that the combustible polyethylene cladding attached to the outside of the building is banned in the UK, but the inquiry will want to look at other issues too, including the polyisocyanurate insulation panels that released deadly hydrogen cyanide gas as they burned. 4. Where were building control officers and the Government's fire investigators and safety advisers while tower blocks across the country were being covered in material that burns but was passed as fire safe?  Last year, the Government was assured by its advisers BRE Global that regulations were ""adequate"" to keep people safe. Now, the Prime Minister has said an investigation into the problem will need to look back decades. Failures in building control are potentially the most far-reaching issues to tackle. 5. Who is responsible?  As high-rise buildings across the country are stripped of their cladding following Government-ordered emergency tests, the construction industry - and the officials who regulate, advise and test its products - are all under pressure. 6. When will it end?  The Government has said it wants some answers soon, and it is thought an interim report could come out this summer. But the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war shows how public inquiries can get bogged down when those who face criticism are given the opportunity to respond before publication. With the UK construction industry worth more than £100bn a year and supporting around three million jobs - and the likelihood that Government advisers and departmental decisions will come under scrutiny - the emotional, financial and political stakes could not be higher."

Very young children spend more than eight hours a week online, and 12 to 15-year-olds are on the internet for more than 20 hours a week, according to the commissioner. Ms Longfield told Sky News: ""I get told about parents whose children at airports are going frantic because they're worried about not being online for that couple of hours in the air. ""Ultimately it's about helping children to manage their time online, bringing down levels of anxiety and not leaving them at the mercy of those media giants who are, after all, looking to get them engaged and get them involved."" The campaign is based on the NHS' five steps to better mental health, which have been adapted to a digital context. The ""digital five-a-day"" are: Connect to enable children to keep in touch but be mindful of privacy settings. Be active and have time to switch off and get moving. Get creative and learn video or coding skills, instead of just spending time online passively. Give to others such as positive feedback or reporting negative behaviours of others. Be mindful of how how the desire to constantly be online makes them feel. The campaign encourages parents to keep a note of how much time is being spent online. However, Ms Longfield says it does not have to be about restriction and control - which are unlikely to work - but rather finding a good way to be online, together with your child."

Ministers want the country to have the lowest energy costs in Europe for households and businesses. But earlier this week there was anger when British Gas said it was putting up electricity prices by 12.5% for 3.1 million customers. The review, headed by Oxford University professor Dieter Helm, will investigate key factors affecting bills, including energy and carbon pricing, efficiency measures and regulation. He said: ""My review will be independent and sort out the facts from the myths about the cost of energy, and make recommendations about how to more effectively achieve the overall objectives."" It will look for ways of reducing costs and consider how moving to electric vehicles and developments in storing energy, robotics and artificial intelligence will affect the industry. Extending the scope for auctions in the energy market will also be investigated along with making the supply chain less complex. But the study will not examine whether there should be a cap on price rises for 17 million households - a Tory pre-election commitment watered down after Theresa May lost her Commons majority. The Government has said it is taking action to cut bills and has asked energy regulator Ofgem for proposals to extend price protection to more people on the poorest value tariffs. By 2050, the UK is legally obliged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said: ""The review will consider how we can take advantage of changes to our power system and new technologies to ensure clean, secure and affordable supplies over the coming decades."" Alex Neill from consumer group Which? said: ""It is right to look at how to keep costs down, but yet another review is going to be cold comfort to the millions overpaying on their energy bills right now. ""Consumers need to see urgent action from the Government and regulator to tackle the lack of competition in the market and to ensure they are getting a good deal."""

2017-08-06,"Fifteen billion pounds. For those of you who've lived through the past decade - crisis after crisis, of governments routinely spending enormous amounts to bail out their banks - that might not sound like a lot of money.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170806143415/http://news.sky.com/story/the-15bn-stimulus-the-bank-does-and-doesnt-want-10972127,"But, for what it's worth, it amounts to about £550 for every household in the country. It's equivalent to a 3p one-off income tax cut. :: Bank issues pay warning and cuts growth forecast as rates held It would finance the construction of Britain's two new (monumentally expensive) aircraft carriers, and still leave change for three more. So the fact that the Bank of England announced today that it would electronically print an extra £15bn of money to pour into Britain's financial system is not without consequence. But if the Bank gets its way you're unlikely to hear much about this in the press. That's because this £15bn is going into one of the most technical, abstruse schemes the Bank has ever devised. The Term Funding Scheme was established in the wake of last year's Brexit vote, to encourage banks to lend more cash to consumers and to pass on lower interest rates to households. In short, the Bank was worried that with interest rates at historic lows, high street lenders (whose business models rely on making a turn on their loans) would fail to pass on the rate cut to consumers. So the BoE promised to lend those banks money - and lots of it - if they lent it on to their customers. And where did the BoE get that money? It printed it. Over the past year, the Bank has printed more than £78bn of cash and lent it to Britain's banks to encourage them to lend. While this is subtly different to the quantitative easing scheme in some senses (under QE the Bank printed money to buy assets; in the TFS it prints money to lend to banks temporarily, taking collateral in exchange), in other senses it is similar. For one thing, it involves a sharp increase in the size of the Bank's balance sheet. After this increase the total size of the Asset Purchase Facility (basically all the money the Bank has printed) will rise from £545bn to £560bn. For another, it acts as a stimulus for the economy. It won't have escaped your attention that over the past few months a number of economists (including, ironically, some at the Bank), have sounded the alarm over rising rates of consumer debt. Well, the chances are a good chunk of that lending has been encouraged by this BoE scheme. Lo and behold, the Bank has now announced that as things stand, consumer lending is increasing at such a rate that by the time the TFS comes to the end of its life, next February, it will have breached the £100bn total the Bank expected from it. That left the Bank with two choices: increase the total amount going into the TFS, or shorten its life. It chose the former. In some senses, that was the easy decision. It is not for the Monetary Policy Committee to intervene in the financial system (there is a difference). That is the job of another part of the Bank - the Financial Policy Committee. But it does leave us in an interesting situation. It is quite plausible the FPC introduces some checks and constraints on lending in the coming months. So the Bank would effectively be pressing the accelerator and the brake pedal at one and the same time."

And what's a few silly photos? We can always remove them, or make them vanish, thanks to privacy controls. :: Google and Facebook could be fined billions under new law So the Government's Data Protection Bill, under which anyone can ask for personal information to be deleted, a ""right to be forgotten"", might seem like something nice, but niche. I wonder if we realise how much dirt the social networks actually have on us. It's not just photos and status updates - the information we consciously hand over. If you're a WhatsApp user, it knows your phone and, a lot of the time, it knows your location. It knows what news stories you like, which adverts you've clicked on. It knows which of your Facebook friends - or Instagram followers - you fancy. Facebook is ubiquitous around the internet so its shares buttons appear on news sites, or are used for ID. It follows you around the internet, tracking your every click. It then combines that information it gathers with third party sources like Experian, which builds up consumer profiles based on credit card spending and other sources. As John Lanchester writes in the London Review of Books: ""What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business."" But the same goes for all the tech giants - they're very, very thirsty for your personal information. So the right to be forgotten is something quite profound. First, you have the right to know what Facebook knows about you, not just what you've uploaded, but the conclusions that the company has drawn, then sold on to advertisers trying to sway you. Then you'll have the right for that information to be removed. That could represent a shift in our relation to the digital platforms that control much of the modern world. It will rely on people taking it up of course. You can already ask any company for the data it holds about you, for a £10 fee, under something called a Subject Access Request. Few do. (Even though you can find out how attractive, say, Tinder thinks you are.) The impulse here isn't a Luddite one. Data is becoming the fuel of the AI-based economy, the coal to the steam engines of a new industrial revolution. By giving consumers control of their data, it means businesses can be more confident in how they use it. Rather than pushing the boundaries of people's privacy, they know the data they do process is there by consent - and safe to use. That feeds into another part of the bill: making sure data can flow freely. This is crucial to the economy and something that might have been threatened by Brexit. That also illustrates another point. The Data Protection Bill is pretty much identical to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has to be, to ensure the flow of data. The GDPR also contains the ""right to erasure"", the right to be forgotten. It's been in the works since 2012 and has been more or less ignored by the mainstream media and general public.When a law is promulgated from Brussels, it's boring, bureaucratic meddling. When the British Government announces the same thing, it dominates headlines and strikes a blow for freedom. We're again realising, a little late, that the wonks in Brussels might have been on to something."

It will place new requirements on companies about how they are allowed to hold and use data on ordinary citizens. :: How much dirt do social networks have on you? In the case of the most serious breaches of these rules, it allows the data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), to fine companies £17m or 4% of their global turnover, whichever is higher. The fines for the largest companies which use individuals' data to sell advertisements, such as Google and Facebook, could stretch to billions of pounds. Neil Brown, a solicitor at Decoded Legal, a law firm specialising in digital laws, told Sky News ""it was unlikely that the regulator will go anywhere near the top level very quickly"". ""Other corrective powers - including the power to ban a company from processing data - are likely to be the regulator's first port of call,"" Mr Brown said. The proposals include: :: Allowing people the ""right to be forgotten"" online :: Individuals can ask social media platforms to delete information they posted when they were children :: People must give explicit consent for personal information to be collected online :: People can ask for personal data held by companies to be deleted :: It will be easier and free for people to get organisations to reveal the personal data they hold :: New criminal offences will be created to deter companies from creating situations where someone can be identified from anonymised data :: The definition of personal data will be expanded to include internet cookies and IP addresses The law will also require social media platforms to delete information on children and adults when asked to, and will mean that default ""opt-out"" checkboxes will become a thing of the past. Where a company relies on people's consent, instead of people ticking a box to ""opt-out"" of their data being collected, they will now need to ""opt-in"" to give that consent. Mr Brown said that by outlawing 'consent by silence' and pre-ticked boxes, and requiring companies to separate out requests for consent from general terms and conditions, consumers should be far better informed about when, and for what, they are being asked for consent. Matt Hancock, minister of state for digital, said the law was designed to support businesses in their use of data, and give consumers the confidence that their data is protected and that those who misuse it will be held to account. Elizabeth Denham, who heads the ICO, said her office was ""pleased the Government recognises the importance of data protection"". The bill is designed to bring one of the EU's widely supported General Data Protection Regulations into British law, giving the Brussels-based law new footing in Westminster. Mr Brown said: ""Having a law which is consistent with the EU framework will be essential if Brexit goes ahead, so this announcement is very promising. ""However, questions are likely to be asked by the European Commission and others about the UK's surveillance powers and whether they afford sufficient privacy protections."""

But while many will welcome the much needed improvements to their service, they will be less happy about the reduced train service, longer journey times and station closures while engineering work takes place. Sky News spoke to commuter Ian Keith, whose home station in Norbiton is one of those being closed during the project. He said: ""I'm entering into my morning commute with trepidation. I think we're all expecting complete chaos."" Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne has previously admitted he is ""worried there will be challenging days"" and accepted that ""there are going to be days when the service is very difficult for people"". But while Mr Keith understands the need for the works, he's irritated by the lack of compensation and alternative routes covered by his annual season ticket, which costs him £1,600. He said: ""I understand why they are doing the work - running 10 carriage trains instead of eight will make it better for everyone. But the fact that you can only use your tickets to travel on permissible routes is unfair."" While he says he will follow South West Trains' travel advice during the disruption, he fears that ""there will be a meltdown and I'll have to jump on a bus and get on the tube at my own cost."" Adding to the travel chaos, in the midst of the engineering works, the South West Trains franchise will also change hands - moving from Stagecoach to First Group and Hong Kong-based MTR on 20 August. And while South West Trains have advised passengers to consider taking a holiday or work from home during the works, for many commuters this is simply not possible. Mr Keith said: ""There's just no way I can work from home. I'm putting work in my bag in case I'm left stranded, but that's about as much as I can do.""

I felt what I thought was pins and needles but maybe it wasn't just pins and needles. ""It sort of looked like hundreds of little pin holes or pin-sized bites distributed all over my ankle and the top of my foot.""

He added: ""We had a few people guessing that it was sea lice, but no one really had any ideas."" His father scooped some of the creatures out of the water and posted video of them eating small chunks of meat. Other speculation has blamed stingrays or jellyfish for the teenager's injuries. Jeff Weir, from the Dolphin Research Institute, said the likely culprit was probably opportunistic amphipods, tiny crustaceans that latch on to decaying plant or animal matter to help break it down. ""They are not there to eat us, but sometimes they might take a little bit, like mosquitoes and leeches and other things out there in the environment,"" he said. ""He must have been very, very cold and he wouldn't have felt it."" He added that the creatures cause injuries similar to a graze and the teenager should not be afraid of going back in the sea. Others pointed the finger at jellyfish larvae or stingrays."

2017-08-07,"Fifteen billion pounds. For those of you who've lived through the past decade - crisis after crisis, of governments routinely spending enormous amounts to bail out their banks - that might not sound like a lot of money.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170807151650/http://news.sky.com/story/the-15bn-stimulus-the-bank-does-and-doesnt-want-10972127,"But, for what it's worth, it amounts to about £550 for every household in the country. It's equivalent to a 3p one-off income tax cut. :: Bank issues pay warning and cuts growth forecast as rates held It would finance the construction of Britain's two new (monumentally expensive) aircraft carriers, and still leave change for three more. So the fact that the Bank of England announced today that it would electronically print an extra £15bn of money to pour into Britain's financial system is not without consequence. But if the Bank gets its way you're unlikely to hear much about this in the press. That's because this £15bn is going into one of the most technical, abstruse schemes the Bank has ever devised. The Term Funding Scheme was established in the wake of last year's Brexit vote, to encourage banks to lend more cash to consumers and to pass on lower interest rates to households. In short, the Bank was worried that with interest rates at historic lows, high street lenders (whose business models rely on making a turn on their loans) would fail to pass on the rate cut to consumers. So the BoE promised to lend those banks money - and lots of it - if they lent it on to their customers. And where did the BoE get that money? It printed it. Over the past year, the Bank has printed more than £78bn of cash and lent it to Britain's banks to encourage them to lend. While this is subtly different to the quantitative easing scheme in some senses (under QE the Bank printed money to buy assets; in the TFS it prints money to lend to banks temporarily, taking collateral in exchange), in other senses it is similar. For one thing, it involves a sharp increase in the size of the Bank's balance sheet. After this increase the total size of the Asset Purchase Facility (basically all the money the Bank has printed) will rise from £545bn to £560bn. For another, it acts as a stimulus for the economy. It won't have escaped your attention that over the past few months a number of economists (including, ironically, some at the Bank), have sounded the alarm over rising rates of consumer debt. Well, the chances are a good chunk of that lending has been encouraged by this BoE scheme. Lo and behold, the Bank has now announced that as things stand, consumer lending is increasing at such a rate that by the time the TFS comes to the end of its life, next February, it will have breached the £100bn total the Bank expected from it. That left the Bank with two choices: increase the total amount going into the TFS, or shorten its life. It chose the former. In some senses, that was the easy decision. It is not for the Monetary Policy Committee to intervene in the financial system (there is a difference). That is the job of another part of the Bank - the Financial Policy Committee. But it does leave us in an interesting situation. It is quite plausible the FPC introduces some checks and constraints on lending in the coming months. So the Bank would effectively be pressing the accelerator and the brake pedal at one and the same time."

The Cabmen's Shelter in Grosvenor Gardens in Belgravia, was built in 1906 for cabbies waiting at the ranks. The small, green structure, built by the Cabmen's Shelter Fund, is one of only a few remaining in the capital and is still in use today serving tea and breakfast to drivers. Underhill, an underground house built in 1973 by architect Arthur Quarmby in Holme, West Yorkshire, has also been protected, along with Stockton-on-Tees wireless station, built in 1912. The County Durham building is thought to have been the Royal Navy's only station capable of gathering intelligence at the start of the First World War. Pillwood House, a geometrically-shaped holiday home built in Truro, Cornwall, and Gothic-style funerary buildings at Willesden Jewish cemetery in north London have also been listed at Grade II. The process of giving a building listed status - therefore protecting it - started after the Second World War follow mass bomb destruction. The current list includes 710 windmills, 514 pigsties, 262 palaces, 16 plague crosses and even 13 dung pits. Powers to protect historic sites were established in 1882 but it was the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 which saw the start of the listing building system as we know it today. The Tower Gate at Lullingstone Castle in Kent was one of the first buildings to be granted listed status. It was built 520 years ago and has been in the same Hart-Dyke family ownership since then. Tom Hart-Dyke lives inside the Tower Gate and told Sky News what it's like living in a Grade I listed property. He said: ""It's cold during the winter! But it's fantastic, unique, quirky, different. ""But especially for us, the Gate House being in the same family for that long and still be here and living in the premises and still here is hugely exciting."" He said the fact his home is listed makes the mammoth job of maintaining it even harder. ""It means it can't be touched. When you do any work you've got to get permission for it,"" he said. ""There are stages in which the work is done. Because it's Grade I listed, it's known throughout the world. So the starring means you can't do a lot of work to it without permission."" Joe Flatman, from Historic England, is in charge of deciding which buildings get listed status and said the British public should be proud. He said: ""People should think of the national heritage list for England, this great record, as being the national archive of all of the best of our architecture up and down the country. ""From great palaces right down to the simplest of public houses, this list celebrates that diversity, that complexity. ""It's our national story in bricks and mortar."""

""We will not put our self-defensive nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table,"" it said, ""and will never take a single step back from strengthening our nuclear might"". The statement, carried by North Korea's official Korea Central News Agency, also threatened to make the US ""pay the price for its crime... thousands of times"". It said the UN sanctions would not force the country to negotiate over its nuclear programme or give up its ambitions and warned it would take ""action of justice"", although it did not elaborate on what that means. It comes two days after the UN Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions to punish Pyongyang, including a ban on coal and other exports worth more than £770m. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has ruled out a quick return to dialogue with North Korea, saying the new sanctions showed the world had run out of patience with Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. He said: ""The best signal that North Korea could send that they're prepared to talk would be to stop these missile launches."" Last month, North Korea carried out two intercontinental ballistic missile tests, with leader Kim Jong-Un boasting he could strike any part of the US. A White House statement said US President Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-In spoke on the phone on Sunday and agreed Pyongyang ""poses a grave and growing direct threat"". Mr Trump thanked Russia and China on Twitter for backing the new sanctions, adding he was ""very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions."""

The use of the tapes in Channel 4's Diana: In Her Own Words had already been strongly criticised by royal watchers before the broadcast. Rosa Monckton, one of Diana's closest friends, said showing the tapes was ""intrusive"", while royal author Penny Junor said she could not see ""any justification"" for airing them. Princess Diana's brother Earl Spencer had reportedly pleaded with Channel 4 not to broadcast them, for fear of the distress it would cause Princes William and Harry. But Channel 4 said it gave the Princess a voice and placed it ""front and centre"" in the run-up to the 20th anniversary of her death in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997. The documentary has divided opinion among TV critics with reviews ranging from ""trashy"" to ""heartbreaking"". Writing in the Daily Mail, Jan Moir said she thinks Diana would have approved of the tapes being aired and that they show her in a ""golden light"". She wrote: ""Actually, I think that Diana would love these videotaped sessions from 1992 being broadcast. Adore it! For the recordings show her in a golden light; rueful, amused, heartbreakingly vivacious and beautiful, noble in her obvious loneliness."" But she added: ""There is something heartbreaking all over again in seeing those familiar images; especially that footage of a beautiful girl in a golden carriage, riding off to her doom."" Writing for the Guardian, Mark Lawson said: ""The film is also manipulative, scored with a gloomy flute constantly telling the audience how moved to be. The editing is slick, but also often sly."" Andrew Billen gave the programme two stars out of five in The Times, and wrote in his review: ""Diana: In Her Own Words was pretentious and trashy. ""But within it wronged Diana, in her sweetness and confusion, lived again. If you could forgive the attendant ickiness, that apparition was worth gazing upon."" The footage, which was recorded on a camcorder at Kensington Palace in 1992/93 by Diana's speech coach, former Coronation Street actor Peter Settelen, contains deeply personal revelations. The tapes have been broadcast before - by US network NBC in 2004."

Anya Sizer, regional co-ordinator at Fertility Network UK, told Sky News there were ""massive discrepancies"" between areas in what amounted to a ""postcode lottery"". The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that the NHS should offer three full cycles of IVF for women under 40 who have not become pregnant after two years of trying. But just 27 of England's 207 Clinical Commissioning Groups, which decide on care by area in England, currently meet the criteria - a decrease of 46% in under five years. Some areas such as Bristol and south Gloucestershire have proposed to reduce the age women qualify for IVF to between 30 and 35. :: Computers beat scientists in choosing best embryos for IVF treatment And while in the London borough of Camden the NHS covers three cycles of IVF, in Croydon the treatment is no longer funded at all. ""There you have a distance of a few miles up the road and you have a completely different funding experience,"" Ms Sizer explained. ""That obviously affects your ability to try."" The situation applies only to England, as uniform policies apply to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In a statement to Sky News Croydon's CCG echoed those of other areas, explaining it faced ""severe financial pressures"" which had resulted in ""limited resources"". ""We have a duty to look at the entirety of health needs across the borough and this very difficult decision will help us prioritise front line services,"" it said. :: IVF risks 'may be too high for some couples' But Fertility Network UK argued that fertility treatments should be seen as a central component of national healthcare and highlighted the serious psychological problems created by a lack of access to IVF. ""You're talking about people who are going through the massive crisis of being unable to conceive, and adding another layer to that with finances,"" Ms Sizer said. IVF involves encouraging the production of eggs and inseminating them outside the body, before an embryo is transferred to continue with a pregnancy. An estimated one in six couples in the UK, about 3.5 million people, are affected by fertility issues. Croydon CCG said it would be reviewing the decision to cut IVF funding in a few years times. A spokesperson from the Department of Health said: ""Fertility problems can have a serious and lasting impact on families and the NHS should provide access to services, including IVF, for all patients that meet the criteria set out by independent experts at NICE."""

It is thought to have been used on chickens in Belgium and could be potentially dangerous to humans. However, the FSA insists the risk to public health is very low and the number of eggs affected is extremely small. ""The number of eggs involved represents about 0.0001% of the eggs imported into the UK each year,"" it said. ""Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned."" The FSA says it is urgently investigating and indications so far are that the eggs are no longer on sale. It added that the UK has already taken action to prevent risks to the public by adding fipronil to its robust surveillance programme in UK farms. Belgian officials said on Saturday they had kept the problem secret and failed to trigger the EU's international food safety alert system, but said it was because of a fraud probe. The country's agriculture minister said he had ordered its food safety agency to make clear why it failed to notify neighbouring countries until 20 July, despite knowing about the contamination since June. A criminal investigation is under way. A Dutch farming organisation has said that several million hens may need to be culled at 150 companies in the country, with 300,000 having already been killed. The World Health Organisation says fipronil is ""moderately hazardous"" and can affect people's kidneys, liver and thyroids. The FSA says 85% of eggs consumed in the UK are produced here."

Ms Ayling was then driven to a remote Italian farmhouse near Turin, around 120 miles away, and held her captive for six days until she was released on 17 July - reportedly after kidnappers discovered she was a mother. Police said her agent was told he had to pay €300,000 (£270,000) to stop the auction, hosted on pornographic sites on the dark web, an area of the internet where users with special software can communicate anonymously. Lukasz Pawel Herba, 30, who authorities said is Polish but lives in Britain, has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping for extortion purposes. The kidnappers claimed to be part of the 'Black Death' group and Herba had allegedly organised other auctions that claimed to be selling kidnapped women, according to Italian authorities. Now safely home, Ms Ayling told The Sun: ""I feared for my life, second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour."" Ms Ayling's agent told Sky News she had landed back in the UK today (6 August) and would be debriefed by UK authorities, and was also having counselling. Italian paper Il Giornale reported that Ms Ayling was told by her captors that she would be sold to someone in the Arab world, who would then feed to her tigers when they ""got tired of her"". No bids were placed in the auction and authorities said it was unclear if Herba was serious about the plan or whether he was a ""fantasist"". A West Midlands Police spokesman said an address in Sampson Close in Oldbury was raided on 18 July in connection with the investigation Italian police added that they were working closely with their counterparts in the UK and Poland."
2017-08-07,Supermarket giant Tesco has announced that it will no longer offer single-use plastic bags in its stores.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170807151650/http://news.sky.com/story/tesco-to-scrap-single-use-plastic-bags-in-all-stores-10977880,"The company had already begun charging 5p for the bags, in line with legislation introduced in 2015, and this has cut the number of plastic bags the store gives out by 1.5 billion. But Tesco says it still sells over 700 million 5p bags every year and has committed to reducing this number further. The company will discontinue the 5p carrier bags altogether from 28 August and instead offer customers a 'Bag for Life' at a cost of 10p per bag. The more expensive bags are made from 94% recycled plastic and will be replaced for free once they begin to wear out. The money made from the sale of the bags will be used to fund Tesco's 'Bags of Help' scheme, which awards grants to community projects across the country. The supermarket is also withdrawing its single-use wine carriers, and will instead lower the price of their reusable wine option from £1 to 40p. Online customers will still be able to have their groceries delivered in single-use carrier bags at the current charge of 5p per bag. Matt Davies, Tesco Chief Executive for the UK and Ireland, said: ""The number of bags being bought by our customers has already reduced dramatically. ""Today's move will help our customers use even fewer bags but ensure that those sold in our stores continue to fund thousands of community projects across the country chosen by customers. ""It's the right thing to do for the environment and for local communities."""
2017-08-07,Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that it will be lowering the level of a temporary price cap on prepayment meters which was first introduced in April.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170807151650/http://news.sky.com/story/energy-watchdog-ofgem-lowers-level-of-price-cap-for-prepayment-customers-10977763,"The move will mean a bill reduction of up to £19 a year for three million customers who rely on prepayment meters for their energy, following on from a £80 drop when the cap first came into force. Ofgem initially introduced the cap to help alleviate pressure on customers who pay up-front for their energy at a time when many suppliers were implementing significant price hikes. Prepayment meters are often installed when a household struggles to pay for their gas and electricity, meaning they can be most vulnerable to the impact of higher bills. When it was first brought in the cap enforced a maximum price for electricity, gas and dual fuel customers dependant on their region. The average cap was set at between £547.07 and £625.85 per year for electricity and £520.07 per year for gas, but this will now drop to between £528.28 and £600.13 for electricity and £519.74 for gas. Dual fuel customers will see their average cap reduce from £1,067.14 to £1,048 per year. The updated caps will come into effect from 1 October and the system will be assessed again in six months' time. Ofgem first announced the temporary cap in response to a two-year investigation into the energy market which found the Big Six suppliers were overcharging customers by up to £1.4bn a year. Prepayment customers were found to be among the worst off, as they had fewer tariffs available to them, and those were generally more expensive than those charged to regular billing customers. At the time, Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ""We want all consumers to enjoy the benefits of a more competitive energy market, regardless of their circumstances."" Since the cap was announced in February all six of the major energy suppliers have raised their prices for average bill-payers, including two separate hikes from EDF."
2017-08-07,"Brexit talks have not got off to a ""particularly promising start"", according to a former head of the diplomatic service.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170807151650/http://news.sky.com/story/top-former-diplomat-says-brexit-talks-have-not-started-well-10977855,"Sir Simon Fraser, who was the chief mandarin at the Foreign Office until 2015, said splits in the Cabinet meant it was hard for the Government to have a clear position. Sir Simon claimed the UK had been ""a bit absent"" from the negotiations with Brussels. Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said Number 10 ""disagrees strongly"" with Sir Simon's comments, adding talks have been ""constructive"" so far and ""important progress"" has been made. Much of the debate on Brexit in recent weeks has shifted to what a transitional phase before the EU divorce takes full effect should look like. Sir Simon said such an arrangement would be vital because there is ""no way"" a deal on Britain's future relationship with the EU will be finalised by the current deadline of March 2019. Sir Simon, who now advises businesses on Brexit and foreign policy, said: ""The negotiations have only just begun, I don't think they have begun particularly promisingly, frankly, on the British side. ""We haven't put forward a lot because, as we know, there are differences within the Cabinet about the sort of Brexit that we are heading for and until those differences are further resolved I think it's very difficult for us to have a clear position."" There are reports the Government is set to publish further ""position papers"" laying out its views on customs arrangements and the Northern Irish border soon, something Sir Simon said would help show the UK team, led by Brexit Secretary David Davis, is ""ready to engage"". ""I think so far we haven't put much on the table apart from something on the status of nationals, so we are a bit absent from the formal negotiation,"" he told Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4. ""I think we need to demonstrate that we are ready to engage on the substance so that people can understand what is really at stake here and what the options are."" A key issue that will need to be resolved in the negotiations is Brussels' demand Britain pays a so-called ""divorce bill"" as part of severing ties with the bloc. Many Conservative Eurosceptics have insisted the UK should not pay a penny, following a report the Government could be prepared to offer £36bn as part of the deal. The Sunday Telegraph said the Government will only agree to fork out the sum if the EU treats it as part of a deal on future relations. The EU maintains that talks on trade cannot get under way until sufficient progress has been made on the financial settlement, citizens' rights and Northern Ireland. But a senior Government source told Sky News the report was ""not correct at all."" Mrs May's spokesman maintained this line on Monday, telling a regular Westminster briefing the Government ""does not recognise"" the sum."
2017-08-07,"Investigations into abuse of mental health patients in the NHS have nearly doubled in three years, according to new figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170807151650/http://news.sky.com/story/abuse-of-nhs-mental-health-patients-endemic-10977609,"An analysis of NHS figures found abuse cases recorded by mental health trusts had risen from 106 in 2013/14 to 199 in 2015/16. Investigations into alleged abuse of child patients jumped from nine to 39 in a single year, the figures showed. The information was obtained by The Times newspaper through Freedom of Information requests. The figures come after a High Court judge, Sir James Munby, hit out at a ""disgraceful"" lack of provision available for a suicidal teenager. Norman Lamb, a former Liberal Democrat health minister, told The Times that force was used in mental health treatment ""far too much"". ""It's just intolerable - the trusts need to be accountable,"" he said. ""The use of physical force is endemic in the system. ""Abuse of patients on the face of it can be characterised as gross misconduct."" Reports of serious incidents require an investigation under guidance issued by the health service regulator NHS Improvement. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""If there are serious incidents where patient safety has been put at risk we expect mental health trusts to investigate immediately to ensure this doesn't happen again. ""Serious incidents remain rare across the NHS and our guidance makes clear restraint should only be used as a last resort."""

Government sources say some of those papers could be published in the next two weeks - ahead of the next round of withdrawal negotiations in the last week of August - providing the Cabinet can find common ground. ""These papers are meant to facilitate collective decision making based on facts and evidence,"" said a senior source. Position papers have been prepared on a range of issues from digital economy and data protection, to Northern Ireland, customs agreement and goods and services arrangements once Britain quits the European Union. No 10 hopes the position papers will unify a fractious Cabinet on an agreed position; counter the perception that the British Government is unprepared for Brexit; and ease the burden of workload on the civil service. ""I know there is a desire to narrow the set of options and that is coming from departments rather than DExEU. It is a lot of work to keep open five or six scenarios, so there is a desire to make some decisions now, regardless of negotiations,"" said one senior Government source. A Government source told Sky News ministers and officials have been working flat out to draw up the position papers, aware that the Brexit deadline is fast approaching. ""Position papers may determine whether or not we can move to the second stage of negotiations, work in recess is vital,"" said the figure. ""We never sleep."" The Government is planning a ministerial write round - where relevant ministers beyond the Cabinet are given sight of the position papers - for the week beginning 21 August, suggesting papers could be published from that week onwards. Britain and the EU cannot move onto talks about Britain's future relationship with the EU, the second stage of negotiations, until the European Commission is satisfied ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the top three priorities: citizens' rights, Britain's Brexit bill and the Irish border. The border issue is proving difficult. The Irish government has rejected a proposal from the British to use technology - cameras, pre-registered cargo - to avoid a hard border, and is instead pushing for the UK to join a new bilateral customs union with the EU. Mrs May's renewed focus on Britain's Brexit position comes after a chaotic few weeks, with her cabinet split over a possible transition period after the UK quits the European Union and what a post-Brexit immigration policy might look like. Chancellor Philip Hammond said in recent weeks there is now ""broad acceptance"" among the cabinet that a transitional period will be needed after Britain quits the EU and said ""many things will look similar"" for up to three years after leaving. That position is expected to be formalised in the position paper, with the government seeking a transitional customs arrangement to avoid a hard cliff edge for business."
2017-08-08,"Four in 10 maternity wards had to shut to new admissions in 2016 due to a lack of beds and staff, new figures suggest.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170808155245/http://news.sky.com/story/four-in-10-maternity-wards-had-to-shut-to-new-admissions-in-2016-10978861,"The Labour Party revealed the figures after a Freedom of Information request to hospital trusts across the UK. Of 96 trusts that responded, 42 said they had temporarily closed maternity wards to new admissions at some point in 2016. Some of the closures lasted more than 24 hours, the figures showed. Overall, units had to close their doors on 382 occasions, a 70% increase from 2014, when there were 225. In 2015, there were 375 instances. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures reflected the ""devastating impact"" of Tory underfunding. ""It is staggering that almost half of maternity units in England had to close to new mothers at some point in 2016,"" Mr Ashworth said. ""The uncertainty for so many women just when they need the NHS most is unthinkable."" Maternity services have been put under increasing pressure through a number of factors. An increase in birth rates has coincided with an increase in obesity levels, and the choice by many women to start families later. Uncertainty caused by Brexit over the future of NHS staff from the EU is also a concern, according to midwives. Sean O'Sullivan, of the Royal College of Midwives, said: ""Additional funding is needed in order to enable maternity services to employ the number of midwives that would mean they wouldn't have to be closing services as frequently as they are at the moment. ""But we would also like to see assurances from the Government that the midwives who are here from the EU can remain working here and also that it would be possible to continue to recruit midwives from other EU countries."" A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""We want the NHS to be one of the safest places in the world to have a baby and patients should be reassured we continue to have enough midwives in the NHS. ""Temporary closures in NHS maternity units are well rehearsed safety measures which we expect trusts to use to safely manage peaks in admissions. ""To use these figures as an indication of safe staffing issues, particularly when a number of them could have been for a matter of hours, is misleading because maternity services are unable to plan the exact time and place of birth for all women in their care."""

According to the Met Police, the woman suffered minor injuries in the incident, which happened at about 7.40am on 5 May. The jogger has been described as a white man with brown eyes and short brown hair who is in his early to mid-30s - and officers are urging anyone who recognises him to get in touch. Sergeant Mat Knowles said: ""The victim was put in extreme danger when she was knocked into the road. It was only due to the superb quick reactions of the bus driver that she was not hit by the vehicle. ""We are keen to speak to the jogger in the CCTV about what happened that morning.

The model, 20, who has posed topless for tabloid newspapers, went to Milan on 11 July for a photo shoot at what her agent Phil Green described as a ""recognised studio in the city centre"". But her lawyer, Francesco Pesce, said that when she arrived a man grabbed her by the neck while another injected her with a dose of the drug Ketamine which was ""strong enough to knock her to the ground"". Mr Pesce added: ""Then she was stuffed in a black sports bag like she was an object, and transported over winding, unpaved roads for more than two hours... bound hand and foot and with tape across her mouth."" Police in Milan said Ms Ayling was kept handcuffed to a wooden dresser at a rural house near Turin. A suspect in custody, Lukasz Pawel Herba, advertised her ""sale"" online, while also demanding a $300,000 ransom from Mr Green, according to police. But on 17 July, Ms Ayling was dropped off at the British consulate in Milan. The following day Herba, a Polish citizen with British residency, was arrested. Mr Pesce said police initially had ""more than understandable doubts"" about the model's story. He said: ""It seems incredible. A man kidnaps, together with others, a girl, and after a week, citing particular reasons, accompanies her inside a consulate ... (and) practically hands her over to police ""This at first was doubted by investigators but the story later turned out to be true."" The police, Mr Pesce and Mr Green have all given broadly the same account. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Pesce said Ms Ayling was ""told that she was going to be sold to somebody in the Middle East for sex"". She was also told people were watching and ready to kill her if she ""tried anything"", he added. ""So she abided to his request, 'let's go and buy groceries' and 'you need shoes, let's go buy shoes' and she didn't try to flee. But I believe she was terrified at the moment."" Mr Pesce described suggestions that Ms Ayling may have been somehow in on the kidnap as ""evil"". Ms Ayling's passport was taken by Italian police, who would not let her return to the UK until she had given evidence at a pre-trial hearing on 4 August, Mr Green said. Since getting back, Ms Ayling has made a brief statement, saying: ""I've been through a terrifying experience. I feared for my life, second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour. ""I am incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release."""
2017-08-08,"Since January there have been more than 17,000 recorded attempts by migrants to board UK-bound trucks and trains at the port and Eurotunnel in Calais.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170808155245/http://news.sky.com/story/migrants-in-calais-make-17000-attempts-to-reach-uk-in-2017-10978474,"This official figure by the France's interior ministry demonstrates that the demolition and closure of the 'Jungle' camp in Calais last October has failed in its attempt to stem the flow of migrants to northern France. The space which was once home to more than 10,000 has now been reclaimed by nature. Thick shrubbery covers what was once a waterlogged and muddy encampment. Next to the old Jungle, under a bridge carrying trucks to the port, one of the few reminders of the camp has yet to be cleaned from the concrete. 'London Calling', the graffiti says. Beside it is an image of Apple founder Steve Jobs. It is said to be one of Banksy's murals. It's certainly a political statement: a reminder that Steve Jobs was the American son of a Syrian immigrant. Beyond the graffiti, up the road towards town, you begin to spot them. The migrants haven't all gone; they have just moved into the woods where they quite literally live like animals. The numbers are not the same as they were a year ago, but nor are they as small as the French government might like to wish. At the weekend, the French interior minister, Gerard Collomb, said that there were ""about 350 in Calais"". He is wrong. It is clear from spending the past four days here that the number is much closer to the estimate by volunteers, who put the figure at near 1,000. It's hard to know for sure how many are here because they are engaged in a constant game of cat-and-mouse with the police. ""Tom and Jerry!"" an eight-year-old Eritrean boy shouts at me when he spots the phone in my hand. He is sitting with a five-year-old girl and her mother who tells me the group have been in the Calais area for over a year. They are in a minority. Most here are young men, many teenagers, who arrived in the last few months. I had played a cartoon on the phone to his friend the previous day. He'd remembered and now wanted to watch one too. Tom and Jerry was his choice. The police watched on in the distance. The sole objective of the authorities here in Calais is to prevent a new camp from taking hold. And so, almost every night, they disrupt the migrants; sweeps of the woods are common. Tents are already forbidden but tarpaulin and sleeping bags are cleared. Migrants are told, in a language they often don't understand, to move on. A recent Human Rights Watch report backs up allegations by migrants and volunteers that the CRS riot police are using brutal methods to disperse the new arrivals. Though I have not seen evidence of it, I have heard the same allegations every day here: that officers are beating the migrants with batons, firing pepper spray in their faces at close range and smashing their phones. There is only one focus for their day: food. Volunteers are permitted to provide a hot meal for the migrants twice a day. And so, under the buzz of the electricity pylons near the old Jungle camp, they gather at noon and again at 6pm. When the volunteers' battered old vans (these are grass-roots organisations not long-established charities) pull up, they run to be at the front of the queue. Among them is Osman Hotkhil from Afghanistan. He tells me he is a former commando in the Afghan army and has been in Europe for two years, legitimately trying to claim asylum in Germany. His predicament neatly sums up the problems for almost everyone here: ""I speak German very well and I went there. And after two years they told me 'your asylum has been rejected, you can go to another country.'"" He can't legally go to another country though - because like most here he stands little chance of asylum anywhere in Europe now that one country has already registered and rejected him. EU regulations state that all asylum seekers must lodge their asylum claim in the first EU country they enter - for almost all, that's Greece or Italy. And so, Osman and everyone else here knows that if they formally register with the French authorities and begin the two-year asylum claim in France, they are likely to be rejected and deported. Even if they want to stay in France, they know their chances are slim. As I finish talking to Osman, another Afghan approaches. ""I want to talk to you and tell you my story,"" he says. He's young; a teenager, no doubt. ""My name is Khalid Shah. I am 16,"" he tells me. He claims his mother is dead and his father is an Afghan-born British citizen living in London. ""My father, he is in England. He is British,"" he says. ""He want to support me here, legally. But I wanted to take a lawyer here but it doesn't work. ""That is why I came here now to Calais and try (the) trucks. But the people here, the police, say it's not legal. We don't have a future here but the UK government don't understand. ""Why didn't they take underage boys from here to the UK?"" Khalid says. Is he telling the truth? At this moment as I talk to him, I can't be sure. But the point is, there's no one official here listening to him; assessing him. Around the corner, a lorry pulls up at the petrol station. Suddenly the food is less of a priority. The migrants run towards the truck. It's broad daylight. As some climb the back, others look for hiding places underneath. The diver seems unfazed; he's used to it. It happens all the time. It doesn't take long for the police to arrive. We film as they detain one young man. The officers hold canisters of gas but we see no evidence of police brutality. The incident is short lived and the migrants return to their food. This reckless desperation is a daily occurrence and too frequently ends in tragedy. On Thursday night, a young Eritrean man was killed falling from a lorry. He had boarded it, assuming it was going to the UK. He jumped when he realised it was heading the other way, to Belgium, and was hit by a passing car. The following evening in a park in central Calais, a group of Eritreans gathered with some volunteers to remember their friend. The police watched on from a distance. Since 2015 more than 40 migrants and one Polish truck driver have been killed in these incidents. Numbered graves in the north cemetery in Calais are the only physical reminder of the loss. Back at the camp, another migrant agrees to talk to me but wants his identity protected. His family, back in Afghanistan, would be ashamed of his situation if they saw him, he explains. He says he has lived in the UK twice before but was deported both times. He says he doesn't know why they expelled him but he's back again for a third attempt at a life in Britain. ""Why not in UK? We like it there. We can speak English, we can live our life better. So why not UK? I guarantee after one month, or two months, I will be there. If they kick me out, I will try again. I don't care."" I ask what he was doing in the UK. Was he working? ""Of course. When you are living somewhere you have to work to eat. Or should I sit there with government benefits to eat? No, I don't like that,"" he says. As with everyone's story, it's extremely hard to know if he is telling the truth. Calais is a natural focus for Britain. But it is just a snapshot. It's the same at borders across the continent: move them on; hope they become someone else's problem. This week another attempt is being made by the French authorities to clear the migrants from around Calais and take them to processing centres. Some will go; some will hide. Many of those who do go will eventually return to Calais to join new arrivals who are travelling right now, north from southern Europe. Whatever your politics, this is a perpetual mess with plenty of suffering at its heart."

2017-08-08,"The Government will allow UK judges to overrule extradition requests by European Union nations after Brexit, according to a report.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170808155245/http://news.sky.com/story/british-judges-could-overrule-eu-extradition-requests-10979349,"Brexit Secretary David Davis plans to give judges the power to block the extradition of British citizens made under the European Arrest Warrant system, the Daily Telegraph said. The move is aimed at addressing concerns by eurosceptic backbenchers in the Conservative Party, it said. The arrest warrant is valid across the bloc and requires a member state to apprehend and extradite a suspect sought by another member state, in a system overseen by the European Court of Justice. However, the paper said the Supreme Court will be the ""final body of appeal"" for British citizens subject to a post-Brexit warrant. The report comes as the Government prepares to publish papers outlining its negotiating positions in the next two weeks, after the return of Theresa May from three weeks of holiday. A Government spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister has been clear that we will take back control of our laws and bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom. ""As part of the negotiations with the EU we will discuss with the EU and its member states how best to continue co-operation on security, law enforcement and criminal justice. ""The White Paper makes it clear that we will seek a strong and close future relationship with the EU on these issues. ""The EU has agreements with non-EU countries in this field to which direct ECJ jurisdiction does not apply."" Last month a report by the Lords EU Home Affairs Sub-Committee said Britain needs an arrangement on the European Arrest Warrant if it wants to avoid an ""unacceptable risk"". Meanwhile, the president of the Supreme Court, Lord Neuberger, has told the BBC that the Government should provide more clarity on the role of the European Court of Justice after Brexit. Ministers have said the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction will end after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. But they have also said that British courts should continue to interpret the European court's case law around legislation derived from the EU, on issues such as workers' rights."

The study, led by the University of Manchester, found there were 1.2 million more premature deaths in the North from 1965 to 2015 - and 14,333 more in 2015 alone. Their figures also reveal there were 49% more deaths among 35 to 44-year-olds in the North than the South in 2015, and 29% more among 25 to 34-year-olds. Lead researcher Professor Iain Buchan said: ""Five decades of death records tell a tale of two Englands, North and South. ""They are divided by resources and life expectancy - a profound inequality resistant to the public health interventions of successive governments. ""A new approach is required, one that must address the economic and social factors that underpin early deaths."" The researchers defined the North of England as the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands and West Midlands. Meanwhile, the South comprised the East, South West, London and South East. The study used data from the Office for National Statistics on the whole English population from 1965 to 2015. The full results will be published in the BMJ's Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.

He wrote to the space agency to explain: ""My name is Jack Davis and I would like to apply for the planetary protection officer job. I may be nine but think I would be fit for the job. One of the reasons is my sister says I am an alien also I have seen almost all the space and alien movies I can see.

New Look said underlying operating profit fell to £12.1m for the 13 weeks to 24 June, down from £30.5m in the same period last year. Like-for-like sales in the UK slumped by 7.5%. The company pointed to tough conditions on the high street as well as acknowledging that its offering had missed the mark in recent months. Profits were also squeezed by the collapse in the pound since the Brexit vote - pushing up the retailer's buying costs while at the same time it cut prices for key clothing lines. Chief executive Anders Kristiansen said: ""As expected, the UK market has remained difficult, which has resulted in a disappointing quarter of trading. ""Looking ahead, we expect the consumer economy to remain fragile and challenging market conditions to persist into 2018."" Mr Kristiansen said the company's product was ""not where it should be"", compounding the hit suffered from weak consumer confidence after the Brexit vote, and the drop in the value of the pound. ""It has been tough out there for most companies and that's what we have seen ever since Brexit, but on the other hand we don't think we have delivered as good a product as we could have,"" he said. The company is overhauling its clothing ranges and has hired Paula Dumont Lopez, who has held senior roles at Zara owner Inditex and Esprit, to become its new chief creative officer from next month. New Look, owned by South African investment group Brait, has 890 stores, including 593 in the UK. Mr Kristiansen said the group remained committed to a long-term strategy of reducing its dependence on the UK high street as it looks online and overseas for growth. It has just launched a new website and has been expanding its number of outlets in China. But Mr Kristiansen also said New Look ""believes very much"" in its UK store estate, with 98% of it profitable, though it is kept under review each quarter. Shoppers are being squeezed by accelerating price growth as pay growth stutters and the high street appears to be bearing the brunt. Figures published by Barclaycard on Tuesday showed a 3.5% increase in consumer spending in July but that households are prioritising supermarket purchases and the ""experience economy"" such as cinema trips over clothing, which saw spending fall. Separate figures from the BRC from the retail sector showed like-for-like sales rose 0.9% in July, down from 1.2% in June."
2017-08-08,"Women in England are being barred from accessing IVF treatment on the NHS in a postcode lottery created by cuts to the service, campaigners have said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170808155245/http://news.sky.com/story/cuts-to-ivf-have-led-to-postcode-lottery-in-england-campaigners-say-10978012,"Four areas including Croydon, Basildon and Brentwood now offer no funded cycles of IVF treatment, while 125 fund just one. Anya Sizer, regional co-ordinator at Fertility Network UK, told Sky News there were ""massive discrepancies"" between areas in what amounted to a ""postcode lottery"". The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that the NHS should offer three full cycles of IVF for women under 40 who have not become pregnant after two years of trying. But just 27 of England's 207 Clinical Commissioning Groups, which decide on care by area in England, currently meet the criteria - a decrease of 46% in under five years. Some areas such as Bristol and south Gloucestershire have proposed to reduce the age women qualify for IVF to between 30 and 35. :: Computers beat scientists in choosing best embryos for IVF treatment And while in the London borough of Camden the NHS covers three cycles of IVF, in Croydon the treatment is no longer funded at all. ""There you have a distance of a few miles up the road and you have a completely different funding experience,"" Ms Sizer explained. ""That obviously affects your ability to try."" The situation applies only to England, as uniform policies apply to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In a statement to Sky News Croydon's CCG echoed those of other areas, explaining it faced ""severe financial pressures"" which had resulted in ""limited resources"". ""We have a duty to look at the entirety of health needs across the borough and this very difficult decision will help us prioritise front line services,"" it said. :: IVF risks 'may be too high for some couples' But Fertility Network UK argued that fertility treatments should be seen as a central component of national healthcare and highlighted the serious psychological problems created by a lack of access to IVF. ""You're talking about people who are going through the massive crisis of being unable to conceive, and adding another layer to that with finances,"" Ms Sizer said. IVF involves encouraging the production of eggs and inseminating them outside the body, before an embryo is transferred to continue with a pregnancy. An estimated one in six couples in the UK, about 3.5 million people, are affected by fertility issues. Croydon CCG said it would be reviewing the decision to cut IVF funding in a few years times. A spokesperson from the Department of Health said: ""Fertility problems can have a serious and lasting impact on families and the NHS should provide access to services, including IVF, for all patients that meet the criteria set out by independent experts at NICE."""

In a series of Facebook posts since his escape, Australian convict Davidson has ridiculed police efforts to capture him - mocking up wanted posters and sharing images of his location. Celebrating his freedom on Monday, the 33-year-old posted: ""50 days tomorrow can I get a round of applause"". Days earlier Davidson posted a photo of seats on a plane, with the caption: ""Another day another country and check out my leg room hahaha enjoy life"". Last week he taunted Interpol with a Facebook message to the agency's Manila branch. It read: ""How's it going, when you say close how close are you really?"" The fugitive, who claims he has travelled to Amsterdam, Dubai and Germany, has amassed an online following with more than 1,000 people joining a Facebook fan page. The self-styled ""real life action movie star"" has been described by supporters as a ""legend"" and ""an inspiration"". In one of his most-liked posts, he photoshopped his face onto a poster for TV show Prison Break. At the time of his escape, Davidson had just 10 weeks left to serve of a year-long jail sentence for forging his identity. However, he also has an arrest warrant outstanding in Australia after he allegedly skipped the country while awaiting a court appearance. Two of his fellow escapees were captured at a luxury resort in East Timor two days after the breakout. The other man remains on the run. The breakout has prompted an increase in searches of cells at Kerobokan prison. ""I pity those who were on shift that time,"" guard Wayan Mudastra told The West Australian. ""(They are) the ones being questioned the most."""

But it says many companies are not using the Department of Health endorsed system, even though their products contain so much sugar they would attract a red label. The organisation found that manufacturers including Bear, Jordans, Kellogg's and Nestle do not use colour-coded labels. Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Honey and Nut Clusters - as well as Jordans Country Crisp with Crunchy Chunky Nuts - were among products singled out by the group. Action on Sugar said the absence of such labels makes it difficult for consumers to interpret the information and make informed decisions. Campaign director Katharine Jenner said: ""Shoppers should be seeing red, and they would be if manufacturers used the correct labels. ""It's scandalous that certain food manufacturers are still refusing to be transparent when it comes to front of pack nutrition labelling. ""If there is no front of pack label with one brand, shoppers should assume they are hiding something - so buy another brand instead."" The group said that cereal shoppers could save themselves around 45 teaspoons of sugar per month (182g) if appropriate labelling was consistently used. The colour-coding uses red for high, amber for medium and green for low on labels to indicate levels of fat, sugars and salt. A spokesman for Kellogg's said: ""Kellogg's is committed to improving the nation's diet. ""Our long-term sugar reduction programme has already seen sugar come down in some of our biggest brands while removing 2,000 tonnes of sugar from the nation's diet by the end of 2017."""

He signed off NHS England's ""bespoke package of care"" for the youngster, known as 'X', which includes four weeks of treatment and a transfer to a new facility. But the judge said the outcome was ""not a matter for congratulation"" but ""concern"". The teenager cannot be named for legal reasons. Care staff had warned that sending her back to her home town would be a ""suicide mission to a catastrophic level"". In his ruling on Monday, Sir James said: ""The provision of the care that someone like X needs should not be dependent upon judicial involvement, nor should someone like X be privileged just because her case comes before a very senior judge. ""I emphasise this because a mass of informed, if anecdotal, opinion indicates that X's is not an isolated case and that there are far too many young women in similar predicaments. How are they to be protected?"" In an earlier hearing, he warned ""we will have blood on our hands"" if appropriate care was not found for the teenager, who was due to be released from her secure unit - despite multiple suicide attempts. Campaigners hailed the judge's intervention and called on the NHS to address a ""wider problem"". Andy Bell, deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, told Sky News: ""Too many children and young people spend long periods waiting for mental health support when they need it."" He said it underlined ""a wider problem in the NHS in providing for young people's mental health"". Mr Bell added: ""We urgently need to ensure that care and support are provided to the most vulnerable children - including those in the youth justice system - quickly when they are needed as part of a whole system of support for every young person who experiences a difficulty with their mental health."" NHS England's medical director for the north of England, Dr Mike Prentice, announced on Friday that after ""extensive assessments"" a bed had been found for X. Sir James said he hoped the young girl would be transferred to a new facility - known only as ZZ - on Thursday. ""If need be, and I very much hope that the need will not arise, there will be a further hearing later this week,"" said the judge."

Justice Secretary accepted a Parole Board recommendation.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170808155245/http://news.sky.com/story/road-rage-killer-kenneth-noye-moving-to-open-prison-10979107,"Noye, 70, was convicted of murder after stabbing 21-year-old electrician Stephen Cameron to death in an attack on the M25 in Kent in 1996. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 16 years in 2000. Last month the Parole Board recommended that he be transferred to ""open conditions"", but stopped short of advising authorities to release him. The final decision lay with the Ministry of Justice, which has confirmed that Justice Secretary David Lidington had accepted the recommendation. An MoJ spokesman said: ""Public protection is our top priority and transfers to open conditions are made after a thorough, expert risk assessment carried out by the independent Parole Board."" In granting Noye's request, Mr Lidington has overturned an earlier refusal by then-Justice Secretary Michael Gove, who blocked the board's recommendation that Noye be moved to an open jail in 2015. That prompted Noye to launch a successful High Court challenge against the refusal decision earlier this year, which his counsel argued was ""unlawful and irrational"". After killing Mr Cameron, Noye fled to Spain, but was tracked down to a villa in Andalucia and extradited in 1998. At his trial he admitted wielding the knife but claimed he had acted in self-defence in a fight with Mr Cameron. The jury found him guilty of murder by a majority of 11-1. He lost appeals against his conviction in 2001 and 2011. One of Britain's most notorious criminals, Noye specialised in gold and had been jailed for handling bullion stolen in the infamous 1983 Brink's-Mat warehouse heist at Heathrow airport. ""I hope you all die of cancer,"" he shouted at the jury after an 11-week trial at the Old Bailey in 1986. He was jailed for 14 years and fined £500,000 plus £200,000 costs but was released two years before the M25 attack. In 1985, 11 years before murdering Mr Cameron, Noye stabbed police officer John Fordham 10 times after confronting the detective constable, who was investigating Noye's links to the robbery, at his house in Kent. A jury acquitted him of murder or manslaughter on the grounds of self-defence."

And what's a few silly photos? We can always remove them, or make them vanish, thanks to privacy controls. :: Google and Facebook could be fined billions under new law So the Government's Data Protection Bill, under which anyone can ask for personal information to be deleted, a ""right to be forgotten"", might seem like something nice, but niche. I wonder if we realise how much dirt the social networks actually have on us. It's not just photos and status updates - the information we consciously hand over. If you're a WhatsApp user, it knows your phone and, a lot of the time, it knows your location. It knows what news stories you like, which adverts you've clicked on. It knows which of your Facebook friends - or Instagram followers - you fancy. Facebook is ubiquitous around the internet so its shares buttons appear on news sites, or are used for ID. It follows you around the internet, tracking your every click. It then combines that information it gathers with third party sources like Experian, which builds up consumer profiles based on credit card spending and other sources. As John Lanchester writes in the London Review of Books: ""What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business."" But the same goes for all the tech giants - they're very, very thirsty for your personal information. So the right to be forgotten is something quite profound. First, you have the right to know what Facebook knows about you, not just what you've uploaded, but the conclusions that the company has drawn, then sold on to advertisers trying to sway you. Then you'll have the right for that information to be removed. That could represent a shift in our relation to the digital platforms that control much of the modern world. It will rely on people taking it up of course. You can already ask any company for the data it holds about you, for a £10 fee, under something called a Subject Access Request. Few do. (Even though you can find out how attractive, say, Tinder thinks you are.) The impulse here isn't a Luddite one. Data is becoming the fuel of the AI-based economy, the coal to the steam engines of a new industrial revolution. By giving consumers control of their data, it means businesses can be more confident in how they use it. Rather than pushing the boundaries of people's privacy, they know the data they do process is there by consent - and safe to use. That feeds into another part of the bill: making sure data can flow freely. This is crucial to the economy and something that might have been threatened by Brexit. That also illustrates another point. The Data Protection Bill is pretty much identical to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has to be, to ensure the flow of data. The GDPR also contains the ""right to erasure"", the right to be forgotten. It's been in the works since 2012 and has been more or less ignored by the mainstream media and general public.When a law is promulgated from Brussels, it's boring, bureaucratic meddling. When the British Government announces the same thing, it dominates headlines and strikes a blow for freedom. We're again realising, a little late, that the wonks in Brussels might have been on to something."

""We successfully breached into your huge network,"" the video said, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which together with other online magazines received the confidential information in an email from the hackers. ""HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded (it took about 6 months)."" The hackers instructed Mr Plepler to pay a ransom of ""our six-month salary in bitcoin"", claiming they earned $12m to $15m (£9m-£11m) from blackmailing other organisations, to prevent further releases. The video followed a file dump which included the script to an upcoming Game Of Thrones episode and a month's worth of emails from an HBO programming executive. This is the second major HBO leak by the same hackers. Last month, 1.5 terabytes of data including scripts from GOT, episodes from popular TV shows Ballers and new comedy Room 104, were stolen and released. HBO issued a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, saying: ""HBO believed that further leaks might emerge from this cyber incident when we confirmed it last week. As we said, the forensic review is ongoing. ""While it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised."" Although this may constitute HBO's biggest leak to date, it falls short of the cyberattack inflicted on Sony in 2014, when hackers released thousands of personal emails and information including salaries and social security numbers belonging to nearly 50,000 past and present employees."
2017-08-08,"Fifteen billion pounds. For those of you who've lived through the past decade - crisis after crisis, of governments routinely spending enormous amounts to bail out their banks - that might not sound like a lot of money.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170808155245/http://news.sky.com/story/the-15bn-stimulus-the-bank-does-and-doesnt-want-10972127,"But, for what it's worth, it amounts to about £550 for every household in the country. It's equivalent to a 3p one-off income tax cut. :: Bank issues pay warning and cuts growth forecast as rates held It would finance the construction of Britain's two new (monumentally expensive) aircraft carriers, and still leave change for three more. So the fact that the Bank of England announced today that it would electronically print an extra £15bn of money to pour into Britain's financial system is not without consequence. But if the Bank gets its way you're unlikely to hear much about this in the press. That's because this £15bn is going into one of the most technical, abstruse schemes the Bank has ever devised. The Term Funding Scheme was established in the wake of last year's Brexit vote, to encourage banks to lend more cash to consumers and to pass on lower interest rates to households. In short, the Bank was worried that with interest rates at historic lows, high street lenders (whose business models rely on making a turn on their loans) would fail to pass on the rate cut to consumers. So the BoE promised to lend those banks money - and lots of it - if they lent it on to their customers. And where did the BoE get that money? It printed it. Over the past year, the Bank has printed more than £78bn of cash and lent it to Britain's banks to encourage them to lend. While this is subtly different to the quantitative easing scheme in some senses (under QE the Bank printed money to buy assets; in the TFS it prints money to lend to banks temporarily, taking collateral in exchange), in other senses it is similar. For one thing, it involves a sharp increase in the size of the Bank's balance sheet. After this increase the total size of the Asset Purchase Facility (basically all the money the Bank has printed) will rise from £545bn to £560bn. For another, it acts as a stimulus for the economy. It won't have escaped your attention that over the past few months a number of economists (including, ironically, some at the Bank), have sounded the alarm over rising rates of consumer debt. Well, the chances are a good chunk of that lending has been encouraged by this BoE scheme. Lo and behold, the Bank has now announced that as things stand, consumer lending is increasing at such a rate that by the time the TFS comes to the end of its life, next February, it will have breached the £100bn total the Bank expected from it. That left the Bank with two choices: increase the total amount going into the TFS, or shorten its life. It chose the former. In some senses, that was the easy decision. It is not for the Monetary Policy Committee to intervene in the financial system (there is a difference). That is the job of another part of the Bank - the Financial Policy Committee. But it does leave us in an interesting situation. It is quite plausible the FPC introduces some checks and constraints on lending in the coming months. So the Bank would effectively be pressing the accelerator and the brake pedal at one and the same time."

He said ""the assumption that time online or in front of a screen is life wasted"" needed challenging and was ""driven by fear"". ""Gaming and social media can be as sociable as mooching around the streets with a group of friends,"" he argued. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: ""If you are spending a disproportionate amount of your holiday unsuccessfully attempting to separate your children from WiFi or their digital devices, do not despair. Your poor parenting may be helping them and saving the country. ""We need young people to explore this digital world just as they explore the physical world. ""We worry about being over-protective when they leave the house; we need to have the same debate about the balance of risk in the world of the internet."" Mr Hannigan, who stood down as the director of Britain's electronic surveillance agency in January, was responding to remarks made by the Children's Commissioner for England. Anne Longfield earlier this week urged parents to moderate their children's use of social media in the same way they limit junk food. She said very young children are on the internet for more than eight hours a week, while 12 to 15-year-olds spend more than 20 hours a week online. A new ""digital five-a-day"" campaign aims to ensure children are not left to use smartphones, computers or tablets without agreed boundaries, she said.But Mr Hannigan warned the country lacked the broad ""cyber skills"" needed now, never mind in the next 20 years. ""Traditional methods will not solve this. There are many excellent computer science and engineering teachers, but not enough,"" he wrote. ""Fortunately, today's young people have become good at learning through seeing and doing online. ""They are teaching themselves in new ways. It follows that the best thing we can do is to focus less on the time they spend on screens at home and more on the nature of the activity.

The future of Gibraltar, a rocky enclave on the southern tip of Spain captured by Britain in 1704, and its 30,000 inhabitants is set to be a major point of contention in Brexit negotiations. The EU angered Britain and Gibraltar in April by offering Spain a potential veto over the territory's future. It said no agreement on the EU's future relationship with the UK would apply to Gibraltar without the consent of Spain. But Mr Dastis told Spanish newspaper ABC: ""We will try to convince the Gibraltarians that (joint sovereignty) is a route worth exploring and that it would benefit them too. ""But what I don't want to do is jeopardise an EU-UK agreement by subjecting it to a need to alter Gibraltar's status at the same time. ""I won't make an agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom conditional on recovering sovereignty over Gibraltar."" The EU position caused fury in Gibraltar, where some accused Brussels of bullying. Former Conservative Party leader Lord Howard even suggested Theresa May could go to war to defend the territory. The Prime Minister has said Gibraltar's status is not up for discussion during withdrawal negotiations. Tory backbencher Bob Neill, a member of the all-party parliamentary group on Gibraltar, told The Sun: ""If this is a genuine shift in the Spanish position we welcome it. ""We in the UK want to have a good relationship with Spain after we leave the EU. And the people of Gibraltar want a good relationship with Spain too."" Gibraltar, which Spain wants back, voted strongly in favour of remaining in the EU at last year's referendum but is committed to staying part of Britain. Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo told Sky News he had had ""cast iron assurances"" from Britain's Brexit Secretary David Davis that the Government would not do a trade deal with the EU if it did not include Gibraltar."

""Past time for sensible MPs in all parties to admit Brexit is a catastrophe, come together in new party if need be, and reverse it,"" Mr Chapman tweeted. He also called Brexit ""the biggest calamity for our country since World War Two"", according to the Reuters news agency. Until May, Mr Chapman had a privileged view into Britain's exit preparations. He ran the office of Brexit Secretary and chief negotiator David Davis for nearly a year after the June 2016 EU referendum. He is also a former aide to former chancellor George Osborne, and worked on his campaign for Remain ahead of the Brexit referendum. Talk of a new political movement to gather anti-Brexit voices has been circulating for some time, with inquiries made about possible funding. Supporters of the idea are hoping a new party might emulate the success of ""En Marche!"", the French centrist political movement that catapulted Emmanuel Macron to the Elysee Palace about a year after it was founded. In a subsequent tweet, Mr Chapman appealed to Labour's Chuka Umunna, Stella Creasy, Rachel Reeves, Pat McFadden and Tory MPs Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Nicholas Soames as well as to Vince Cable. .@chukaummuna @vincecable @Anna_Soubry @NickyMorgan01 @RachelReevesMP @NSoames @patmcfaddenmp @stellacreasy I mean you 🇪🇺🇬🇧💔 https://t.co/IqurZViyZc Anti Brexit MPs like @Anna_Soubry @grantshapps @Mark_J_Harper have more in common with @RachelReevesMP @vincecable than @OwenPaterson et al The new Lib Dem leader, whose party has long called for a second referendum, tweeted: ""I agree with David Davis' ex chief of staff. The public should have a chance to exit from Brexit."" Mr Chapman, also a former political editor for the pro-Brexit Daily Mail, now works for a public relations firm. He has been critical of the PM in the past, telling Sky News she appeared to have been unable to keep her ministers in line amid squabbling in the Government. Mrs May lost her parliamentary majority - and much of her clout - in an ill-judged snap election in June. Amid criticism that the UK is unprepared for talks with the EU, the PM is expected to step up her Brexit efforts when she returns to Downing Street next week after the holidays."

One recent spruce-up of a stretch of the M11 motorway, between junction nine and junction six, resulted in 958 bags of rubbish being collected. But some campaigners feel nowhere near enough effort is being put in. John Read, the founder of Clean Up Britain, said: ""The reality of the situation is that the whole entire network is a litter hotspot. ""They need to do what they are statutorily required to do in law, which is to keep clean and clear the litter from all England's motorways. ""This is a real problem for us in this country because we rely heavily on tourism. ""At this time of year people come from overseas, arriving at our Channel ports and driving around the country. ""And they just see a terrible sight, which is litter festooning the verges and the lanes of England and this is something that needs to be done."" Mr Read called on Highways England to ""step up to the plate"" and ""do the job they are paid to do"". But Highways England pointed out that picking litter close to fast-moving traffic puts workers at risk - and instead urged drivers to simply take their rubbish home with them. A spokesman said: ""Clearing litter from busy roads such as motorways is a huge challenge, costing time and money which could be better spent on other priorities. ""Every year we remove about 200,000 sacks of litter from across our motorways, at the cost of around £40 per sack - the equivalent of fixing a pothole."" More than 7,000 sackfuls of litter have been removed from the 25 hotspots so far this year. The Government plans to launch its first ever anti-litter behavioural change campaign next year."

Profit before tax and one-off items was £157m, down from £348m the previous year, mainly due to higher costs and pay increases. JLR is owned by India-based Tata Motors, which reported a 42% rise in quarterly profits, mainly thanks to a one-time gain from changes to pension plans made at the British company. This one-time gain of £437m lifted JLR's pre-tax profits after one-off items to £595m, up from £399m in 2016. Dr Ralf Speth, chief executive, said: ""In challenging market conditions we are continuing to plan for profitable, sustainable growth. ""Our teams have been hard at work creating world-class cars in an unprecedented level of launch activity for Jaguar Land Rover."" Looking ahead, JLR said it wants to grow by investing more in new products, technology and manufacturing capacity. Investment spending this year is expected to be between £4bn and 4.35bn, including investment in a new Slovakia plant. The car maker said: ""Despite increased geopolitical uncertainty - for example, Brexit in the UK - economic growth in most major economies is continuing, although competitive conditions and incentive levels in the automotive sector have increased in key markets such as North America."" JLR's results come a few months after it announced it was boosting its 40,000-strong workforce with an extra 5,000 positions. The car maker said it was hunting ""the next generation of world-class electronics and software engineering talent"" through the creation of 1,000 new roles. The other 4,000 new jobs created include manufacturing positions - the majority of all the jobs being in the UK."
2017-08-09,The Home Secretary has said she supports the use of controversial stop-and-search checks to tackle acid attacks and knife crimes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/rudd-backs-use-of-stop-and-search-to-tackle-acid-attacks-10980758,"Writing in The Times, Amber Rudd said the powers had been abused in the past and should now only be used ""appropriately, with reasonable grounds and in a targeted and intelligence-led way"". Stop-and-search checks - a controversial tactic that critics say risks alienating black and other minorities by targeting them disproportionately - were overhauled three years ago by Theresa May, then home secretary. Under the reform, Mrs May allowed officers to stop and search people if they had ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect they are carrying items such as drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something which could be used to commit a crime. The use of the powers decreased in 2015/16, with fewer than 400,000 checks conducted by police in England and Wales. Ms Rudd welcomed the reform, rejecting the notion of a return to less targeted checks, but backed officers who used the tactic appropriately. She said: ""I want to be crystal clear - we have given the police the powers they need and officers who use stop and search appropriately, with reasonable grounds and in a targeted and intelligence-led way, will always have my full support."" ""This includes using stop and search to confront the use of acid as an appalling weapon of violence,"" she added, calling it a ""vital tool to keep the public safe"". Amid a spike in acid attacks in London, Ms Rudd signalled recently that convictions for such crimes could soon carry life sentences. The proposal was part of a wider crackdown against acid attacks. Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said her party supports ""evidence-based stop and search"" - though not what she called ""a return to the bad old days of discriminatory stops that focus on particular communities"". However, Ms Abbott said new powers would not make up for the cuts in police forces overseen by the Tories, and said a Labour government would ""recruit 10,000 extra police officers to help tackle violent crime and keep the public and our communities safe"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick wrote in the Times that the ability for officers to use stop and search was ""an extremely important power when properly used"". She said she wanted officers to ""feel confident"" using the power and stressed every check should be ""lawful, done courteously and subject to proper scrutiny"". She said: ""I will support my officers if the number of stop and searches rises in the fight against knife crime and street violence. I believe the vast majority of the public will too."""
2017-08-09,Tata Steel is within days of clinching a deal to detach its £15bn British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) – a move that could pave the way for it to merge its European operations with a German rival.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/tata-steel-on-brink-of-detaching-15bn-british-steel-pension-fund-10980801,"Sky News has learnt that the Indian steelmaker is aiming to announce on Friday afternoon that it has formally struck a deal called a Regulated Apportionment Agreement (RAA) with UK pensions bodies and the company's pension trustees. Under the terms of the RAA, a mechanism allowing a financially troubled employer to detach itself from defined benefit pension scheme liabilities, Tata Steel will inject £550m into the now-closed BSPS, which has roughly 130,000 members. It will also hand the scheme a one-third stake in the ongoing UK operations, which include the giant Port Talbot steelworks in Wales. Sources close to the talks, which produced an outline agreement in May, confirmed that The Pensions Regulator (TPR), Pension Protection Fund (PPF) and BSPS trustees were all preparing to make statements acknowledging the Tata Steel agreement. The stakeholders were hopeful of announcing a deal on Friday, although the timing remained subject to change, insiders said. After announcing quarterly results in India earlier this week, Koushik Chatterjee, a Tata Steel director, said the company was hopeful of reaching a final agreement with regulators and trustees ""shortly"". The signing of the RAA is expected to trigger the placing of the BSPS into the custody of the PPF, the industry lifeboat for members of defined benefit scheme. Members of the BSPS will then have the option of transferring to a new Tata-sponsored scheme, under which they would see lower future increases to their pensions than would otherwise have been the case. If they choose not to transfer, they would remain with the PPF. A source pointed out that for a small minority of BSPS members, staying in the PPF may offer a better financial outcome than transferring to BSPS2, as the new scheme has been dubbed. RAAs can be controversial because they are supposed to be approved by industry regulator only when ""the alternative would have to be that the employer would become insolvent"", according to guidance published on the watchdog's website. The crisis at Britain's biggest steel producer erupted last year, when Tata Steel put its entire UK operations up for sale amid a deteriorating industry environment. In February, the company's British employees voted to accept proposals to close the existing pension scheme to new contributions, in exchange for greater certainty about the future of its 8,500-strong workforce. Tata Steel said more than a year ago that it would seek to merge its European operations with the steel division of Germany's Thyssenkrupp. Doubts have arisen in recent weeks about whether the merger will proceed, however, even with a resolution of the pension issues. Sources also pointed out that the signing of the RAA would not be the concluding stage of negotiations about the future of the steelworkers' pensions, with a 28-day appeal period during which there can be a legal challenge to such deals. In a statement issued to Sky News, a Tata Steel spokesman said: ""After prolonged and intense discussions and negotiations with the BSPS, TPR and the PPF, the key commercial terms of an RAA have been agreed in principle between Tata Steel UK and the BSPS trustee. ""This was announced on 16 May 2017. ""The RAA is subject to formal agreement by TPR and non-objection by the PPF, and the formal agreement of the individual entities who would be party to the RAA. ""These parties are in positive discussions and we are hopeful of reaching a final agreement shortly."" The Pensions Regulator, PPF and BSPS trustees all declined to comment."

During the trials, it was heard that Northumbria Police recruited a sex offender years after he drugged an underage girl and invited another man to rape her after he had done so. The convict, who can only be named as XY, was tasked to assist the force with its investigation into child sexual exploitation in Newcastle. Defending his force's use of an informant, Northumbria police chief constable Steve Ashman said he would ""not rule out"" using a convicted rapist to aid an investigation again. He said ""we have safeguarded vulnerable women and girls"" and ""dangerous men are behind bars"" because of the information gathered using the convicted rapist. Mr Ashman said: ""We have to step into a murky, dangerous and shadowy world and the people who are going to provide us with that information which will protect victims - it's not the post-master or the district nurse."" He went on to say: ""We were absolutely entitled to do what we did. The question that remains is a moral one, was it right to do that."" Subsequent trials, which until now were unreportable, have heard girls were groomed by men who gave them cannabis, alcohol and the designer drug Mkat at parties, then encouraged them into having sex. Police said they found 278 victims and over the course of four trials 20 young women gave evidence. Those prosecuted were from the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish communities and mainly British-born, with most living in the west end of Newcastle. During pre-trial hearings, defence barristers argued the cases of more than 10 men should be thrown out due to the informant's involvement. Robin Patton, representing one of the defendants, said the public's confidence in the justice system would be ""substantially diminished"" if they knew police had recruited ""such an individual"". David Hislop QC, representing another defendant, said XY had 13 previous convictions, including 26 offences of dishonesty. :: Snouts and narks: The murky world of police informants It was heard that after his recruitment, the informant was arrested after a teenage girl claimed a man approached her and made an indecent proposition. He was later told he would face no action after he took part in an identity parade. During legal submissions, XY gave evidence to the court and made a series of lurid allegations against the police, including claims of racism and that he was asked to plant drugs. He claimed he was recruited because he acted as an informal taxi driver for some of the defendants and ""had to make it look like I was their friend"". Judge Penny Moreland rejected his evidence in its entirety, describing it as ""inherently unreliable"" and ""clearly dishonest"". Former undercover police officer Neil Woods, who used to recruit and pay police informants, described the method as the ""cheapest and most efficient way of solving crime"". He went on to say that ""the vast majority of informants are used for drug offences"", but only for robberies or sex crimes ""in rare cases"". Former detective chief inspector Chris Phillips, told Sky News: ""No officer would ever go into work thinking they were going to pay a convicted rapist money, but sometimes the needs are to get a prosecution, and you will only get that with enough information to put before a court. ""Countless lives have been saved by the use of informants, and if we have to pay £10,000 to get these people's locked up, I think its money well spent."" In a statement, the NSPCC said it was ""appalled"" Northumbria Police recruited a convicted child rapist as an informant. ""It beggars belief that it would ever have been considered, let alone approved, and serious questions must be asked about the force's approach to child sexual exploitation operations,"" it said. ""However good the force's intentions, their misguided actions run entirely counter to all current child protection procedures and what we know about sex offenders and could have compromised this investigation."""

He had been picked up that morning along with other children by a member of staff and was supposed to have been dropped off at one of the Academy's two centres in the area. The nursery worker returned to the other centre and did not realise the toddler was still in the vehicle, police said. ""We believe Myles was in the hot van all day long, since 9am,"" said Orlando Police Chief John Mina on Tuesday. Myles was eventually found at 8.30pm after his grandmother called police and the Academy demanding to know where the youngster was because he had not been dropped off at her home. Temperatures in Orlando reached 34C (93F) on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The staff member could face criminal charges if a post-mortem reveals he died from being left inside the hot vehicle. Mike Carroll, secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families, said it was investigating the death. Agency records show that during an inspection last month the Academy was found to have failed to have kept a log of pick-up and drop-off times, as well as details of where youngsters were being transported to. Both centres have reportedly been closed for the time being. Myles' heartbroken great aunt told the Orlando Sentinel: ""If you leave your child with someone, that person has the responsibility of taking care of them. ""If you have six kids get in the van, you make sure six kids get out of the van."" She said she was on the phone to Myles' grandmother when she found out what had happened to him: ""She started to scream, 'he's in the van, dead!'"" Myles, who was due to turn four later this month, is the fifth child to die in a hot vehicle in Florida and the 33rd in the United States this year, according to the website NoHeatStroke.org."

Sir Norman Bettison is charged with four offences of misconduct in public office relating to alleged lies about his involvement in the aftermath of the tragedy and the culpability of fans. Former Chief Superintendent Denton and former Detective Chief Inspector Foster are charged with perverting the course of justice relating to material changes made to witness statements. Mr Metcalf, the solicitor who acted for South Yorkshire Police during the Taylor Inquiry and the first inquests, is also charged with doing acts with intent to pervert the course of public justice in relation to witness statements. And Mr Mackrell is charged with two offences under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and one offence under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. The men appeared separately in the dock and spoke briefly only to confirm their personal details as the charges were read out against them. The only individual not listed to appear in court was David Duckenfield, the match commander on the day of the tragedy, who faces 95 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. The Crown Prosecution Service needs to lift a legal order imposed by a senior judge at the end of a private prosecution against him before it can proceed with new charges. The appearances follow a decision on 28 June by the CPS to bring charges against the individuals for the part they played in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool football fans died. The five men have been bailed and are due to appear before Preston Crown Court on 6 September."

One policeman was wounded by a stray bullet during the arrest, which took place on the A16 motorway near Marquise, close to the ports of Boulogne-Sur-Mer and Calais.

Six of a dozen or so troops were injured in this morning's attack - three of them seriously - in the Levallois-Perret suburb of the city. The incident is being investigated by counter-terrorism officials. The attacker had been waiting in the dark-coloured car in an alleyway before he drove at speed at the troops as they left their barracks to go on patrol at around 8am local time. Nadia LeProhon heard the smash and came running out of her building to find two soldiers on the ground and other troops running after a vehicle shouting: ""After him! Follow that car!"" Mayor of Levallois-Perret, Patrick Balkany, condemned the attack as ""an odious act of aggression"", adding: ""Without any doubt, it was a deliberate act."" ""It all happened very quickly. The vehicle did not stop. It hurtled at them... it accelerated rapidly,"" he told broadcaster BFMTV. Officers and soldiers secured the scene - situated around three miles from city centre landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower - as forensic teams arrived to gather evidence. Investigators were also scouring through CCTV footage from the suburb, as police stopped motorists in the region as they searched for the attacker. The Paris prosecutor's office said it was ""pursuing perpetrators on charges of the attempted murder of security forces in connection with a terrorist enterprise"". It means authorities believe the attack was intentional and planned with a terror-related motive. The soldiers, who were taken to a military hospital, were on duty as part of Operation Sentinelle, created to guard prominent French sites after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015. Sky's Europe Correspondent Mark Stone said: ""It is a subject of intense debate in France whether Operation Sentinelle - soldiers on the streets, helping out the police force - exacerbates the situation and they themselves become targets because they are literally everywhere, not only in Paris."" The attack comes four days after a teenager with a knife forced his way into the Eiffel Tower shouting ""Allahu akbar"" - the Arabic phrase for ""God is great"" - and told police he wanted to attack a soldier. It is the sixth time soldiers involved in the nationwide security crackdown have been targeted. In February, a man with a machete attacked troops near the Louvre Museum. French defence minister Florence Parly described Wednesday's attack as ""cowardly"", adding that it ""does nothing to dent soldiers' determination to work for the security of the French people"". France has been under a state of emergency since the November 2015 attacks in the French capital which left 130 people dead. Mr Philippe said that despite a ""high threat"" against France, the government is sticking to plans to lift the 21-month state of emergency on 1 November."
2017-08-09,"Officially they are known rather grandly as Covert Human Intelligence Sources, but to the rest of us they are snouts, grasses or coppers' narks.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/police-informants-where-should-line-be-drawn-10980924,"Especially to those who remember The Sweeney, the hard-hitting 1970s TV drama about the Flying Squad that often shone a light on the murky world of police informants. People give police information for a variety of reasons - for money, to remove a rival, or to get a cut in their own sentence. If an informant helps the conviction of others, police can give the judge a ""text"" - a letter - outlining the cooperation in expectation of a reduced sentence for their snout. It's become big business for the police, though it's a subject they are reluctant to discuss in detail. A recent Freedom of Information request revealed that UK forces spent £20m in five years on payments to informants. Most informants have some criminal past and one drugs squad detective I knew viewed anyone he arrested as a potential snout. Former Flying Squad detective Peter Kirkham told me: ""In broad terms you set a thief to catch a thief, but it's usually more complicated than that. If you want to know about criminality you need to get information from someone involved in that criminality."" When Mr Kirkham began his detective career 30 years ago there were few checks on how officers used informants. A detective kept the source secret and recorded no details of their meetings or payments. It was an unregulated system that was open to abuse, from both sides. The Scotland Yard investigation into the notorious 1987 axe murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan was condemned years later when it was revealed that a detective had ""coached"" his informant. In the 1990s the Yard was found to be using Jamaican Yardie gangsters as informants without realising they were carrying on their life of crime at the same time. The Yardie case led to stringent oversight of the informant system, with new rules and a code of practice. The latest Home Office guidelines set out strict procedures to be followed, especially on the use of juvenile informants. Yes, police are allowed to use children as their narks, with certain caveats. The Home Office guidelines say: ""On no occasion should the use or conduct of a CHIS under 16 years of age be authorised to give information against their parents or any person who has parental responsibility for them."" Is there a line to be to be drawn anywhere over the use of informants? Can anyone, whatever their past, be hired by police to help them convict other criminals? :: Child rapist paid £10k to spy on underage 'sex parties' An informant in the Newcastle child sex case, a convicted child rapist, claimed during a pre-trial hearing that Northumbria Police had paid him £10,000 for information about the sexual exploitation of young girls. He said part of his work included going to parties where police suspected girls would be intoxicated and sexually abused. Peter Kirkham said: ""I can't see any circumstances where somebody with his previous convictions would be approved as a participating informant to go to places where that sort of thing was happening. ""If the police had reasonable grounds to suspect what was going on they could not have allowed that to happen. ""It's not like me letting a villain steal a car for an armed robbery. In a case like that I would let the theft go ahead because it would lead me to a robbery where I could intervene and arrest more serious villains."" The Newcastle case is the biggest child sex investigation since the Rotherham and Rochdale grooming scandals and involved the trial of 25 suspects. Former North West chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who led the Rochdale prosecution in 2012, said: ""Putting a child sex offender in contact with children and other sex offenders is a line I would not cross. ""It is an ethical issue, but there is also the question of the danger to the children from someone who has already been convicted. My experience shows such men continue to offend. ""You need to be very wary. I can't think of anything that could be done to manage the very obvious risks."""
2017-08-09,"Fifteen billion pounds. For those of you who've lived through the past decade - crisis after crisis, of governments routinely spending enormous amounts to bail out their banks - that might not sound like a lot of money.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/the-15bn-stimulus-the-bank-does-and-doesnt-want-10972127,"But, for what it's worth, it amounts to about £550 for every household in the country. It's equivalent to a 3p one-off income tax cut. :: Bank issues pay warning and cuts growth forecast as rates held It would finance the construction of Britain's two new (monumentally expensive) aircraft carriers, and still leave change for three more. So the fact that the Bank of England announced today that it would electronically print an extra £15bn of money to pour into Britain's financial system is not without consequence. But if the Bank gets its way you're unlikely to hear much about this in the press. That's because this £15bn is going into one of the most technical, abstruse schemes the Bank has ever devised. The Term Funding Scheme was established in the wake of last year's Brexit vote, to encourage banks to lend more cash to consumers and to pass on lower interest rates to households. In short, the Bank was worried that with interest rates at historic lows, high street lenders (whose business models rely on making a turn on their loans) would fail to pass on the rate cut to consumers. So the BoE promised to lend those banks money - and lots of it - if they lent it on to their customers. And where did the BoE get that money? It printed it. Over the past year, the Bank has printed more than £78bn of cash and lent it to Britain's banks to encourage them to lend. While this is subtly different to the quantitative easing scheme in some senses (under QE the Bank printed money to buy assets; in the TFS it prints money to lend to banks temporarily, taking collateral in exchange), in other senses it is similar. For one thing, it involves a sharp increase in the size of the Bank's balance sheet. After this increase the total size of the Asset Purchase Facility (basically all the money the Bank has printed) will rise from £545bn to £560bn. For another, it acts as a stimulus for the economy. It won't have escaped your attention that over the past few months a number of economists (including, ironically, some at the Bank), have sounded the alarm over rising rates of consumer debt. Well, the chances are a good chunk of that lending has been encouraged by this BoE scheme. Lo and behold, the Bank has now announced that as things stand, consumer lending is increasing at such a rate that by the time the TFS comes to the end of its life, next February, it will have breached the £100bn total the Bank expected from it. That left the Bank with two choices: increase the total amount going into the TFS, or shorten its life. It chose the former. In some senses, that was the easy decision. It is not for the Monetary Policy Committee to intervene in the financial system (there is a difference). That is the job of another part of the Bank - the Financial Policy Committee. But it does leave us in an interesting situation. It is quite plausible the FPC introduces some checks and constraints on lending in the coming months. So the Bank would effectively be pressing the accelerator and the brake pedal at one and the same time."

The document, from the London School of Economics and the VATT Institute for Economic Research, found the rate of home moving would be 27% higher if the levy was completely abolished. At the moment, stamp duty costs £143,000 on a £2m property or £20,000 on a £600,000 home. Professor Christian Hilber, who co-authored the report, said: ""The key message of our paper is that stamp duty hampers mobility significantly. ""If you are a young family and you have an additional child, you'll need an additional room, but the stamp duty is discouraging this kind of move because of the additional cost and lack of available homes to move into. ""In a nutshell, the stamp duty discourages the elderly from downsizing and young expanding families from moving to more adequate larger housing."" One Cabinet minister told the Daily Telegraph the issue had ""a big implication in terms of economic growth"". In its manifesto at the last election, Labour Party promised a ""New Deal for first-time buyers"" that would cut up to 40% off the price of a home for people ""on ordinary incomes"", as well as giving a two-year holiday from stamp duty charges. ""Almost 90% of people want to own a home, but only 63% do. We reformed property taxes including stamp duty to help more people get on to the property ladder,"" a Treasury spokesman said. ""In addition, we are helping people - including young families - to buy their first homes through policies such as Help to Buy and the Lifetime ISA, and the recent £2.3bn Housing Infrastructure Fund which will free up over 100,000 properties in high demand areas."""

This latest reading was the weakest since March 2013 - however, different regions across the UK are experiencing different trends. House prices are continuing to grow strongly in areas such as Northern Ireland, the West Midlands and the South West. But prices are falling in London and the South East, the latter of which recorded its weakest reading since 2011. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, blamed recent tax changes and a lack of new homes after the financial crisis. He said: ""Sales activity in the housing market has been slipping in the recent months and the most worrying aspect of the latest survey is the suggestion that this could continue for some time to come. ""The flatter trend in price growth is arguably a silver lining but there is no real indication that the housing market will become materially more affordable any time soon."" During the previous two months, there has been a particular gap between the original asking price and the selling price - most noticeably in homes at the top end of the market. Two-thirds of those surveyed reported that homes marketed at more than £1m had sold for less than their original asking price. That figure was 57% for homes listed between £500,000 and £1m, while 37% of surveyors said homes listed at less than £500,000 had been sold below their original asking price."

It has threatened to withhold consent of the Great Repeal Bill, which will bring EU legislation into domestic UK law. London argues these powers could then be released under the Repeal Bill. Mr Russell said that, in its current form, the bill would give Westminster ""exclusive control over significant areas of devolved policy"", including farming, the environment and fishing. ""We know that the UK Government has its eye on more than 100 policy areas. That is a direct threat to the devolution settlement which the people of Scotland overwhelmingly voted for in 1997,"" Mr Russell said. ""Both we and the Welsh government have made it clear we could not recommend legislative consent to the Bill as it stands, and today we will make clear that changes must be made to protect devolution."" Mr Green said the UK Government was committed to dialogue. ""In some areas there will need to be a common approach. ""There will be other areas where I intend that the Scottish and UK governments can make progress in identifying policy areas that could be released to Holyrood under the new legislative arrangements. ""We expect there will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration and we want to address this in a way which delivers certainty and continuity for people and businesses across the UK."""

His body was found close to The Street, near a pig and poultry farm by a passer-by who contacted the police at around 10.45am. The family of retired BT worker Mr Wrighton, who had been married for 59 years, paid tribute to his ""kind nature"" and his ""love of walking his dogs and chatting with people to pass the time of day"". They said: ""Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him. The victim had driven to the wooded area near the Fiveways Junction - close to the village of East Harling - in his Red Skoda Fabia. He is understood to have regularly walked his dogs in the area - which is popular with dog walkers and families - at around the same time every day. Officers are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the man in his car or walking with his dogs between 9am and 11am. Residents have also been asked to check their bins and garden waste for bloody clothing or a knife. Chief Superintendent Mike Fawcett said he understands the shock of residents ""that a murder with this level of brutality can happen to an elderly man going about his daily business in our county"". He asked for people to report any ""people or a vehicle that looks out of place"", and appealed for businesses near the area to save and hand in any CCTV footage from Saturday 5 August.

2017-08-09,A Jurassic crocodile that terrorised coastal waters around the UK has been named after the late Motorhead frontman Lemmy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/jurassic-crocodile-named-after-late-motorhead-frontman-lemmy-10980628,"Like the hell-raising rocker it is named after, the creature was no shrinking violet. At 19ft (5.8m) long, with a skull measuring just over a metre, it used its large, blunt teeth to crush bones and turtle shells. It would have been one of the biggest coastal predators of its time when it roamed the Earth more than 145 million years ago. It has now been named Lemmysuchus, which translates as ""Lemmy's crocodile"". It comes after a study of a fossil skeleton housed at London's Natural History Museum, which was dug up from a clay pit near Peterborough in 1909, by University of Edinburgh palaeontologist Michela Johnson. Ms Johnson realised it had been incorrectly classified and required a new scientific name, with the Lemmy inspiration coming from the Natural History Museum's Lorna Steel. ""Although Lemmy passed away at the end of 2015, we'd like to think that he would have raised a glass to Lemmysuchus, one of the nastiest sea creatures to have ever inhabited the Earth,"" Dr Steel said. ""As a long-standing Motorhead fan I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to immortalise the rock star in this way."" Lemmysuchus was part of an extinct group of reptiles known as teleosaurs, which were distantly related to the crocodiles of today. ""It can be difficult to identify new species as we are normally working with incomplete fossil skeletons,"" Ms Johnson, a PhD student, said. ""Following careful anatomical comparison, and by referring to the main specimen held at the Natural History Museum, we could see that most of the previous finds were actually from relatives of Lemmysuchus rather than the species itself, and we were able to assign a new name."""

The Centre for Crime Prevention and animal charities such as the RSPCA and Battersea Dogs & Cats Home want it increased to five years, in line with Northern Ireland and other countries. A new report by the Centre for Crime Prevention reveals that 12 in every 13 people convicted or cautioned for cruelty to animals since 2005 have avoided prison. The number of suspended prison sentences, which means no actual time in jail, rose from 14% in 2005 to 66% last year. Many found guilty are given suspended sentences, community service or fines. The report also finds average fines for animal cruelty fell from £479 in 2005 to £296 in 2016. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, told Sky News a review of sentencing is now needed. He said: ""It's been 10 years since the last time animal cruelty was looked at. ""It's now the right time to look at whether we have kept up with other countries, why is it Britain is so far behind? ""Northern Ireland has five years as the maximum sentence. That is about right. ""It maybe should be higher but it certainly shouldn't be six months."" Among those cases that resulted in a fine or suspended sentence were the starving of a dog to death; the filming of a bulldog being thrown down the stairs so many times it had to be put down; and the strangling of a cat before it was thrown in the bin. Caroline Allen, veterinary director at the RSPCA's Harmsworth Animal Hospital in north London, said some of the cases she sees are horrific. ""We've seen a dog that's been attacked by someone using a machete,"" she explained. ""We had a pregnant Staffordshire bull terrier that was stabbed in the abdomen, fortunately the puppies were saved. ""Collars that have grown in and caused horrendous wounds, cats thrown out of windows resulting in broken legs."" David Bowles, head of public affairs at the RSPCA, called on the Government to bring laws on animal cruelty into line with other countries. He said: ""We see lots of horrific things during our day-to-day work and it gets frustrating when that goes to court and the judge says he'd like to give a stronger sentence but 'I can't because I'm limited by the laws'."" Laws surrounding animal rights legislation are overseen by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, which said it is reviewing the issue of increasing penalties in the most severe cases."
2017-08-09,The number of potential extremists flagged up by members of the public to the Government's counter-terrorism scheme has doubled since a spate of deadly attacks hit the country.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/referrals-to-anti-terror-prevent-scheme-double-after-attacks-10981168,"Police said they had received around 200 referrals to the Prevent programme from April to the end of July - around twice the number of referrals recorded in the previous four months. The figures were released by Simon Cole, the National Police Chief Council's lead spokesman on de-radicalisation efforts. ""Even though these referrals from the public are increasing, we still need more people to have the confidence to tell our safeguarding experts if they are worried about someone's behaviour,"" Mr Cole said. Prevent is a voluntary programme aiming to intervene early to stop people being drawn into violent extremism. The scheme has been credited with helping disrupting more than 150 attempted trips to conflicts in Iraq and Syria. About 55 to 60% of referrals were related to possible involvement by British individuals with Islamic State militants, Mr Cole said. But the programme is highly controversial because many Muslims believe it has been used as a tool to spy on their communities rather than simply sway potential militants from becoming radicalised. Critics have called it ""toxic"", urging the Government to scrap it or at least review it. Mr Cole said the number of referrals made to Prevent by members of the public was still relatively low, with 500 made in 2016 and 2017 compared to an annual total of about 6,300. The other referrals were made by Government or police bodies or other public organizations. About 15% of the referrals were related to right-wing extremism. Officials said the number of referrals about suspected right-wing extremists had doubled since the murder in June 2016 of Jo Cox, the MP who was killed by a loner obsessed with Nazis and white supremacist ideology. Mr Cole urged everyone involved in the scheme to ""challenge damaging myths and be more transparent in our approach"". ""We would rather people show concern before something happens,"" he said. Referrals are assessed by a number of agencies and not all are ultimately deemed to require intervention. Britain is on its second highest threat level - ""severe"", meaning another attack is highly likely. In the past few months it has been hit by four deadly attacks. In March, a man killed five people after driving into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London before stabbing a policeman to death outside the Houses of Parliament. That was followed by a suicide bombing at an Arian Grande pop concert in Manchester which left 22 dead, many of them young. In April eight people died after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people at nearby restaurants and bars. Two weeks later a van was driven into worshippers near a London mosque which left one man dead."

Senior Government sources have told Sky News that a number of position papers have been sent to Cabinet ministers for sign off as No 10 prepares to publish the documents outlining its stance on some of the most pressing Brexit matters. Government sources say some of those papers could be published in the next two weeks. ""These papers are meant to facilitate collective decision-making based on facts and evidence,"" said a senior source. Position papers have been prepared on a range of issues from digital economy and data protection, to Northern Ireland, customs agreement and goods and services arrangements once Britain quits the European Union. No 10 hopes the position papers will unify a fractious Cabinet on an agreed position; counter the perception that the British Government is unprepared for Brexit; and ease the burden of workload on the civil service. ""I know there is a desire to narrow the set of options and that is coming from departments rather than DExEU. It is a lot of work to keep open five or six scenarios, so there is a desire to make some decisions now, regardless of negotiations,"" said one senior Government source. A Government source told Sky News ministers and officials have been working flat out to draw up the position papers, aware that the Brexit deadline is fast approaching. ""Position papers may determine whether or not we can move to the second stage of negotiations, work in recess is vital,"" said the figure. ""We never sleep."" The Government is planning a ministerial write round - where relevant ministers beyond the Cabinet are given sight of the position papers - for the week beginning 21 August, suggesting papers could be published from that week onwards. Britain and the EU cannot move onto talks about Britain's future relationship with the EU, the second stage of negotiations, until the European Commission is satisfied ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the top three priorities: citizens' rights, Britain's Brexit bill and the Irish border. The border issue is proving difficult. The Irish government has rejected a proposal from the British to use technology - cameras, pre-registered cargo - to avoid a hard border, and is instead pushing for the UK to join a new bilateral customs union with the EU. Mrs May's renewed focus on Britain's Brexit position comes after a chaotic few weeks, with her cabinet split over a possible transition period after the UK quits the European Union and what a post-Brexit immigration policy might look like. Chancellor Philip Hammond said in recent weeks there is now ""broad acceptance"" among the cabinet that a transitional period will be needed after Britain quits the EU and said ""many things will look similar"" for up to three years after leaving. That position is expected to be formalised in the position paper, with the government seeking a transitional customs arrangement to avoid a hard cliff edge for business."

She apologised for the oversight. The Treasury Select Committee concluded at the time that her ""professional competence"" fell short of the required standard. Ms Hogg, whose brother Quintin worked in a senior strategy role at Barclays, is the daughter of Douglas Hogg, the third Viscount Hailsham and a former cabinet minister. A new report, which was commissioned by the Bank after her resignation in March, has found that established HR processes were not followed when she joined. Instead, conflict of interest declarations were made via a ""brief exchange of emails"" with the chairman of the Court - the board that oversees the Bank of England. When she applied to become deputy governor there was no requirement for the Bank's detailed conflict of interest policies to be considered during the process, the review also found. Ms Hogg did mention the matter of her brother's role at Barclays in a questionnaire for MPs on the Treasury Select Committee over the appointment. But no check was carried out by the Bank to ensure that the information she had given to the committee ""was consistent with that recorded on the Bank's systems"", the report said. It added: ""More generally, there was insufficient focus on the risk that her brother's role could be perceived as a possible conflict."" The report by the Bank's non-executive directors was carried out with advice from an external law firm. It said: ""The events that led up to Ms Hogg's resignation highlight some shortcomings with the Bank's approach to identifying and managing possible conflicts of interest."" The review also found that while the Bank had a ""strong culture of integrity"", there was ""an insufficient practical understanding in some areas about how to identify and manage perceived conflicts of interest"". The Bank of England said a series of recommendations made by the review would all be implemented. They include the appointment of a full-time conflicts officer ""with overall executive responsibility for conflict identification and management"".

Since it became an American territory in 1898, Guam has been considered a vital asset by Washington. It lies in the Pacific east of the Philippines and around 1,700 miles south of North Korea. Its proximity to China, Japan and the Korean Peninsula hand the US a launching pad into Asia and as such it has been built up into a military fortress. :: North Korea 'examining' plan to strike Guam The US runs a naval base and Coast Guard station in the south of the island, as well as an air force base in the north which was regularly used during the Vietnam War. Based at the stations are around 6,000 US troops, with the military second only to tourism in terms of net contribution to Guam's economy. The bases cover 30% of the entire island, which is roughly the size of Chicago and has a population of 162,000. While it gives the US the capability to launch strikes in Asia, Guam also serves an important defensive function for Washington and its allies. In 2013, the US Army's Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system was deployed to the island - giving Washington the power to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles. :: Trump's fighting talk on N Korea may prove wise This makes it a target for Pyongyang, as does its remoteness. Residents on the island described their fears after getting caught in the middle of a war of words between Washington and Pyongyang. Cecil Chugrad, a 37-year-old bus driver, said: ""I'm a little worried, a little panicked. Is this really going to happen? ""If it's just me, I don't mind, but I have to worry about my son. I feel like moving (out of Guam) now."" Lawyer Todd Thompson said he laughed off Pyongyang's past threats but was worried with Donald Trump's handling of tensions. ""I'm not laughing now,"" he said. ""My concern is that things have changed in Washington, and who knows what's going to happen?"" His brother Mitch added he believes many on the island ""have no confidence that the White House will do the right thing under the circumstances"". Reacting to North Korea's threat of a military strike, Guam governor Eddie Calvo reminded Americans in mainland USA that the island is ""not just a military installation"". He said: ""I have reached out to the White House this morning. ""An attack or threat to Guam is a threat or attack on the United States. They have said that America will be defended."""
2017-08-09,A police operation targeting sex abusers in the North East has so far identified 278 victims and hundreds more complainants.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/teenage-girls-systematically-groomed-and-abused-by-gang-in-newcastle-and-gateshead-10981377,"Operation Sanctuary exposed the rape and abuse of underage girls in a sex ring which operated in deprived areas of Newcastle and Gateshead. Four trials at Newcastle Crown Court heard how vulnerable girls were groomed by men who gave them alcohol and drugs before raping them at parties known as ""sessions"". In what is the largest sex abuse investigation the Northumbria force has ever undertaken, 461 arrests were made after 703 potential complainants came forward. Members of the gang have been imprisoned for a combined time of more than 300 years. At the final trial, 17 men and one women were convicted of, or admitted to, charges including rape, supplying drugs and inciting prostitution. Twenty young women told the court about the systematic abuse they had been subjected to over a number of years. They told how teenagers were plied with cocaine, cannabis, alcohol and the designer drug M-CAT(mephedrone) by the gang. They were then raped or persuaded into having sex with the lure of the drugs. Despite the convictions, there has been criticism of the Northumbria Police for paying a convicted child rapist almost £10,000 to spy on the parties. The trial heard that the informant had a previous conviction for drugging and raping an underage girl and inviting another man to do the same. ""The means can never justify the ends in a situation like this where you are putting a convicted child rapist in contact with very vulnerable children,"" said NSPCC spokesman Jon Brown said. ""It absolutely beggars belief and were are staggered at the NSPCC to understand that this has happened."" :: Snouts and narks: The murky world of police informants However, Chief Constable Steve Ashman suggested that the means justified the ends. ""I can categorically state that there are vulnerable women and girls today who have been safeguarded, and dangerous men behind bars, by using this tactic,"" he said. Jim Hope, Head of Complex Casework for the Crown Prosecution Service, paid tribute to the ""courageous"" victims. ""Many of those convicted during the course of these trails have systematically been groomed and abused: vulnerable teenage girls and young women over a number of years for their own (the gang's) sexual gratification. ""Despite the abuses they have suffered, the victims have demonstrated great bravery in recounting their own distressing experiences in court. ""Through their courageous actions they may well have prevented other vulnerable women and girls from falling victim to this group."" The Newcastle case is the biggest child sex investigation since the scandals in Rotherham and Rochdale. A report into the abuse in Rotherham, which came to light in November 2010, found that at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited between 1997 and 2013. It branded the local council ""not fit for purpose"". Then, in 2012, there was widespread public outrage after nine Asian men were jailed after grooming five girls - aged between 13 and 15 - in and around Rochdale between 2008 and 2010. Arrests or prosecutions of groups of men for similar abuse also took place in 11 towns and cities, including Oxford, Bristol and Aylesbury."
2017-08-09,"When I first heard Donald Trump’s ""fire and fury"" quote, I assumed it was from Pyongyang.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/ramping-up-rhetoric-risks-miscalculation-between-us-and-north-korea-10980606,"This is the kind of rhetoric we usually hear on North Korean state television. Kim Jong Un's newscasters semi-regularly threaten to reduce Seoul and/or Washington to a ""sea of flames"". Perhaps President Trump thinks he's talking in language the North Korean leader understands. Believing, as he appears to, that he is one of the world's greatest dealmakers, maybe this is all part of his strategy to bring the young ruler into line - ratchet up sanctions, threaten to rain down fire and fury, and wait for the other side to blink, for a cowed regime to beg for talks and agree to renounce its nuclear ambitions. Except they won't. Here is why this kind of shouting match is dangerous. The Kim regime's survival, and its guiding ideology, is based on the premise that the country faces the constant threat of invasion and annihilation at the hands of evil American imperialists, which only its wise leadership can defend them from. From nursery school upwards, children are taught that their nation stands, almost alone now, in defence of the global cause of socialism against the covetous foreign capitalists at the gate. They are not told that their leader started the Korean War, they are told that they were attacked, and nearly destroyed, by the United States and their ""puppet war maniacs"" in Seoul, and that it could happen again at any time. :: North Korea 'examining' plan to strike Guam :: Why is North Korea threatening Guam? This is why they are told they need nuclear weapons - a powerful deterrent that will ensure their nation's survival. When the US President has himself been filmed threatening ""fire and fury"" he merely underlines the point - and reinforces why any sacrifices sanctions may bring are necessary. The other problem with fiery ultimatums is what happens when you don't follow through on them. At the start of the year, then President-elect Trump dismissed North Korea's declared aim to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ""It won't happen,"" he tweeted. Well, it has happened. They test-fired two last month alone. :: Stock markets slip as North Korea tensions build Within a couple of hours of Donald Trump's warning not to make any more threats, on penalty of ""fire and fury"", North Korea had already announced yet another detailed threat - that they were carefully examining plans to strike the US territory of Guam. Taking issue with the President's approach, Senator John McCain said: ""You've got to be sure you can do what you say you're going to do."" Donald Trump must be well briefed that even the most targeted US military strike on North Korea risks spiralling into conflict on a scale not seen since the Second World War, just as Kim Jong Un must know that attacking Guam would be suicide. But ramping up the rhetoric does nothing to calm nerves between two nuclear-armed states and risks miscalculation on both sides. As Senator McCain concluded: ""This is very, very, very serious."""

A spokesman for the Korean People's Army said the strike plan would be ""put into practice in a multi-current and consecutive way any moment"" once Kim Jong Un makes a decision. He added that ""enveloping fire"" would be used to contain major US military bases on the island territory in the western Pacific Ocean - including the Anderson Air Force Base. KCNA, Pyongyang's state-run news agency, also carried a statement from a different military official which said North Korea may carry out a pre-emptive operation if the US shows signs of provocation. :: Why is North Korea threatening to strike Guam? :: Trump's fighting talk on North Korea may prove wise Guam's governor, Eddie Calvo, has said there is no change in the territory's threat level, and has reassured locals that several layers of defence are strategically placed to protect it. He added that Guam is ""not just a military installation"", but American soil with American citizens. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said President Trump delivered his message in the way that he did because the North Korean leader ""doesn't seem to understand diplomatic language"". Speaking on his way to Guam, Mr Tillerson said Mr Trump wanted to ""avoid any miscalculation"" by Pyongyang and make clear the US has the ""unquestionable ability to defend itself"". As Mr Tillerson downplayed Mr Trump's remarks, the President flexed his muscles further by boasting the US' nuclear arsenal was ""more powerful than ever"". He added: ""Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!"" My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.... ...Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world! :: Stock markets slip as North Korea tensions rise Earlier on Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that North Korea has successfully made a miniaturised nuclear warhead that can fit inside one of its intercontinental ballistic missiles. The newspaper said that claim was contained in a confidential assessment by America's Defence Intelligence Agency. An analyst who specialises in North Korea, who asked not to be named, told Sky News he believes Pyongyang is ""a lot more than halfway"" to achieving its aims of producing a nuclear weapon capable of exploding above the US mainland. He added: ""It's fair to say it's just a matter of time, in terms of being able to hit the hit the US with a (nuclear) missile."" On Monday, North Korea responded angrily after the UN imposed tough new sanctions on the isolated state following the test-firing of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Pyongyang said the sanctions were caused by a ""heinous US plot to isolate and stifle"" the country - and its officials also threatened to make America ""pay the price for its crime... thousands of times""."
2017-08-09,"More than a decade into social media, we like to think we're pretty savvy by this point.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/how-much-dirt-do-social-networks-have-on-you-10977974,"Sure, we give up some of our personal data, but we're wise to the deal - we get addictive, free apps and services in return. And what's a few silly photos? We can always remove them, or make them vanish, thanks to privacy controls. :: Google and Facebook could be fined billions under new law So the Government's Data Protection Bill, under which anyone can ask for personal information to be deleted, a ""right to be forgotten"", might seem like something nice, but niche. I wonder if we realise how much dirt the social networks actually have on us. It's not just photos and status updates - the information we consciously hand over. If you're a WhatsApp user, it knows your phone and, a lot of the time, it knows your location. It knows what news stories you like, which adverts you've clicked on. It knows which of your Facebook friends - or Instagram followers - you fancy. Facebook is ubiquitous around the internet so its shares buttons appear on news sites, or are used for ID. It follows you around the internet, tracking your every click. It then combines that information it gathers with third party sources like Experian, which builds up consumer profiles based on credit card spending and other sources. As John Lanchester writes in the London Review of Books: ""What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business."" But the same goes for all the tech giants - they're very, very thirsty for your personal information. So the right to be forgotten is something quite profound. First, you have the right to know what Facebook knows about you, not just what you've uploaded, but the conclusions that the company has drawn, then sold on to advertisers trying to sway you. Then you'll have the right for that information to be removed. That could represent a shift in our relation to the digital platforms that control much of the modern world. It will rely on people taking it up of course. You can already ask any company for the data it holds about you, for a £10 fee, under something called a Subject Access Request. Few do. (Even though you can find out how attractive, say, Tinder thinks you are.) The impulse here isn't a Luddite one. Data is becoming the fuel of the AI-based economy, the coal to the steam engines of a new industrial revolution. By giving consumers control of their data, it means businesses can be more confident in how they use it. Rather than pushing the boundaries of people's privacy, they know the data they do process is there by consent - and safe to use. That feeds into another part of the bill: making sure data can flow freely. This is crucial to the economy and something that might have been threatened by Brexit. That also illustrates another point. The Data Protection Bill is pretty much identical to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has to be, to ensure the flow of data. The GDPR also contains the ""right to erasure"", the right to be forgotten. It's been in the works since 2012 and has been more or less ignored by the mainstream media and general public.When a law is promulgated from Brussels, it's boring, bureaucratic meddling. When the British Government announces the same thing, it dominates headlines and strikes a blow for freedom. We're again realising, a little late, that the wonks in Brussels might have been on to something."
2017-08-09,Scientists believe a dinosaur the length of three London buses could be the largest creature to have ever walked the Earth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/largest-dinosaur-to-walk-earth-was-length-of-three-london-buses-10980531,"A study of the fossilised remains of six young adult dinosaurs found in Argentina estimates the Patagotitan mayorum had a body mass of a staggering 61 tons, was 35m (115ft) long and was nearly 6m (20ft) high at the shoulder. It means the giant creature was longer than three of the capital's new Routemaster buses, weighed more than some Boeing 737 aircraft, and was as tall as a male giraffe at its shoulder. Classed as part of a group of large dinosaurs called titanosaurs, the Patagotitan mayorum is believed to have lived 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. As a sauropod, it would been a plant-eater that stood on four legs with a long tail and neck. The fossils, including vertebrae and rib bones, were found at a quarry in Chubut Province in Argentina's Patagonia region in 2013. The discovery of six different individuals together, believed to have died in a floodplain region before being preserved in mud, is the first indication that titanosaurs engaged in social activity. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, researchers led by Dr Jose Carballido, from the Museo Paleontologico Egidio Feruglio in Argentina, have now described the Patagotitan mayorum as ""the largest known dinosaur species"". Although the Argentinosaurus has previously been handed the title of biggest land animal ever, estimates of its body mass of 79 tons were not based on limb measurements and may be unreliable. The researchers said vertebrae from Argentinosaurus suggest it was 10% smaller than Patagotitan mayorum. It is believed the Patagotitan mayorum was able to get so massive due to an explosion of flowering plants at the time it lived. Study co-author Diego Pol said: ""I don't think they were scary at all. They were probably massive slow-moving animals. ""Getting up. Walking around. Trying to run. It's really challenging for large animals."" He suggested carnivorous Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaurs would ""look like dwarfs when you put them against one of these giant titanosaurs"", adding: ""It's like when you put an elephant by a lion."" University of Maryland palaeontologist Thomas Holtz, who was not part of the study, said: ""It's hard to argue this isn't a big deal when it concerns the (probable) largest land animal ever discovered."" Other researchers suggested the fact the fossils were of not fully mature adults points to there being even bigger dinosaur bones left to discover."
2017-08-09,UK-based payments processing firm Worldpay has formally agreed to a £9.3bn takeover by US rival Vantiv.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810020234/http://news.sky.com/story/worldpay-formally-agrees-93bn-takeover-by-us-rival-10980645,"The deal creates a global giant with a combined value of £22.2bn, 57% owned by Vantiv shareholders and 43% by those currently holding Worldpay stock. It will see Vantiv pay £8bn for the company plus £1.3bn to cover debts. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and is expected to complete early next year. Worldpay, set up in 1989, was part of Royal Bank of Scotland before being spun out to private equity ownership under EU state aid rules after the bank's £45bn bail-out following the financial crisis. It was floated on the London stock market in 2015 with an initial valuation of £4.8bn and the new company formed out of the takeover - which will keep the Worldpay name - will retain a secondary listing in the capital, though its main listing will be in New York. The formal announcement of the takeover disclosed that Vantiv had been eyeing a deal since even before that flotation and that the two companies held abortive talks early last year, before reviving discussions this summer. An initial agreement was reached in July but the companies spent several weeks ironing out further details. The new group's global and corporate headquarters will be in Cincinatti, Ohio, though it will have its international HQ in London and the combined company will be named Worldpay. It will be led by Vantiv's Charles Drucker as executive chairman and co-chief executive, with Worldpay's current boss Philip Jansen as co-chief executive. The formal announcement confirmed an exclusive Sky News report that Worldpay's chairman Sir Mike Rake will be lead director of the business's board. The combined group will process around $1.5tn (£1.2tn) of payments and 40 billion transactions through more than 300 payment methods in 146 countries and 126 currencies. Worldpay currently processes more than 40 million payments a day in stores, online and on mobile phones. Mr Jansen said the merger deal would create a global leader ""with substantial opportunities to capitalise on the rapid evolution of payments"". Mr Drucker said: ""This is a powerful combination that is strategically compelling for both companies."" The two companies will look to cut around $200m (£150m) a year from costs after the merger. They said these would mainly be through the consolidation of operations in the US while just over a third were expected to come through savings in corporate, e-commerce and tech operations. Vantiv said it had ""high regard for the skills and experience"" of Worldpay's management and 5,000-strong workforce and that their existing employment and pension rights would be observed. The announcement came as Worldpay reported a 24% fall in pre-tax profits to £129m for the six months to the end of June, despite a strong underlying performance, as it continued to make accounting adjustments following its split from RBS."

But the Bank said the alternative of using palm oil raised environmental concerns and would cost the Treasury an extra £16.5m over the next ten years. The Government told the Bank it did not believe a switch would be achieve value for money for taxpayers. Campaigners launched a petition last autumn after it emerged that the new plastic £5 note contained traces of an animal product derivative. The Bank launched a review following the outcry and earlier this year decided not to scrap the notes, though it said it would hold a public consultation into the production of future notes. It has now said that after ""careful and serious consideration... there will be no change to the composition of polymer used for future banknotes"". ""The new polymer £20 note and future print runs of £5 and £10 notes will continue to be made from polymer manufactured using trace amounts of chemicals, typically less than 0.05%, ultimately derived from animal products,"" the Bank said. Its consultation involved outreach meetings with affected groups, technical trials, commercial discussions and commissioning independent environmental research. There were also responses by 3,544 people. Of these, 88% were against using animal products and only 48% against using those made from palm oil. But the Bank said it had to balance this ""against its other public duties and priorities"" and other evidence it had gathered. ""The use of palm oil raises questions about environmental sustainability and the Bank's suppliers have been unable to commit to sourcing the highest level of sustainable palm oil at this time,"" it added. ""The Bank fully recognises the concerns raised by members of the public, both prior to and during the consultation, and has not taken this decision lightly."""

The investigation has been passed from the serious collision unit to the major investigations team, based at Harlow. The incident closed the northbound carriageway, as well as the Goose Lane bridge and Goose Lane, but all routes reopened in the early hours of Thursday.

He told the Press Association: ""They were just chatting friendlily having, I think, a beer or a glass of wine and some German bread."" Prof Hardy said he was ""sure they must have arranged to be there together"" and did not seem to be with anyone else.

It has been described by Classic FM as the ""peak of operatic indulgence, excess and excellence"". Mr Gove was a key figure in former prime minister David Cameron's top team, but his decision to back Brexit soured the pair's friendship. He was sent to the backbenches when Prime Minister Theresa May came to power in July 2016, but returned as Environment Secretary after the recent General Election. Mr Osborne, who many saw as positioning himself to succeed Mr Cameron had Remain triumphed in the referendum, was also sacked by Mrs May.

A machete-wielding gang stormed the building in Tana River county - killing a man who was working for the ruling Jubilee party and injuring another. Police then shot dead two attackers. One demonstrator was killed by police following clashes in opposition strongholds across Nairobi, and officers fired tear gas to scatter a group of 100 protesters in Kisumu. Witnesses claim that the police have shot dead at least three people, with protesters killing a fourth. Violence has escalated following claims of vote rigging by opposition leader Raila Odinga. He says provisional results putting his rival Uhuru Kenyatta firmly in the lead are ""fictitious"". Mr Odinga has claimed hackers could have used the identity of murdered election official Chris Msando to ""create errors"" in the country's electoral database. President Kenyatta, the 55-year-old incumbent, is a wealthy businessman and the son of Kenya's first president. Opposition leader Mr Odinga is a left-wing former political prisoner who unsuccessfully used the courts to contest his defeat in the last presidential election in 2013. Mr Kenyatta, who is seeking a second five-year term, has held a steady lead of about 10% since the start of counting after Tuesday's peaceful vote. Officials from Kenya's election commission have dismissed claims of irregularities - and insist the vote was free and fair. There have been widespread fears that the violence which followed the disputed 2007 election - killing 1,200 people - could be repeated. Reporting from Nairobi, Sky's Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley said: ""This is the sort of election violence that was predicted and feared. ""Now the scale of it - whether it spreads across the country - will depend on the scale of the electoral fraud."" The Kenya Human Rights Commission, a non-governmental organisation, said it had discovered some discrepancies between provisional results on the election commission website and the paper forms.

The franchise covers routes across the West Midlands - as well as trains from London Euston to Crewe and Liverpool to Birmingham. The Department for Transport said the decision would mean £1bn invested in services and that passengers would see new, longer trains, free Wi-Fi on all mainline services and compensation if services are delayed by more than 15 minutes. Since 2007, the London Midland franchise has been run by Govia, which is a joint venture between Go-Ahead and French firm Keolis. Govia will continue to run the network until December. The new deal will run until 2026. Go-Ahead chief executive David Brown said in that period it had ""delivered significant improvements across the entire network"".

It recommended that funding for schools to take students to the theatre should be increased and called on HMRC to enforce the living wage across the arts. MPs Tracy Brabin and Gloria De Piero, who put together the report, said ""we'll all be poorer"" if progress is not made and argued that performing arts were a ""mirror to the nation"". ""As women from northern working class backgrounds who went on to work in TV, we know what it's like to have people sneer at your accent, and struggle to pay your way,"" they said.

Rakie Ayola, who plays Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child stage play, praised the recommendations of the report. ""If you ask everyone in the industry if they are for diversity they all put their hands up, but there comes a time when people need to say it out loud,"" she said. ""That time is now."" A Government spokesman said it was committed to ensuring everyone had access to arts and culture. He said there was no evidence for some the report's criticism that the EBacc performance measure, tied to GCSEs in subjects such as English, maths and science, had led to a ""systematic marginalisation of arts subjects"".

failings they believe let killers escape justice.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810174148/http://news.sky.com/story/omagh-bombing-victims-families-to-sue-ni-police-chief-10982124,"Bereaved families have issued a writ against chief constable George Hamilton, seeking damages and a declaration their human rights have been breached. The Real IRA attack in August 1998 claimed 29 lives and was the biggest single atrocity during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The writ against Mr Hamilton focuses on what happened after the bomb detonated and why no one has been successfully convicted in a criminal court. Victims' relatives have already successfully sued four republicans in a civil trial that found they were responsible for the bombing. Families are also pursuing judicial review proceedings against the Government's decision not to hold a public inquiry into claims the attack could have been prevented if it had not been for a series of intelligence failings. Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son Aiden died in the bombing, said the families needed justice. ""Here we are 19 years on and the criminals responsible for this are still walking the streets - there has been absolutely no punitive measures taken against any of them,"" he said. ""We can't walk away and say 'it's just one of those things'. Stanley McComb, whose wife Ann was killed, said the case is ""what drives me on"". He said: ""Every morning I wake I am on my own, every night I go to bed I am on my own. My partner, my wife of 25 years, is no longer there and should be there. ""Why should people get away with something like that?"" The writ cites the findings of official inquiries and court proceedings that identified multiple failures in how police investigated the bombing. These include: :: A 2001 report by Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan which found many evidential opportunities were missed and expressed concern that warnings of a likely attack passed to police by informants were not acted upon :: The acquittal of electrician Sean Hoey of the Omagh murders in 2007, during which judge Mr Justice Weir heavily criticised the way forensic evidence had been dealt with :: A 2014 report by Police Ombudsman Dr Michael Maguire which highlighted inexplicable delays in arresting known suspects in the days after the attack :: Flaws in state evidence exposed when the prosecution of bricklayer Seamus Daly for the Omagh murders was dropped before it reached trial last year."

It was the only one of the group's geographical divisions that failed to post volume growth. But TUI said the fact that the numbers were unchanged was ""testament to the popularity of our holidays and the high level of priority our customers place on them"". The update chimes with wider evidence that the squeeze on UK households and economic uncertainty over Brexit has yet to hit leisure activities such as holidays and eating out though it is hurting retailers such as those in the clothing sector. Meanwhile TUI said previously announced plans for re-branding that will see the Thomson brand disappear are to go ahead in the UK this autumn. The travel giant also said it was starting to see renewed popularity for holidays to Turkey and North Africa - destinations which have been affected by political chaos and terror attacks. TUI said: ""In the UK, as we expected, demand for our holidays remains resilient. ""Bookings have remained at the same high level as prior year, despite the impact on pricing from cost inflation, in particular due to the weaker pound sterling."" The pound plunged sharply after last year's Brexit vote - which means that, for British tourists it does not go as far when exchanged for euros or other foreign currencies in holiday destinations. It has also resulted in travel operators such as TUI putting up sterling prices to reflect the same currency change. TUI reported a 13% rise in revenue for the third quarter to the end of June to €4.8bn and a 38% increase in underlying earnings to €222m, partly helped by the timing of Easter."
2017-08-10,"We are used to farcical missile tests going comically wrong. Lorries with huge missiles on parade, that we know have never been tested.

Kim Jong Un's regime has gone nuclear - or is very nearly there. Japanese and US intelligence sources claim his scientists have mastered the technology of miniaturising nuclear warheads to fit them in a missile. And they have stunned the world with their missile capability, too, with far more successful missile tests than had been expected. Its atomic Holy Grail is within its grasp: a nuclear missile that can sail all the way from North Korea to a major American city. America, Europe, China and Russia have all failed. There will now need to be a fundamental shift in strategy. Decades of negotiations, sanctions and threats have all had one goal in mind: stopping one of the world's most erratic, dangerous and enigmatic regimes getting its hands on the bomb. Negotiators used a carrot and stick approach. Sanctions punished progress, while aid rewarded the opposite. The Kim regime mastered the art of nuclear blackmail - essential to it staying in power given its catastrophic mismanagement of the North Korean economy. Kim Jong Un watched and learned how his father played the West and he saw what happens to those who give up their weapons of mass destruction. Libya's Colonel Gaddaffi died mutilated in a ditch after an uprising supported by the West. Kim was determined to avoid the same fate. The Trump administration faces an atomic fait accompli and it is arguably more badly suited to dealing with it than any administration in history. Most observers agree that clever, careful diplomacy is now essential. But America's 'Diplomat In Chief' is no diplomat. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is a career oil man who is learning his new role on the job. His State Department is plagued by low morale, gutted by mass resignations and unfilled appointments. The President is no master strategist. He is surrounded by generals, who fill most of his most senior roles, and family members - none of them formally qualified for office let alone complicated foreign relations. His generals are all highly regarded but as military men - not diplomats. They are not practised in the art of statecraft. What is needed is urgent diplomatic action to defuse dangerous mounting tensions, then a sea change in strategic thinking to contain the North Korean threat. It would be a huge challenge for a seasoned experienced administration... the Trump presidency is anything but."
2017-08-10,"More than a decade into social media, we like to think we're pretty savvy by this point.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170810174148/http://news.sky.com/story/how-much-dirt-do-social-networks-have-on-you-10977974,"Sure, we give up some of our personal data, but we're wise to the deal - we get addictive, free apps and services in return. And what's a few silly photos? We can always remove them, or make them vanish, thanks to privacy controls. :: Google and Facebook could be fined billions under new law So the Government's Data Protection Bill, under which anyone can ask for personal information to be deleted, a ""right to be forgotten"", might seem like something nice, but niche. I wonder if we realise how much dirt the social networks actually have on us. It's not just photos and status updates - the information we consciously hand over. If you're a WhatsApp user, it knows your phone and, a lot of the time, it knows your location. It knows what news stories you like, which adverts you've clicked on. It knows which of your Facebook friends - or Instagram followers - you fancy. Facebook is ubiquitous around the internet so its shares buttons appear on news sites, or are used for ID. It follows you around the internet, tracking your every click. It then combines that information it gathers with third party sources like Experian, which builds up consumer profiles based on credit card spending and other sources. As John Lanchester writes in the London Review of Books: ""What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business."" But the same goes for all the tech giants - they're very, very thirsty for your personal information. So the right to be forgotten is something quite profound. First, you have the right to know what Facebook knows about you, not just what you've uploaded, but the conclusions that the company has drawn, then sold on to advertisers trying to sway you. Then you'll have the right for that information to be removed. That could represent a shift in our relation to the digital platforms that control much of the modern world. It will rely on people taking it up of course. You can already ask any company for the data it holds about you, for a £10 fee, under something called a Subject Access Request. Few do. (Even though you can find out how attractive, say, Tinder thinks you are.) The impulse here isn't a Luddite one. Data is becoming the fuel of the AI-based economy, the coal to the steam engines of a new industrial revolution. By giving consumers control of their data, it means businesses can be more confident in how they use it. Rather than pushing the boundaries of people's privacy, they know the data they do process is there by consent - and safe to use. That feeds into another part of the bill: making sure data can flow freely. This is crucial to the economy and something that might have been threatened by Brexit. That also illustrates another point. The Data Protection Bill is pretty much identical to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has to be, to ensure the flow of data. The GDPR also contains the ""right to erasure"", the right to be forgotten. It's been in the works since 2012 and has been more or less ignored by the mainstream media and general public.When a law is promulgated from Brussels, it's boring, bureaucratic meddling. When the British Government announces the same thing, it dominates headlines and strikes a blow for freedom. We're again realising, a little late, that the wonks in Brussels might have been on to something."

Following the conclusion of four linked trials, 17 men and one woman were convicted or admitted offences that range from rape to inciting prostitution and supplying drugs. While Northumbria Police chief constable Steve Ashman said he would ""not rule out"" using a convicted rapist to aid an investigation again, the NSPCC has described the informant's role in the case as ""staggering"". :: Snouts and narks: The murky world of police informants NSPCC spokesman Jon Brown said: ""It beggars belief that they thought it was okay to put an individual who clearly still represented a risk in contact with vulnerable children. ""We are of the view that this needs to be thoroughly understood and reviewed to get an idea of what on Earth they were thinking of. ""I'm not aware of another circumstance in the country where something similar has happened."" Mr Brown said Northumbria Police should have placed greater importance on the vulnerability of the girls the informant came into contact with. He said: ""The thought process… beggars belief, we just don't understand it. Questions need to be answered."" The informant, who can only be identified as XY, was recruited years after he drugged an underage girl and invited another man to rape her after he had done so. During pre-trial hearings, a jury was told XY was arrested after his recruitment following a teenage girl's claim she had been approached by a man who made an indecent proposition. The informant was later told he would face no action after he took part in an identity parade. During legal submissions, XY gave evidence to the court and made a series of allegations against the police, including claims of racism and that he was asked to plant drugs. He claimed he was recruited because he acted as an informal taxi driver for some of the defendants and ""had to make it look like I was their friend"". A judge rejected his evidence in its entirety, describing it as ""inherently unreliable"" and ""clearly dishonest"".

Several products, including salads, sold at Sainbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda have been withdrawn. :: List of the products being withdrawn The FSA said investigations indicated it was ""very unlikely"" that the eggs posed a risk to public health. Some of the products containing the eggs had a short shelf life and will have already been consumed, the FSA said. However, other foods were still within the expiry date and are now being withdrawn from sale. The eggs come from farms implicated in the use of the insecticide Fipronil, used in veterinary products to treat ticks and fleas. The World Health Organisation considers the insecticide to be ""moderately hazardous"" and says it can have dangerous effects on the the liver, kidneys and thyroid glands. The news comes as investigators carried out coordinated raids linked to the Fipronil probe in Belgium and the Netherlands. Dutch authorities on Thursday arrested two men as part of their investigation into the tainted eggs. A day earlier Belgium accused the Netherlands of knowing about the potential problems and failing to sound the alarm. But Belgian officials have also admitted they were notified of a problem and failed to trigger the EU's international food safety alert system. A Dutch farming organisation has said that several million hens may need to be culled across 150 companies in the country, and that 300,000 have already been killed. In Germany and Holland supermarkets Aldi and Lidl have already taken millions of eggs off their shelves, in what Aldi said was a ""purely precautionary"" measure. Britain produces 85% of the eggs it consumes, but imports approximately two billion each year. The British Egg Industry Council said consumers concerned about the safety of their food should look for British Lion eggs. ""Shell eggs on sale to consumers are not affected and the FSA says that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs,"" it said. ""All major UK retailers stock British Lion shell eggs and tests have shown that there is no risk from British eggs."""

Since it became an American territory in 1898, Guam has been considered a vital asset by Washington. It lies in the Pacific east of the Philippines and around 1,700 miles south of North Korea. Its proximity to China, Japan and the Korean Peninsula hand the US a launching pad into Asia and as such it has been built up into a military fortress. :: North Korea 'examining' plan to strike Guam The US runs a naval base and Coast Guard station in the south of the island, as well as an air force base in the north which was regularly used during the Vietnam War. Based at the stations are around 6,000 US troops, with the military second only to tourism in terms of net contribution to Guam's economy. The bases cover 30% of the entire island, which is roughly the size of Chicago and has a population of 162,000. While it gives the US the capability to launch strikes in Asia, Guam also serves an important defensive function for Washington and its allies. In 2013, the US Army's Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system was deployed to the island - giving Washington the power to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles. :: Trump's fighting talk on N Korea may prove wise This makes it a target for Pyongyang, as does its remoteness. Residents on the island described their fears after getting caught in the middle of a war of words between Washington and Pyongyang. Cecil Chugrad, a 37-year-old bus driver, said: ""I'm a little worried, a little panicked. Is this really going to happen? ""If it's just me, I don't mind, but I have to worry about my son. I feel like moving (out of Guam) now."" Lawyer Todd Thompson said he laughed off Pyongyang's past threats but was worried with Donald Trump's handling of tensions. ""I'm not laughing now,"" he said. ""My concern is that things have changed in Washington, and who knows what's going to happen?"" His brother Mitch added he believes many on the island ""have no confidence that the White House will do the right thing under the circumstances"". Reacting to North Korea's threat of a military strike, Guam governor Eddie Calvo reminded Americans in mainland USA that the island is ""not just a military installation"". He said: ""I have reached out to the White House this morning. ""An attack or threat to Guam is a threat or attack on the United States. They have said that America will be defended."""

Mr Forbes' remarks come after shadow women and equalities secretary Sarah Champion said there is a need to acknowledge that the majority of perpetrators in grooming scandals ""have been British-Pakistani"".

People give police information for a variety of reasons - for money, to remove a rival, or to get a cut in their own sentence. If an informant helps the conviction of others, police can give the judge a ""text"" - a letter - outlining the cooperation in expectation of a reduced sentence for their snout. It's become big business for the police, though it's a subject they are reluctant to discuss in detail. A recent Freedom of Information request revealed that UK forces spent £20m in five years on payments to informants. Most informants have some criminal past and one drugs squad detective I knew viewed anyone he arrested as a potential snout. Former Flying Squad detective Peter Kirkham told me: ""In broad terms you set a thief to catch a thief, but it's usually more complicated than that. If you want to know about criminality you need to get information from someone involved in that criminality."" When Mr Kirkham began his detective career 30 years ago there were few checks on how officers used informants. A detective kept the source secret and recorded no details of their meetings or payments. It was an unregulated system that was open to abuse, from both sides. The Scotland Yard investigation into the notorious 1987 axe murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan was condemned years later when it was revealed that a detective had ""coached"" his informant. In the 1990s the Yard was found to be using Jamaican Yardie gangsters as informants without realising they were carrying on their life of crime at the same time. The Yardie case led to stringent oversight of the informant system, with new rules and a code of practice. The latest Home Office guidelines set out strict procedures to be followed, especially on the use of juvenile informants. Yes, police are allowed to use children as their narks, with certain caveats. The Home Office guidelines say: ""On no occasion should the use or conduct of a CHIS under 16 years of age be authorised to give information against their parents or any person who has parental responsibility for them."" Is there a line to be to be drawn anywhere over the use of informants? Can anyone, whatever their past, be hired by police to help them convict other criminals? :: Child rapist paid £10k to spy on underage 'sex parties' An informant in the Newcastle child sex case, a convicted child rapist, claimed during a pre-trial hearing that Northumbria Police had paid him £10,000 for information about the sexual exploitation of young girls. He said part of his work included going to parties where police suspected girls would be intoxicated and sexually abused. Peter Kirkham said: ""I can't see any circumstances where somebody with his previous convictions would be approved as a participating informant to go to places where that sort of thing was happening. ""If the police had reasonable grounds to suspect what was going on they could not have allowed that to happen. ""It's not like me letting a villain steal a car for an armed robbery. In a case like that I would let the theft go ahead because it would lead me to a robbery where I could intervene and arrest more serious villains."" The Newcastle case is the biggest child sex investigation since the Rotherham and Rochdale grooming scandals and involved the trial of 25 suspects. Former North West chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who led the Rochdale prosecution in 2012, said: ""Putting a child sex offender in contact with children and other sex offenders is a line I would not cross. ""It is an ethical issue, but there is also the question of the danger to the children from someone who has already been convicted. My experience shows such men continue to offend. ""You need to be very wary. I can't think of anything that could be done to manage the very obvious risks."""

The case is unrelated to the WannaCry attack that struck the NHS in May, for which Mr Hutchins gained worldwide attention after he detected a ""kill switch"" that effectively disabled the virus. Karen Todner, the lawyer who helped fellow alleged hacker Gary McKinnon beat extradition to the US, advised Mr Hutchins to do a deal with American officials - whether or not he's guilty. She told Sky News: ""My view would be to get him back here as quickly as possible, and if that involves taking a plea agreement, he should take it."" The lawyer was speaking at a meeting of hackers and technologists in east London, who are planning how to support Mr Hutchins. Ms Todner added: ""Marcus was the hero that saved (us from) the WannaCry virus that affected the NHS a few months ago - he literally did save the NHS. ""If people feel passionately about the work he did, what they can do is write letters of support."" Lauri Love, a security researcher who is currently fighting extradition to America for allegedly hacking the US department of defence and other organisations, told of his ""shock, alarm and immediate concern and worry"" for Mr Hutchins. Mr Love, whose extradition appeal will be heard at the High Court later this year, said: ""Being in the US federal justice system is the thing that I've been trying to avoid for the last two years and (will) continue fighting to avoid in my High Court appeal, simply because it's not a place you want to be. ""In Marcus's case, he's facing charges for which there's been no evidence shown yet, but he could face sentences of up to 40 years. ""Whereas in the UK he would have a much more proportionate treatment - it's unlikely the charges would ever be brought, it's unlikely he'd be convicted. ""We've had this meeting to come up with ideas of how to support him and hopefully get him back to the UK as soon as possible, so that he can continue his invaluable work in security."" The east London meeting highlighted the ambiguities raised by the case of a respected security researcher being accused of creating malicious software. One attendee, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ""You have to understand there's going to be a number of people who are going to be quite torn. ""A number of people who day in, day out try to battle these threats. ""They're going to be saying 'I don't know whether he's guilty or not guilty, whether they do have a case'."" Mr Hutchins will appear in court in the US on Monday, where he is set to plead not guilty to six charges relating to the development and sale of banking malware."

The cases involve alleged victims as young as 12 being sold to families in the UK from Europe, and the NCA has launched an advertising campaign to raise awareness of the signs of modern slavery in everyday life. The most common nationalities of victims brought into the UK are people from Eastern Europe, Vietnam and Nigeria. Will Kerr, NCA director of vulnerabilities, said: ""The more that we look for modern slavery, the more we find evidence of the widespread abuse of the vulnerable. ""The growing body of evidence we are collecting points to the scale being far larger than anyone previously thought. ""This should not be acceptable in any way, shape or form."" Mr Kerr said there were ""lots of different outlets"" for people trafficked into the UK to be working illegally and against their will, with many affecting people in everyday life. Examples include those working at car washes and in industries like construction, agriculture and food processing. They often receive very little pay and are forced to put up with poor living conditions. Others sold into slavery could be kept in pop-up brothels, where sex workers promised a better life are instead left penniless, while some can be working in cannabis factories. ""As you go about your normal daily life and as you're engaged in a legitimate economy accessing goods and services, there is a growing and a good chance you will come across a victim who has been exploited in one of those different sectors,"" Mr Kerr said.

Mr Kerr said the scale of the problem was further complicated by the fact that some people do not realise they are a victim of slavery. He added: ""People are being exploited on an hourly and daily basis. ""The full scale and extent of it, we don't know. But what we have found is that in every medium-to-large town and every city in the UK, we have found evidence of vulnerable people being exploited. ""We can't put a figure on it but we can say there are tens of thousands of victims across the UK."" Signs of slavery include visible injuries, a distressed appearance and any indication they are being controlled by another person. Anyone with information about possible slavery gangs can contact the NCA on 08000 121 700."

One incident in March involved a candidate who was asked to stop the car after committing a number of serious errors. He swore at the examiner and then drove wildly across a dual carriageway - forcing the tester to use dual controls to bring the vehicle to a stop. The culprit was subsequently banned from taking future practical exams at a test centre in West Yorkshire, and he will be supervised during any future tests elsewhere. DVSA chief executive Gareth Llewellyn said: ""We do not tolerate anyone abusing, threatening or assaulting staff. ""Our message is clear - whatever has happened, don't take it out on our staff. If you do, we'll press for the strongest possible penalties."" Other DVSA workers, including vehicle testers and roadside enforcement staff, have also suffered abuse in their roles. A trial will see the agency's roadside workers wear body cameras, and the devices will be rolled out to include driving test examiners if they prove effective. Pete Williams, road safety spokesman for the RAC, said: ""Examiners at the DVSA play a vital role in ensuring the safety of drivers and vehicles on our roads on a daily basis. ""It's therefore disappointing to see such a marked increase in the level of verbal and physical abuse they are encountering from the very people they are trying to help. ""The majority of UK drivers and road users will wholeheartedly support a zero-tolerance approach to such behaviour."""

Four trials at Newcastle Crown Court heard how vulnerable girls were groomed by men who gave them alcohol and drugs before raping them at parties known as ""sessions"". In what is the largest sex abuse investigation the Northumbria force has ever undertaken, 461 arrests were made after 703 potential complainants came forward. Members of the gang have been imprisoned for a combined time of more than 300 years. At the final trial, 17 men and one women were convicted of, or admitted to, charges including rape, supplying drugs and inciting prostitution. Twenty young women told the court about the systematic abuse they had been subjected to over a number of years. They told how teenagers were plied with cocaine, cannabis, alcohol and the designer drug M-CAT(mephedrone) by the gang. They were then raped or persuaded into having sex with the lure of the drugs. Despite the convictions, there has been criticism of the Northumbria Police for paying a convicted child rapist almost £10,000 to spy on the parties. The trial heard that the informant had a previous conviction for drugging and raping an underage girl and inviting another man to do the same. ""The means can never justify the ends in a situation like this where you are putting a convicted child rapist in contact with very vulnerable children,"" said NSPCC spokesman Jon Brown said. ""It absolutely beggars belief and were are staggered at the NSPCC to understand that this has happened."" However, Chief Constable Steve Ashman suggested that the means justified the ends. ""I can categorically state that there are vulnerable women and girls today who have been safeguarded, and dangerous men behind bars, by using this tactic,"" he said. :: Snouts and narks: The murky world of police informants Jim Hope, Head of Complex Casework for the Crown Prosecution Service, paid tribute to the ""courageous"" victims. ""Many of those convicted during the course of these trails have systematically been groomed and abused: vulnerable teenage girls and young women over a number of years for their own (the gang's) sexual gratification. ""Despite the abuses they have suffered, the victims have demonstrated great bravery in recounting their own distressing experiences in court. ""Through their courageous actions they may well have prevented other vulnerable women and girls from falling victim to this group."" The Newcastle case is the biggest child sex investigation since the scandals in Rotherham and Rochdale. A report into the abuse in Rotherham, which came to light in November 2010, found that at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited between 1997 and 2013. It branded the local council ""not fit for purpose"". Then, in 2012, there was widespread public outrage after nine Asian men were jailed after grooming five girls - aged between 13 and 15 - in and around Rochdale between 2008 and 2010. Arrests or prosecutions of groups of men for similar abuse also took place in 11 towns and cities, including Oxford, Bristol and Aylesbury."

Passengers and witnesses reported shouting, smoke and ""lots of blood"" in the wake of the crash involving the route 77 bus. The driver was one of three people taken to hospital for further treatment, with a total of 10 people treated by paramedics. Passenger Andrew Matthews said there were around a dozen passengers on the bus and there was ""a lot of blood"" when the crash happened. The 34-year-old, who was at the back of the top deck, said: ""I noticed the bus drifting. I heard a smash and saw the roof of the shop going through (the bus) from the front left. It went to the fourth or fifth row. ""I wedged myself in, bracing myself. ""As soon as the bus came to a stop there was yelling, screaming. ""I noticed a lady wedged in the front right-hand side. She was screaming for help. There was a lot of blood."" Nurse Amy Mullineux was also on board, and said the driver told her he had lost consciousness. ""He said he blacked out before the bus hit the shop. He doesn't remember hitting anything,"" she said. ""The paramedic told me they think he had some kind of fit."" Solange Morin, who was hoping to catch the bus, said: ""I saw this woman (in the bus) shouting and banging on the glass. ""Everybody shouted 'fire, fire'. ""I went on to the bus. I talked to her and was holding her hands. ""She was pinned. I wouldn't have been able to get her out. She was so scared because people were shouting fire. There was a lot of smoke."" Photos on social media showed the bus, which was travelling towards Waterloo, on the pavement and smashed into the front of the Poggen Pohl Kitchen Design Centre. Shattered glass could be seen strewn across the ground. London Fire Brigade, London Ambulance Service and the Metropolitan Police all attended the incident. Transport for London said a ""full investigation is under way"", while Wandsworth Police wrote on Twitter that the road would be ""closed for some time""."

Lord Farmer, who performed the review, concluded good family relationships are ""indispensable"" for delivering the Government's plans to reform the prisons estate, which has been hit by surging levels of violence and self-harm. His report states: ""This would likely include most foreign nationals but also, for example, it might also be too disruptive for new babies, young children or teenagers studying for important exams to come into prison to visit at frequent intervals, but virtual visits would keep up the contact in the meantime."" Allowing prisoners access to video calling would also help ensure inmates ""do not become stuck in a technological dark age which will ill-equip them for life on the outside"", he adds. A Northern Ireland prison where inmates have been granted access to Skype to call their families was highlighted by the report. But Lord Farmer stressed ""virtual visits"" should not risk replacing face-to-face contact between inmates and their families. Research shows a prisoner who receives visits from a loved one is 39% less likely to reoffend than an inmate who had no such contact. Lord Farmer's report criticised ""unacceptable inconsistency"" on the issue of family links in jails. He suggested prisons should be judged on the rate of inmates who receive visits, with his review claiming there is ""little respect"" for family ties when the location of prisoners is decided. Lord Farmer said: ""My report is not sentimental about prisoners' families, as if they can, simply by their presence, alchemise a disposition to commit crime into one that is law abiding. ""However, I do want to hammer home a very simple principle of reform that needs to be a golden thread running through the prison system and the agencies that surround it. ""That principle is that relationships are fundamentally important if people are to change."" The Ministry of Justice said it has already taken steps to act on the review's recommendations. Justice Secretary David Lidington said: ""We are committed to transforming prisons into places of safety and reform and we recognise the need to provide those in our care with stable environments, and opportunities to change their behaviour."""

Vitamin B3 is found in meat and vegetables - and a single serving of Marmite contains 36% of a person's recommended daily allowance. The breakthrough has been described as ""one of the most significant discoveries in pregnancy research"", as the findings will transform the way expectant mothers are cared for. It emerged after a team of scientists investigated why some women suffer multiple miscarriages - and what causes children to be born with heart, kidney and spinal defects. Professor Sally Dunwoodie, a biomedical researcher at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Sydney, said: ""The ramifications are likely to be huge. ""This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use these words lightly."" One in five pregnant women currently suffer from a miscarriage, and an estimated 7.9 million babies worldwide are born with a serious birth defect every year. Annually, 3.3 million children aged under five die from a serious birth defect - and congenital heart disease, its most common form, affects one in 100 babies. Tests showed introducing vitamin B3 into the diet of pregnant mice ""completely prevented"" both miscarriages and defects - leading to all offspring being born ""perfectly healthy"". The researchers say their next step is to develop a test to help identify which women are most at risk from having a baby with a birth defect, and to then ensure they have sufficient vitamin B3. Professor Robert Graham, the institute's executive director, said: ""We believe that this breakthrough will be one of Australia's greatest medical discoveries. ""It's extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time. It's actually a double breakthrough."""

But six hospital trusts have not reported, and NHS England admitted that, once estimates were factored in, the overall figure would be over 4 million. The figures also show that NHS in England has missed its target for A&E waiting times for the second consecutive year. In July this year, 90.3% of patients spent four hours or less in A&E, missing the 95% target. The last time that was achieved was in July 2015. There were also 500,498 emergency admissions in July 2017 -- only the third time that emergency admissions have toppled half a million since records began. NHS England said it is ""working hard to cut long waits, and the number of patients waiting over a year for treatment has dropped by nearly 13,000 since March 2011 to being just over 1,500 now"". But the poor performance was immediately seized upon by Jeremy Corbyn, who is due to resume campaigning today with an attack on the Government's management of the NHS. ""NHS patients cannot afford another year of Theresa May,"" the Labour leader said. ""She has said she is 'proud' of the Conservative record on the NHS, but after a year in office, patients are waiting longer to be seen in A&E, longer for treatment and longer to be discharged. That is nothing to be proud of."" The Labour leader is due to visit the Royal Cornwall Hospital in one of Labour's target constituencies of Truro and Falmouth, and then join a rally of supporters. Labour seeks to target scores of marginal seats across the country to keep up the momentum from the General Election in June. The party has been focusing on the NHS in recent days, seeking to move past a row over Mr Corbyn's views on Venezuela and his failure to directly condemn President Nicolas Maduro for the escalating violence in the country. Mr Corbyn said Labour would inject £2bn into social care and lift the public sector pay cap. ""The NHS is simply not safe in the hands of the Conservatives. A Labour government will invest in our NHS so it can properly look after the vast majority of people who rely on it,"" he said. A spokesman for NHS England said nine out of 10 patients were being admitted, treated, and transferred or discharged from A&E within four hours, which was ""up on the May 2017 performance"". He said: ""Reducing delays for patients awaiting discharge from hospital remains a key priority ahead of winter, and it is positive that NHS-related delays are lower this year than last."""

But it still shed 25,000 current account customers and saw £400m worth of instant access savings withdrawn thanks to ""retail customer reaction to uncertainty"". The bank had put itself up for sale earlier this year but was ultimately rescued in a £700m deal involving existing US investors last month. The first half also saw the group's full-time workforce cut by nearly 900 to just over 3,300, and chief executive Liam Coleman has warned the bank will cut its headcount further as it looks to trim costs. This will mainly come from temporary staff and contractors as well as through leaving employees not being replaced. Mr Coleman said the lender had been on a ""challenging journey"". But he said it had proven ""resilient"", stating that while there is ""more hard work ahead… this is a great bank and we are positive about the future"". ""The vast majority of customers have remained very loyal as we have progressed the sale and capital raise process and I am extremely grateful for their ongoing support,"" he said. The rescue deal agreed last month allows the Co-op Bank to continue as a stand-alone business and gives company bosses time to further their cost-cutting efforts. But the agreement required the wider Co-op Group to reduce its stake in the bank from 20% to 1%, and also saw the bank's pension scheme separated from the rest of the Group, leaving the lender solely responsible for its employees' retirement savings."

Mr Blair, who moved his party to the centre and called it New Labour, remains a hate figure for many on the left, and has criticised current leader Jeremy Corbyn for being too left-wing. In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Reflections With Peter Hennessey, he said the first volume of a Trotsky trilogy by Isaac Deutscher was the first political book he read. He picked it up after performing at a gig with his student rock band Ugly Rumours. ""I literally didn't stop reading it all night. It opened a different world to me,"" he said. ""I suddenly thought the world's full of these extraordinary causes and injustices and here's this guy Trotsky who was so inspired by all of this that he went out to create the Russian revolution and change the world. ""It was like a light going on."" Within about a year, however, Mr Blair said he concluded that the ideology of the Bolshevik leader ""wasn't right"". He said that conversations with an Indian student, who warned him about the dangers of an all-powerful state, and the influence of his future wife Cherie Booth, whom he began dating then, quenched his enthusiasm for Marxist ideology. ""She was a sort of mainstream Labour person then and remained that literally all the way through,"" he said of his future wife. ""That was influential because obviously when we started going out together she was extremely critical of what she regarded as my sort of Oxford student socialism. So she made that very clear."" ""Even though over time I obviously left that side of politics behind, the notion of having a cause and a purpose and one bigger than yourself or your own ambition - and I think probably allied at the same time to coming to religious faith - that changed my life in that period,"" he said. With his brand of centrist politics, Mr Blair won three consecutive elections and served as prime minister from 1997 to 2007. Ultimately, his legacy was tarnished by his decision to follow George W Bush in the war in Iraq. Mr Blair said he scrutinised his stance ""all the time"" and insisted that, despite the mistakes that were made, he stands by his decision to go to war and topple the regime of Saddam Hussein. ""The thing that is, I think, difficult for people to accept is that I haven't changed my view that it was better that we removed him than not,"" he said. Among mistakes made around the conflict, he mentioned a failure to plan for what would happen after Saddam's removal and to understand ""the depth of the problem within the world of Islam and the Middle East"" in the aftermath of the war."

The fine takes the firm's penalties to £500,000, including a record £400,000 fine last year over a hacking attack that saw information for 157,000 customers compromised in October 2015. Forty Wipro employees had ""unjustifiably wide-ranging"" access to data belonging to between 25,000 and 50,000 TalkTalk customers, said the Information Commissioner's Office. Three of those accounts were then used to illegally access data of up to 21,000 customers. A TalkTalk spokesman said: ""We notified the ICO in 2014 of our suspicions that a small number of employees at one of our third-party suppliers were abusing their access to non-financial customer data. ""We informed our customers at the time and launched a thorough investigation, which has led to us withdrawing all customer service operations from India."" Customers had complained of calls from scammers identifying themselves as TalkTalk engineers. They said the scammers had information that was only accessible to the company, including details of previous support calls, and used this to gain their trust. Issuing the fine, the Information Commissioner's Office said it did not find any direct evidence of a link between the information accessed by Wipro staff and the complaints about scam calls. The commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: ""TalkTalk may consider themselves to be the victims here. But the real victims are the 21,000 people whose information was open to abuse by the malicious actions of a small number of people. ""TalkTalk should have known better and they should have put their customers first."""

During the trials, it was heard that Northumbria Police recruited a sex offender years after he drugged an underage girl and invited another man to rape her after he had done so. The convict, who can only be named as XY, was tasked to assist the force with its investigation into child sexual exploitation in Newcastle. Defending his force's use of an informant, Northumbria police chief constable Steve Ashman said he would ""not rule out"" using a convicted rapist to aid an investigation again. He said ""we have safeguarded vulnerable women and girls"" and ""dangerous men are behind bars"" because of the information gathered using the convicted rapist. Mr Ashman said: ""We have to step into a murky, dangerous and shadowy world and the people who are going to provide us with that information which will protect victims - it's not the post-master or the district nurse."" He went on to say: ""We were absolutely entitled to do what we did. The question that remains is a moral one: was it right to do that?"" Subsequent trials, which until now were unreportable, have heard girls were groomed by men who gave them cannabis, alcohol and the designer drug Mkat at parties, then encouraged them into having sex. Police said they found 278 victims and over the course of four trials 20 young women gave evidence. Those prosecuted were from the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish communities and mainly British-born, with most living in the west end of Newcastle. During pre-trial hearings, defence barristers argued the cases of more than 10 men should be thrown out due to the informant's involvement. Robin Patton, representing one of the defendants, said the public's confidence in the justice system would be ""substantially diminished"" if they knew police had recruited ""such an individual"". David Hislop QC, representing another defendant, said XY had 13 previous convictions, including 26 offences of dishonesty. :: Snouts and narks: The murky world of police informants It was heard that after his recruitment, the informant was arrested after a teenage girl claimed a man approached her and made an indecent proposition. He was later told he would face no action after he took part in an identity parade. During legal submissions, XY gave evidence to the court and made a series of lurid allegations against the police, including claims of racism and that he was asked to plant drugs. He claimed he was recruited because he acted as an informal taxi driver for some of the defendants and ""had to make it look like I was their friend"". Judge Penny Moreland rejected his evidence in its entirety, describing it as ""inherently unreliable"" and ""clearly dishonest"". Former undercover police officer Neil Woods, who used to recruit and pay police informants, described the method as the ""cheapest and most efficient way of solving crime"". He went on to say that ""the vast majority of informants are used for drug offences"", but only for robberies or sex crimes ""in rare cases"". Former detective chief inspector Chris Phillips, told Sky News: ""No officer would ever go into work thinking they were going to pay a convicted rapist money, but sometimes the needs are to get a prosecution, and you will only get that with enough information to put before a court. ""Countless lives have been saved by the use of informants, and if we have to pay £10,000 to get these people's locked up, I think it's money well spent."" In a statement, the NSPCC said it was ""appalled"" Northumbria Police recruited a convicted child rapist as an informant. ""It beggars belief that it would ever have been considered, let alone approved, and serious questions must be asked about the force's approach to child sexual exploitation operations,"" it said.

He sped around the sodden London track alone, crossing the line in 20.20 seconds to huge cheers, then immediately hit the floor and performed push-ups for the crowd. Makwala had been banned from competing in the 400m final just 24 hours earlier for staying in a team hotel where an outbreak of the norovirus occurred.

2017-08-11,"More than a decade into social media, we like to think we're pretty savvy by this point.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170811182250/http://news.sky.com/story/how-much-dirt-do-social-networks-have-on-you-10977974,"Sure, we give up some of our personal data, but we're wise to the deal - we get addictive, free apps and services in return. And what's a few silly photos? We can always remove them, or make them vanish, thanks to privacy controls. :: Google and Facebook could be fined billions under new law So the Government's Data Protection Bill, under which anyone can ask for personal information to be deleted, a ""right to be forgotten"", might seem like something nice, but niche. I wonder if we realise how much dirt the social networks actually have on us. It's not just photos and status updates - the information we consciously hand over. If you're a WhatsApp user, it knows your phone and, a lot of the time, it knows your location. It knows what news stories you like, which adverts you've clicked on. It knows which of your Facebook friends - or Instagram followers - you fancy. Facebook is ubiquitous around the internet so its shares buttons appear on news sites, or are used for ID. It follows you around the internet, tracking your every click. It then combines that information it gathers with third party sources like Experian, which builds up consumer profiles based on credit card spending and other sources. As John Lanchester writes in the London Review of Books: ""What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business."" But the same goes for all the tech giants - they're very, very thirsty for your personal information. So the right to be forgotten is something quite profound. First, you have the right to know what Facebook knows about you, not just what you've uploaded, but the conclusions that the company has drawn, then sold on to advertisers trying to sway you. Then you'll have the right for that information to be removed. That could represent a shift in our relation to the digital platforms that control much of the modern world. It will rely on people taking it up of course. You can already ask any company for the data it holds about you, for a £10 fee, under something called a Subject Access Request. Few do. (Even though you can find out how attractive, say, Tinder thinks you are.) The impulse here isn't a Luddite one. Data is becoming the fuel of the AI-based economy, the coal to the steam engines of a new industrial revolution. By giving consumers control of their data, it means businesses can be more confident in how they use it. Rather than pushing the boundaries of people's privacy, they know the data they do process is there by consent - and safe to use. That feeds into another part of the bill: making sure data can flow freely. This is crucial to the economy and something that might have been threatened by Brexit. That also illustrates another point. The Data Protection Bill is pretty much identical to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has to be, to ensure the flow of data. The GDPR also contains the ""right to erasure"", the right to be forgotten. It's been in the works since 2012 and has been more or less ignored by the mainstream media and general public.When a law is promulgated from Brussels, it's boring, bureaucratic meddling. When the British Government announces the same thing, it dominates headlines and strikes a blow for freedom. We're again realising, a little late, that the wonks in Brussels might have been on to something."

Images posted on social media showed one half of the semi-detached property in Rosslyn Avenue, Ryhope, reduced to a pile of rubble and significant damage to the second home, caused by the blast. One Facebook user claimed her sister was airlifted to hospital from the property and was ""conscious and talking"", adding that the victim's daughter was not at home at the time. In a post on a local community group, she wrote: ""There must b a God sum where, how the hell can anyone survive that explosion."" Local residents gathered outside their homes and looked on in horror. One tweeted: ""Right so it's just sounded like a bomb has exploded in ryhope; house literally shook."" right so it's just sounded like a bomb has exploded in ryhope; house literally shook Firefighters, police officers and paramedics were at the scene, which was sealed off.

Northumbria Police gave no details of what caused the explosion, but confirmed on Twitter that ""there is nothing to indicate at this time that this is linked to terrorism"". The force said everyone affected had been accounted for and there were no fatalities. Tracey Pounder, 51, who lives in a neighbouring street, said: ""I heard an almighty bang.

2017-08-11,"Hate crimes rose sharply following the series of terror attacks in the UK earlier this year, according to new figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170811182250/http://news.sky.com/story/hate-crime-levels-surged-in-days-after-uk-terror-attacks-10982952,"The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has revealed there was an increase in abuse in the days following the atrocities in Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge. There was no such increase following June's attack in Finsbury Park, north London, when a van was driven into Muslim worshippers. Police recorded 234 hate crime incidents 48 hours after the Westminster Bridge attack - with 273 reported following the Manchester bombing and 319 recorded two days after the London Bridge attack. On average, there were 171 hate crimes per day in 2016. The spikes were described as a ""real concern"" by police chiefs. The biggest increase came after the Manchester Arena bombing - the deadliest in the UK since the 2005 London bombings - with a 50% rise in hate crime in the week of the attack compared with a year before. The NPCC estimates the vast majority of increases were driven by race or faith hate crimes. Two days after the Finsbury Park attack, 223 incidents were reported - but the NPCC said the number of hate crime incidents was lower than average. The week of that attack saw a 7% fall in hate crime compared with the same week in 2016. The NPCC has urged some caution over the figures, as levels of hate crime tend to be higher in the summer and at weekends - such as when the London Bridge attack took place. More incidents are also reported when there is an increased visible police presence, as occurred in the aftermath of this year's attacks. The comparison with 2016's figures will also be affected by the spike following the EU referendum result and a difference in data collection between the two years, the NPCC added. Assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton, the NPCC's lead for hate crime, said: ""We know that terrorist attacks and other national and global events have the potential to trigger short-term spikes in hate crime and so we have been carefully monitoring community tensions following recent horrific events. ""Reporting from police forces show that levels of hate crime peaked in the wake of the attacks but quickly subsided within a few days. ""This is in line with trends we have seen before, though obviously still a real concern for the police service and wider society."" Baroness Williams of Trafford, the minister for countering extremism, said: ""All forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and those who commit these awful crimes should be met with the full force of the law. ""We are clear that a single hate crime attack is one too many and we will do everything we can to wipe out hatred and division in our communities."" Police urged anyone feeling vulnerable to hate crime to call 101 or visit the True Vision website."

He told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're at least 20 years into this, my guess is that we will still be dealing with the long tail in another 20 years time - I think this is genuinely a generational problem. ""I think that we are going to be facing 20 or 30 years of terrorist threats and therefore we need absolutely critically to persevere."" Lord Evans, who retired from the Security Service in 2013, said the 7/7 bombings in July 2005 triggered an ""energising effect on the extremist networks in the UK"", and thought there would be a similar feeling in the wake of the Westminster atrocity. ""We did see a huge upsurge in threat intelligence after 7 July and I suspect that there's the same sort of feeling in the period after the Westminster Bridge attack - that a lot of people who thought 'I'd like to do this' suddenly decided 'yep, if they can do it, then I can do it',"" he said. Since Khalid Masood's rampage, there have been attacks in Manchester, London Bridge and Finsbury Park. But Lord Evans said he did not think the security services were ""losing the race"" despite the recent spate of attacks. ""I don't think we are losing the race; I think that it is a race and we have to keep moving forward rapidly unless we are going to slip back,"" he said. ""There will be some capabilities that do get eroded and I think the widespread use of encryption has reduced the ability of the agencies and the police to access the content of materials."" In the wake of the attacks there have been calls for a weakening of the encryption on messaging platforms, but Lord Evans said he did not think this was the answer because ""there is a parallel issue which is cyber security more broadly"". ""I think the way in which cyberspace is being used by criminals and by governments is a potential threat to the UK's interests more widely and it's very important that we should be seen and be a country in which people can operate securely - I think that's very important for our commercial interests as well as for our national security interests."" Lord Evans said he was ""rather surprised"" that terrorists had not used a dirty bomb to attack the UK as ""it seems such a clear opportunity""."

About 700,000 eggs from the farms affected by the insecticide are thought to have been sent to the UK - far more than the 21,000 first estimated. EU health commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis said he wanted the summit to be held by the end of September. ""I proposed to hold a high-level meeting gathering the ministers concerned as well as the representatives of the food safety agencies in all member states involved as soon as we have all the facts available,"" he said in a statement. He also called for countries in Europe to work together to learn from the problem amid raised tensions between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany over who was at fault. ""Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,"" Mr Andriukaitis, the Lithuanian commissioner, said. ""We need to work together to draw lessons learnt and move forward instead of losing energy on finger pointing."" The European Commission says the contamination scare has affected 15 EU countries as well as Switzerland and Hong Kong. Several UK products, including salads sold at Sainbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda, have been removed following the contamination scare. There are concerns that many of the contaminated eggs will already have entered the food chain through processed foods that use eggs, such as biscuits and cakes. :: List of products withdrawn in egg contamination scare Fipronil is widely used to treat pets for ticks and flees but its use in any part of the food chain, for example to clean out barns, is forbidden. It is moderately toxic and can cause organ damage in humans, but a large number of contaminated eggs would need to be eaten for any negative health effects to be observed. The Food Standards Agency says it is ""very unlikely"" that the eggs posed a risk to public health. Two directors of the company at the centre of the scandal were arrested on Thursday by Dutch authorities. Prosecutors said they are suspected of threatening public health and possession of a prohibited pesticide."

Gina Martin, 25, started a petition to add 'upskirting' to the Sexual Offences Act 2003 - attracting 58,000 signatories. In a letter to Justice Secretary David Lidington, Mr Burgon urged the Government to close ""a gap in the law"" to offer women greater protection. ""I am writing in support of the campaign, started by Gina Martin, to make disgraceful, invasive upskirting photographs a sexual offence in law,"" he said. He noted that the practice of upskirt photos had increased with the development of mobile phone cameras, adding: ""At present, there is a gap in the law that has allowed - and is continuing to allow - people who have taken such photographs in public places to escape prosecution. ""This needs to be changed."" Ms Martin, writing on her online petition, said she saw the men sending an image taken up her skirt to each other and snatched one of their phones so she could report it to security. She said upskirt photographing can be prosecuted under different laws, such as provisions punishing voyeurism, if it happens in a private space; or ""outraging public decency"" if the act happens in a public place where at least two members of the public who were actually present at the time could have witnessed it. But neither one clearly covers a case of upskirt photograph. ""We want the law to specify clearly that this is a sexual offence with a victim,"" Ms Martin wrote on her petition. She told Sky News: ""Every woman I know has experienced sexual harassment on some level. ""I'm bored of women's bodies being public properties."""

However, inspectors say this work ""may not have occurred"". Southwark Council said it was ""not willing to take any risks"" and will move out residents in 242 flats ""over the coming weeks and months"". The authority is considering plans to permanently replace gas appliances with electric ones, and in the meantime is supplying hotplates and electric water heaters. Deputy leader Stephanie Cryan described the measures as a ""short term fix to a longer term problem"". ""We feel that with the gas supply shut off it is safe for people to stay if they wish to,"" she told Sky News. ""If people wish to move we will accommodate that for them."" Southwark Council said it initially hoped to fix the cracks while residents remained in their homes, but inspectors' findings ""means we are now planning to temporarily decant the blocks"". Alternative accommodation may need to be provided if the process to provide alternative power for the buildings takes too long, it added. Vaunda and Steve Hill, who live in Ledbury's Peterchurch block, told Sky News they were angry about the council's handling of the issue. ""This wasn't done off the council's back, it was because one resident kicked up a stir over it,"" Mrs Hill said.

The CAA's Richard Moriarty told Sky News: ""It is critical Heathrow raises its game in terms of the service it provides to disabled passengers. ""The good news is Heathrow recognises that, and Heathrow has put in place commitments and plans to do just that over the next year."" More than a million passengers who need extra assistance pass through the west London hub every year, which is more than any other European airport. But a survey of 1,200 disabled passengers at Heathrow found 62% rate it as ""poor"" or ""very poor"". A spokesperson for the airport said they were ""extremely disappointed"" with the findings, admitting they ""fall short"" of the passenger experience they aim to provide. ""We apologise to those who have been affected and are taking action, including the amendment and re-tendering of our contract with new and higher standards of service to ensure passengers receive the service they rightly deserve,"" they added. The UK's airports were graded based on a range of information - including how long passengers wait for assistance, how happy they are with the service, and how well the airport engages with disability organisations. The report found six airports - Inverness, Glasgow, Glasgow Prestwick, Humberside, Birmingham and Norwich - provide ""very good"" assistance. Another 20 airports were described as ""good"" - and London Gatwick was among them, where passengers with hidden disabilities such as autism are given special lanyards so staff are aware they may need extra support. Sara Marchant, a manager at Gatwick, said the airport holds regular meetings with disability groups to identify what needs to be done. Among the services is a family familiarisation day where children with autism can visit the airport before flying. She said: ""They can practise checking in, they can go for a ride in a buggy, they can practise going through security. ""All those things mean that when they come here to travel, children are more used to it, children understand what's happening and they've got that bit of experience."" Penny Wilkinson has two autistic children and says airports are often stressful and difficult. ""I would find it a lot easier if people were aware of their needs,"" she said. ""I think sometimes to be with crowds - if it's really busy or waiting a long time - they sometimes might have a little bit of a meltdown. ""So I feel a lot calmer in myself if staff are aware that they've got needs."" Disability charities broadly welcomed the findings of the report but added it's vital airports take action to improve. Selina Mills, from Leonard Cheshire Disability, said: ""You don't have to be specialist care trained to treat someone as an individual and to think about what they need. ""Everyone has difficulties in airports, they're complicated places but I think you just need to make sure your staff know what they're doing."" The CAA said it would continue to monitor standards. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""It is encouraging to see the overwhelming majority of UK airports providing a good service for passengers with a disability, but I am determined to push the aviation industry to do more."""

The couple were at the Logan's family home in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Ms Williams was rescued and treated in hospital, while Logan's parents suffered smoke inhalation. The family dog, Gomez, was also killed. Logan had pleaded guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder last month. He said he had poured the petrol in retaliation for being punched earlier by his brother, but had not intended to kill him. ""It was not my intent to kill him but I did do it,"" he told police. He was given a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years, reduced from 24 because of his early plea, at the High Court in Edinburgh. Judge Lady Scott said Cameron had died a ""horrible death"" and that his brother had ""acted with wicked recklessness"". During the trial, the court heard the two brothers had a ""hostile"" relationship, and Logan told police they had not spoken since the death of their grandmother in 2013. A computer seized from his bedroom showed that he had searched the internet for burn victims since October last year. Logan told police he thought that Ms Williams was out of the room, and also that he did not want to murder his parents, David and Catherine. Both parents, as well as Ms Williams, were in court. In a letter to the court, the parents said they ""find it extremely difficult to reconcile the Blair they know with the Blair who caused Cameron's death"". Defence QC Shelagh McCall said Logan had shown genuine remorse, and now viewed the murder of his brother as ""horrific"". On the night of the fire, Mrs Logan, awoken by the dog, ran out of the house to call for help from neighbours. Mr Logan tried to enter the living room, where the couple were sleeping on an inflatable mattress, but was beaten back by the intensity of the fire. Ms Logan was able to escape the room and go to the kitchen, where she protected herself by putting her head in the fridge. She suffered burns to her arms and face and has undergone surgery four times. She also damaged her throat, vocal cords and lungs, and due to the extent of her injuries, she may not be able to return to work as a broadcast journalist."

The footage shows his bloodied hands as he shouts: ""Dispatch, I'm hit!... I'm hit in my neck some place."" Mr Smith's terrified reflection can be seen in his car window as he continues to describe his wounds: ""My arms are broken. Help me please... I'm hurt pretty bad. My left arm is broken. I've been shot in the neck,"" he says. A passer-by comes to his aid and attempts to assure him: ""I've seen you after that boy. Seen you after him. I am going to stay here with you.""

Tell them to hurry up,"" he adds, his camera lens showing his blood-stained car door. ""Stay with me,"" the bystander pleads. ""Just concentrate on breathing. Hang in there."" As he is tended to by paramedics at the scene, Mr Smith urges them to ""secure my glasses, my body camera is on it"". The South Carolina officer survived, and months later, while giving evidence against Orr - the man who tried to kill him - Mr Smith described the camera glasses as the best $30 (£23) he had ever spent. The footage helped convict Orr, who was found guilty of attempted murder and possessing a weapon in a violent crime on Wednesday and sentenced to 35 years in prison."

The woman suffered minor injuries in the incident."

However, it hopes to redeploy some of the workers in other positions as it introduces 1,000 new senior supervisor roles and a ""significant amount"" of customer service positions. Wilko, which has 400 stores and employs 20,000 people, said it was ""introducing a new simplified retail team structure… to ensure it can operate successfully and competitively"". Retail director Anthony Houghton said: ""Despite the challenging retail landscape Wilko has seen both positive customer numbers and like-for-like sales growth this year. ""This is not translating into positive results despite all the hard work to reduce costs, grow own-brand and digital sales. ""Following independent studies we identified a legacy of retail structures that created complexity to manage which aren't simple, fair or transparent for our team members. ""The simpler, newly defined store structure will give teams greater variety within their roles and result in more team hours on the shop floor, delivering a better customer experience."" He said the company was working with the GMB trade union. Wilko said the announcement would not affect its commitment to the growth of the business, including new stores. The move comes after Wilko reported an 80% fall in pre-tax profits to £5.1m for the year to 28 January, pointing to political economic uncertainty, the collapse in sterling and the introduction of the national living wage. Retailers are being squeezed by a rise in costs thanks to the plunge in the pound since the Brexit vote. That has pushed up the cost of the goods they import while at the same time the firms are under pressure to keep down prices for their customers amid stiff competition."

""They think they can be used in this abhorrent sort of way where they can be seen as trash."" His comments come after 18 gang members - predominantly made up of men from a south Asian background - were convicted of the grooming, abuse and rape of women and girls as young as 15. Mr Shafiq added: ""It's important to address the central issue - why some people from our community think that children can be abused and raped in this disgusting sort of way… There is a process of education that has to go on."" However, he warned against the far right jumping on the issue, saying grooming ""affects all communities, and rather than pointing the finger at each other we should come together to defeat it"". President of Newcastle's Asian Society, Davender Kumar Ghai, also told Sky News ""it was about race"". He claimed some Muslim Asian men living ""in a ghetto in the West End"" (of Newcastle) ""call white women trash"". Mr Ghai said: ""The people are not very happy. It happened in Rochdale, it happened here. There is definitely something wrong. ""They call white women trash. That's a bad word to use. All the women are the same, and they should learn to respect them."" :: Members of the Newcastle grooming gang in profile Mr Ghai added: ""Islam is a good religion, but firstly, all these holy books - these clerics misinterpret them. And secondly there's no integration - they make a ghetto in the West End."" Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes told Sky News the case was not ""swept under the carpet"" because of race - and denied it was the defining factor linking the abusers. ""The thing that has linked these people is places like where they work, some of the social networks they move in."" ""These are people on the margins of criminality. These are people who've been dealing drugs. These are people who've been abusing women. This is not part of any mainstream religion."" Similar arrests and prosecutions for child sex abuse rings have taken place in 11 towns and cities across the UK over the last decade, including Oxford, Bristol and Peterborough. The Labour MP for Rotherham - where at least 1,400 children were sexually over 16 years - said there was a need to acknowledge that most perpetrators in grooming scandals ""have been British-Pakistani"". Sarah Champion said people were ""more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse"". She added: ""We've got now hundreds of men, Pakistani men, who have been convicted of this crime - why are we not commissioning research to see what's going on and how we need to change what's going on so it never happens again?"""

",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170811182250/http://news.sky.com/story/eu-countries-to-begin-returning-asylum-seekers-to-greece-10982453,"Officials say improved services mean it is appropriate to return individuals to Greece, under EU rules that state asylum seekers need to lodge their asylum application in the first country they arrive in. The requirement had been suspended as Greece struggled to deal with large numbers of asylum seekers, many fleeing conflict in Syria. But overcrowded and harsh conditions remain a problem, and humanitarian organisations have expressed doubts about whether Greek authorities are able to adequately support refugees. On Tuesday Berlin said it had asked Athens to take back 392 individuals, while other countries including the UK, France, the Netherlands and Norway have said they will seek to transfer smaller numbers. Boris Cheshirekov, a spokesperson for the UNHCR Greece, told Sky News that transfers would resume on a case-by-case basis, and that vulnerable groups such as disabled people and children would not be returned. ""The capacity of the Greek state has increased dramatically in the last year,"" he said, explaining that transfers will depend on an ""assurance"" by the Greek government. Authorities in Greece and other EU countries stress that only small numbers of people are likely to be sent back. Last month fears of overcrowding and neglect in Greece were highlighted by a riot at a camp in Lesbos, while many aid organisations have said that refugees struggle to access healthcare, work and shelter. George Kanaris, a welfare services coordinator at the Athens Solidarity Centre, told Sky News the situation in Greece was ""not ideal"" and expressed ""strong doubts"" that it was improving. ""It is not by chance they choose to leave the country"", he said, explaining that tough conditions and a feeling of ""desperation"" drive many to attempt to leave Greece for other states in Europe. Mr Kanaris argued it was ""against human rights"" to return asylum seekers after a ""perilous and very expensive trip"" from Greece and their countries of origin. The EU's executive arm recommended in December that the policy of returning asylum seekers be reinstated, and people who arrived in Greece after March 15 before travelling on to other countries are now liable to be returned. New arrivals continue to land in hotspots like Lesbos although in smaller numbers than 2015, when 800,000 arrived. Nearly 12,000 migrants have landed in Greece this year compared to 96,000 in Italy, and 2,420 have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean."

It is hoped the move will ensure humane standards of animal care, as well as hygiene and safety standards, according to an updated statutory animal welfare code. Any breaches could mean slaughterhouses receiving a welfare enforcement notice, the suspension of staff licenses or even a criminal investigation. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the moves would ensure food in the UK was produced to the ""very highest standard"" and would cement the UK's status as a ""global leader"" in animal welfare. Campaigners from animal rights groups have for years called for CCTV to be installed in slaughterhouses to protect against abuse and neglect. The demand has been highlighted by footage taken from smuggled cameras in slaughterhouses that reveal shocking animal abuse. One 2015 film in a Yorkshire abattoir showed animals being thrown and hit. British Veterinary Association president Gudrun Ravetz said the move would ""provide an essential tool in fostering a culture of compassion that could help safeguard animal welfare"". He added that the independence and qualifications of vets would ensure high standards are enforced. According to the Humane Society, 2.6 million cows, 10 million pigs and 950 million birds are slaughtered each year in the UK."

Birmingham City Council had promised to clear the backlog of uncollected bin bags by Friday. Javed Iqbal, of the Alum Rock Community Forum, told Sky News: ""It is disgusting, dangerous and we won't stand for it any longer. ""People are taking rubbish to the tips themselves but it isn't enough - it stinks. ""The council and the unions are as bad as each other. It has to be sorted out."" The long-running dispute between binmen and Birmingham City Council has meant some areas have not had bin collections for six weeks. If anything, the row over cuts and changes to the service deepened this week after unions revised strike times, which will result in even fewer official collections being made. Father-of-four Wayne McLeod showed Sky News the dozens of black smear marks on his walls where he kills the large flies that invade his Small Heath home every day. The 42-year-old forklift truck driver said: ""Every morning I have another six invading my home. ""Those mammoth flies that we have are carrying infection from month-old garbage. ""They are coming in and piercing my skin and I have pus coming out of my hands."" Ian Sharpe, who runs Environmental Pest Control in the north of Birmingham, told Sky News the piles of rubbish are a feeding bonanza for rodents and other vermin. He said: ""They can eat and drink until their heart's content so it is like a rat hotel. ""A happy rat is going to breed more often and their litters are going to be bigger. ""They can have anything up to 14 babies in any one go and in five weeks those rats are sexually active."" Birmingham City Council claims to have collected bins on more than 75% of roads - a claim branded as ""lies"" by many residents. The strike action is expected to continue each working day until 1 September at least."

""It's an ideal high-energy food for Antarctic conditions, and is still a favourite item on modern trips to the Ice."" The cake and its tin have been taken to New Zealand's Canterbury Museum laboratory, where the Trust's staff are working on conserving almost 1,500 artefacts. Scott's expedition had a number of objectives, but reaching the pole was key - and although they ultimately succeeded they found that the Norwegians had beaten them to it.

2017-08-11,"Officially they are known rather grandly as Covert Human Intelligence Sources, but to the rest of us they are snouts, grasses or coppers' narks.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170811182250/http://news.sky.com/story/police-informants-where-should-line-be-drawn-10980924,"Especially to those who remember The Sweeney, the hard-hitting 1970s TV drama about the Flying Squad that often shone a light on the murky world of police informants. People give police information for a variety of reasons - for money, to remove a rival, or to get a cut in their own sentence. If an informant helps the conviction of others, police can give the judge a ""text"" - a letter - outlining the cooperation in expectation of a reduced sentence for their snout. It's become big business for the police, though it's a subject they are reluctant to discuss in detail. A recent Freedom of Information request revealed that UK forces spent £20m in five years on payments to informants. Most informants have some criminal past and one drugs squad detective I knew viewed anyone he arrested as a potential snout. Former Flying Squad detective Peter Kirkham told me: ""In broad terms you set a thief to catch a thief, but it's usually more complicated than that. If you want to know about criminality you need to get information from someone involved in that criminality."" When Mr Kirkham began his detective career 30 years ago there were few checks on how officers used informants. A detective kept the source secret and recorded no details of their meetings or payments. It was an unregulated system that was open to abuse, from both sides. The Scotland Yard investigation into the notorious 1987 axe murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan was condemned years later when it was revealed that a detective had ""coached"" his informant. In the 1990s the Yard was found to be using Jamaican Yardie gangsters as informants without realising they were carrying on their life of crime at the same time. The Yardie case led to stringent oversight of the informant system, with new rules and a code of practice. The latest Home Office guidelines set out strict procedures to be followed, especially on the use of juvenile informants. Yes, police are allowed to use children as their narks, with certain caveats. The Home Office guidelines say: ""On no occasion should the use or conduct of a CHIS under 16 years of age be authorised to give information against their parents or any person who has parental responsibility for them."" Is there a line to be to be drawn anywhere over the use of informants? Can anyone, whatever their past, be hired by police to help them convict other criminals? :: Child rapist paid £10k to spy on underage 'sex parties' An informant in the Newcastle child sex case, a convicted child rapist, claimed during a pre-trial hearing that Northumbria Police had paid him £10,000 for information about the sexual exploitation of young girls. He said part of his work included going to parties where police suspected girls would be intoxicated and sexually abused. Peter Kirkham said: ""I can't see any circumstances where somebody with his previous convictions would be approved as a participating informant to go to places where that sort of thing was happening. ""If the police had reasonable grounds to suspect what was going on they could not have allowed that to happen. ""It's not like me letting a villain steal a car for an armed robbery. In a case like that I would let the theft go ahead because it would lead me to a robbery where I could intervene and arrest more serious villains."" The Newcastle case is the biggest child sex investigation since the Rotherham and Rochdale grooming scandals and involved the trial of 25 suspects. Former North West chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who led the Rochdale prosecution in 2012, said: ""Putting a child sex offender in contact with children and other sex offenders is a line I would not cross. ""It is an ethical issue, but there is also the question of the danger to the children from someone who has already been convicted. My experience shows such men continue to offend. ""You need to be very wary. I can't think of anything that could be done to manage the very obvious risks."""

One of the victims, who worked for the family for 26 years, was ordered to dig his own grave and told ""that's where you're going"" if he did not sign a false work contract. Eleven gang members have been convicted of fraud and slavery charges and the full scale of their offending can only now be reported after a ruling at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday. Operating from sites in Lincolnshire, they targeted victims who were homeless, had learning disabilities or complex drug and alcohol issues. Eighteen victims, men aged 18 to 64, were freed following raids by Lincolnshire Police and the National Crime Agency in 2014. :: Modern slavery cases 'in every large town and city' in UK The gang also targeted four elderly homeowners, getting them to sign over properties into their names and then selling three on for a profit, one for £250,000. One of these victims ended up dying without his family knowing, and it was only when relatives contacted police that they discovered they had missed his funeral. The gang would search for victims on the streets and in hostels and shelters, offering work for food and accommodation at sites in Drinsey Nook and Washingborough. The men were forced to work at the sites or for the Rooneys' businesses, repairing properties and tarmacking drives. But even though the offers of fair work for fair pay were quickly exposed as lies, they kept their victims ""financially trapped"" and under total control using false promises, drugs, alcohol and violence. Labourers were forced to live in shabby run-down caravans or in stables next to kennels, with little or no access to heating, water or toilets. Police said the victims were poorly fed - often being given the family's leftovers - even though they worked for hours doing hard, manual tasks without safety equipment or the right clothing. The gang controlled many of the victims' bank accounts, with the money being used to pay for gym memberships, football schools and building materials. The Rooneys also used ""threats"" and ""violence"", including punishment beatings, and the victims were denied medical help. The impact on the victims was severe, with many suffering mental and physical torment during their ""gruelling and emotional"" ordeal, according to police. By contrast, members of the gang enjoyed luxurious holidays to Australia, Egypt and Mexico, high-performance BMWs, spa days and cosmetic surgery. As part of their operation to smash the slavery ring, police recovered £100,000 worth of stolen goods, including four caravans, three jackhammers, 70 packs of bricks, a labrador and Lincoln's cemetery gates. It was a far cry from what Chief Superintendent Nikki Mayo, who led the investigation, described as the ""suffering"" inflicted on the men they employed, adding many of the victims had now ""got their lives back"". The 11 family members convicted were: :: John Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby, Lincolnshire - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, conspiracy to defraud, fraud by false representation and two counts of theft. :: Patrick Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, fraud by abuse of position, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and two counts of theft. :: Bridget Rooney, 55, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. :: Martin Rooney, 35, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield - conspiracy to defraud, two counts of converting criminal property. :: Martin Rooney, 57, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour and unlawful wounding. :: Martin Rooney, 23, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. :: Patrick Rooney, 54, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire - converting criminal property. :: John Rooney, 53, of Chantry Croft, Pontefract, Yorkshire - two counts of conspiring to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. :: Peter Doran, 36, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. :: Gerard Rooney, 46, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. :: Lawrence Rooney, 47, currently in prison - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour."

The US President's warning came hours after China appealed to the US and North Korea ""to be cautious with their words and actions"" amid heightened nuclear tensions. On Thursday, Mr Trump met with national security advisers to discuss Pyongyang's threat to fire missiles towards the US territory of Guam. In an address after the meeting, the President suggested his warning to hit North Korea with ""fire and fury"" may not have been tough enough. In a subsequent attempt to ease tensions, defence secretary James Mattis told reporters that the US still prefers a diplomatic approach to easing tensions as a war would be ""catastrophic"". However, when asked whether America was prepared to respond if North Korea commits a hostile act, he replied: ""We are ready."" :: The flaws in Trump's North Korea approach Later, Pyongyang accused Washington of a ""criminal attempt to impose nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation"" and described the US as a ""heinous nuclear war fanatic"". Mr Trump's ""locked and loaded"" threat was met with a mixed reaction among world leaders. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the President's escalation of rhetoric was ""the wrong answer"", adding: ""I do not see a military solution and I don't think it's called for"". Meanwhile, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the threats from Washington and Pyongyang were ""going over the top"". :: Why is North Korea threatening to strike Guam? He added that ""the side that is stronger and cleverer"" should take the first step to defuse the crisis. The latest war of words between the US and North Korea started after the latter test-fired two missiles in July. Despite the tensions, American and South Korean officials say they still plan to stage joint military drills from 21 August. Washington and Seoul say the annual exercises, which involve tens of thousands of troops, are defensive in nature and crucial to maintaining a deterrent against North Korean aggression."

It is also handing the scheme a one-third stake in the ongoing UK operations, which include the giant Port Talbot steel works in south Wales. The announcement formally confirms details of a deal called a Regulated Apportionment Agreement (RAA), a mechanism allowing a financially troubled employer to detach itself from defined benefit scheme liabilities. Tata Steel said the agreement offered ""more sustainable outcomes for pensioners, employees and the business"". It will offer members the choice either to transfer a new pension scheme sponsored by Tata, under which they will see lower future increases to their pensions than would otherwise be the case. If they choose not to they could remain in the existing scheme which will transfer to the ""lifeboat"" Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The benefits offered by the new scheme are expected to be better for most members than those on offer for those from the PPF. Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director, said it was ""one important milestone in Tata Steel UK's journey towards a sustainable and enduring future"". He added: ""Considering the continued challenges in the global steel industry as well as the uncertain global political-economic environment, the RAA represents the best possible structural outcome for the members of the British Steel Pension Scheme and for the Tata Steel UK business."" The GMB, Unite and Community unions said in a joint statement: ""For over a year our members have feared for their security in retirement, and this announcement helps to bring that uncertainty to an end."" RAAs can be controversial because they are supposed to be approved by the industry regulator only when ""the alternative would have to be that the employer would become insolvent"". The Pensions Regulator (TPR), which has approved the Tata deal, said it offered greater certainty to members. TPR chief executive Lesley Titcomb said: ""We do not agree to these types of arrangements lightly but after several months of robust negotiations in this case, we believe that it is the best possible outcome for everyone involved in what is a very difficult situation."" The crisis at Britain's biggest steel producer erupted last year, when Tata put its entire UK operations up for sale amid a deteriorating industry environment. In February, the company's British employees voted to accept proposals to close the existing pension scheme to new contributions, in exchange for greater certainty about the future of its 8,500-strong workforce. Tata Steel said more than a year ago that it would seek to merge its European operations with the steel division of Germany's Thyssenkrupp. Doubts have arisen in recent weeks about whether the merger will proceed, however, even with a resolution of the pension issues."

Fillery was jailed for eight years, while Winter and Nguyen were each sentenced to five years in prison. Sentencing them at Salisbury Crown Court, Judge Keith Cutler said: ""Each of you has played a part in what amounts to one of the most serious crimes that this area has seen for a long while. ""Chilmark is essentially an English village, picture book beauty. It's also the spiritual home for Wiltshire as Salisbury Cathedral is built from Chilmark stone. ""In return you in your own way have decided to use this large nuclear bunker to carry out the production on an industrial scale of cannabis."" The farm was capable of producing £2m worth of cannabis each year, the court heard. The area had been ""built and designed as a nuclear bunker to be used by important personnel coming from the Army headquarters in the event of a nuclear war,"" said Charles Thomas, prosecuting. The building was decommissioned in the 1990s. According to Mr Thomas, Fillery leased the building in 2013 and originally used it as a storage facility for his business selling movie and TV memorabilia. But in February, following a tip-off by a delivery driver who reported a cannabis smell, police found 4,425 plants at all stages of production. They also found 6,500 dead used plants with a total value of £1.25m. Mr Thomas said that about 20kg of harvested and dried cannabis was also found, with a value of about £99,000. ""That puts the enterprise in category A of the guidelines as a production of cannabis on an industrial scale,"" he said. Fillery, of Ashcott, Bridgwater, Somerset, was also found in possession of criminal property - movie memorabilia worth £1m - at his home. Fillery had a ""leading role"", according to the prosecutor, while Winter, of Maytree Avenue, Bristol, provided transport and Nguyen, of Horfield, Bristol, acted as a liaison. Wiltshire Police dropped charges of modern slavery - stemming from the presence in the farm of four Vietnamese men employed as gardeners - due to a lack of evidence."

""We have a lot of questions for Mr Lathem and Mr Warren and we look forward to their return to Chicago."" Warren is reportedly from Swindon in Wiltshire and has been suspended from his job as senior treasury assistant. He left the UK on 24 July for the US and was reported missing to UK police a day later, two days before Mr Cornell-Duranleau's body was found. After the hearing, Warren's lawyer, Ariel Boyce-Smith, said his client was ""agreeable"" to being moved to Chicago. ""He wants the process to be started. ""I just want to remind everyone that he is presumed innocent and his agreement to go there to start the process is where we are now."" The lawyer acting for Lathem, who has been sacked from his microbiology post at Northwestern University, said that he plans to plead not guilty. Kenneth Wine has described his client as a ""gentle soul"". Neither of the suspects have been formally charged."
2017-08-12,An increasing number of laser pen attacks on pilots and train drivers has led the government to look at new measures to tackle rogue use.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170812184508/http://news.sky.com/story/laser-pen-attacks-govt-to-consider-new-rules-10984517,"Among the moves that could be considered are licensing for retailers and shoppers, such as the systems that already exist in some other countries. The news comes after a number of airline pilots have expressed fears about the use of lasers, which can cause eye damage and even temporary blindness. There were 1,258 laser attacks reported on aircraft in the UK last year, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. British Transport Police said there were 466 laser incidents recorded between 1 April 2011 and 31 October 2016. Shining lasers at aircraft can incur a fine of up to £2,500. But moves to make it easier for police to prove the offence were dropped by the Government after June's election. Business Minister Margot James has launched an eight-week call for evidence, saying: ""Public safety is of the utmost importance and we must look carefully to make sure regulations are keeping up with the increased use of these devices. ""Whilst we know most users don't intend any harm, many are not aware of the safety risks and serious health implications of shining laser pointers directly into people's eyes. ""Used irresponsibly or maliciously, these products can and do wreak havoc and harm others, with potentially catastrophic consequences. ""That's why we want to hear from business groups, retailers and consumers about the best way to protect the public from this kind of dangerous behaviour and improve safety."" Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association, said: ""Startling, dazzling and distracting a pilot at a critical stage of flight has the potential to cause a crash and loss of life. ""This is especially a problem for helicopters, which operate close to the ground and are sometimes single-pilot operations. ""There is also a growing concern that, as the power of available lasers increases, the possibility of permanent damage being caused to pilots' and passengers' eyes increases."""

He told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're at least 20 years into this, my guess is that we will still be dealing with the long tail in another 20 years time - I think this is genuinely a generational problem. ""I think that we are going to be facing 20 or 30 years of terrorist threats and therefore we need absolutely critically to persevere."" Lord Evans, who retired from the Security Service in 2013, said the 7/7 bombings in July 2005 triggered an ""energising effect on the extremist networks in the UK"", and thought there would be a similar feeling in the wake of the Westminster atrocity. ""We did see a huge upsurge in threat intelligence after 7 July and I suspect that there's the same sort of feeling in the period after the Westminster Bridge attack - that a lot of people who thought 'I'd like to do this' suddenly decided 'yep, if they can do it, then I can do it',"" he said. Since Khalid Masood's rampage, there have been attacks in Manchester, London Bridge and Finsbury Park. But Lord Evans said he did not think the security services were ""losing the race"" despite the recent spate of attacks. ""I don't think we are losing the race; I think that it is a race and we have to keep moving forward rapidly unless we are going to slip back,"" he said. ""There will be some capabilities that do get eroded and I think the widespread use of encryption has reduced the ability of the agencies and the police to access the content of materials."" In the wake of the attacks there have been calls for a weakening of the encryption on messaging platforms, but Lord Evans said he did not think this was the answer because ""there is a parallel issue which is cyber security more broadly"". ""I think the way in which cyberspace is being used by criminals and by governments is a potential threat to the UK's interests more widely and it's very important that we should be seen and be a country in which people can operate securely - I think that's very important for our commercial interests as well as for our national security interests."" Lord Evans said he was ""rather surprised"" that terrorists had not used a dirty bomb to attack the UK as ""it seems such a clear opportunity""."

Feels rose from number three, while Despacito fell to number four, after an impressive run at the helm. The Puerto Rican reggaeton beat had already been named the summer's biggest hit, having surpassed Justin Bieber's Sorry as the most streamed track ever, with 4.6 billion streams across platforms such as YouTube and Spotify. Feels marks the eighth UK number one hit for Harris, meaning he has the second highest number of chart-topping singles for a British male solo artist behind Sir Cliff Richard, who has 14 chart-toppers under his belt. It also means the DJ is now on par with the Rolling Stones, who also have eight number one hits in the country. Harris' previous number ones include Dance Wiv Me, We Found Love and Sweet Nothing. The top five of the singles chart this week has French Montana's Unforgettable featuring Swae Lee at number two, while Wild Thoughts, by DJ Khaled, Rihanna and Bryson Tiller moved to number three. Meanwhile in the Official Albums Chart, Ed Sheeran's third album Divide was back at number one after a brief dip in popularity, while Arcade Fire's Everything Now - last week's number one - was in third place, below Glen Campbell's 64th and final album Adios. Following the US singer's death last week, the June record rose 11 places up the charts to reach a new peak of number two."

He was released on the same day pending further inquiries. On Friday, Eric Bellquist released a statement through his lawyers saying he had ""irrefutable proof"" he was in the US at the time. A Met Police statement said: ""Following enquiries, he has now been eliminated from the investigation. ""Enquiries continue to identify the jogger who pushed the female pedestrian into the road."" The 33-year-old victim was walking across Putney Bridge at about 7.40am on 5 May, when the incident occurred. According to the Met Police, the runner appeared to push her, knocking her into the road. She was walking toward the Putney Bridge tube station side of the Thames at the time, and the jogger was heading towards Putney. The bus she narrowly avoided stopped and some passengers got off, rushing to the victim's aid. She suffered minor injuries, a force statement said. About 15 minutes after the incident occurred, the jogger came back across the bridge, towards Fulham and Chelsea. The victim attempted to speak to him but he did not acknowledge her and continued running, the Met said. Officers are continuing to appeal for information and asked anyone who knows who he is to get in touch. The jogger is described as a white man, aged in his early- to mid-30s, with brown eyes and short brown hair. He was wearing a grey t-shirt and dark blue shorts."

One of the victims, who worked for the family for 26 years, was ordered to dig his own grave and told ""that's where you're going"" if he did not sign a false work contract. Eleven gang members have been convicted of fraud and slavery charges and the full scale of their offending can only now be reported after a ruling at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday. Operating from sites in Lincolnshire, they targeted victims who were homeless, had learning disabilities or complex drug and alcohol issues. Eighteen victims, men aged 18 to 64, were freed following raids by Lincolnshire Police and the National Crime Agency in 2014. :: Modern slavery cases 'in every large town and city' in UK The gang also targeted four elderly homeowners, getting them to sign over properties into their names and then selling three on for a profit, one for £250,000. One of these victims ended up dying without his family knowing, and it was only when relatives contacted police that they discovered they had missed his funeral. The gang would search for victims on the streets and in hostels and shelters, offering work for food and accommodation at sites in Drinsey Nook and Washingborough. The men were forced to work at the sites or for the Rooneys' businesses, repairing properties and tarmacking drives. But even though the offers of fair work for fair pay were quickly exposed as lies, they kept their victims ""financially trapped"" and under total control using false promises, drugs, alcohol and violence. Labourers were forced to live in shabby run-down caravans or in stables next to kennels, with little or no access to heating, water or toilets. Police said the victims were poorly fed - often being given the family's leftovers - even though they worked for hours doing hard, manual tasks without safety equipment or the right clothing. The gang controlled many of the victims' bank accounts, with the money being used to pay for gym memberships, football schools and building materials. The Rooneys also used ""threats"" and ""violence"", including punishment beatings, and the victims were denied medical help. The impact on the victims was severe, with many suffering mental and physical torment during their ""gruelling and emotional"" ordeal, according to police. By contrast, members of the gang enjoyed luxurious holidays to Australia, Egypt and Mexico, high-performance BMWs, spa days and cosmetic surgery. As part of their operation to smash the slavery ring, police recovered £100,000 worth of stolen goods, including four caravans, three jackhammers, 70 packs of bricks, a labrador and Lincoln's cemetery gates. It was a far cry from what Chief Superintendent Nikki Mayo, who led the investigation, described as the ""suffering"" inflicted on the men they employed, adding many of the victims had now ""got their lives back"". The 11 family members convicted were: :: John Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby, Lincolnshire - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, conspiracy to defraud, fraud by false representation and two counts of theft. :: Patrick Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, fraud by abuse of position, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and two counts of theft. :: Bridget Rooney, 55, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. :: Martin Rooney, 35, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield - conspiracy to defraud, two counts of converting criminal property. :: Martin Rooney, 57, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour and unlawful wounding. :: Martin Rooney, 23, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. :: Patrick Rooney, 54, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire - converting criminal property. :: John Rooney, 53, of Chantry Croft, Pontefract, Yorkshire - two counts of conspiring to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. :: Peter Doran, 36, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. :: Gerard Rooney, 46, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. :: Lawrence Rooney, 47, currently in prison - conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour."

However, police have so far been unable to track her down. Divers have been sent down to the submarine but have not been able to gain entry. Mr Madsen escaped on Friday afternoon after the 18-metre UC3 Nautilus, considered to be the largest of its kind in the world, developed problems in Koge Bay, south of the Danish capital. Two helicopters, three ships and members of the public were involved in the search after the journalist's boyfriend reported the sub had not returned from the trip, which had apparently set sail from Refshale Island at 7pm on Thursday. Mr Madsen escaped the sinking submarine on a private boat and told Denmark's TV2 channel there had been a problem with a ballast tank. He said it took about 30 seconds to sink: ""I couldn't close any hatches or anything. But I guess that was pretty good because otherwise I still would have been down there."" ""Whether the woman was on board the submarine at the time of her disappearance is unclear,"" Swedish police said in a statement. Authorities said they might have to tow the submarine to port before they can get inside. The journalist, who has not been named, had been writing about Mr Madsen and the submarine, according to Danish and Swedish media. Copenhagen police are appealing for anyone who may have seen her to contact them. They described her as ""160cm tall, 56kg, 30 years old, with reddish-brown hair and green eyes"". She was wearing an orange blouse with long sleeves, a black and white floral skirt, nylon stockings and white tennis shoes. According to a profile on TedxVilnius, Mr Madsen is ""an explorer, who excels in making fantastic dreams come true"" and is also said to be working on designing a spaceship."
2017-08-12,"Officially they are known rather grandly as Covert Human Intelligence Sources, but to the rest of us they are snouts, grasses or coppers' narks.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170812184508/http://news.sky.com/story/police-informants-where-should-line-be-drawn-10980924,"Especially to those who remember The Sweeney, the hard-hitting 1970s TV drama about the Flying Squad that often shone a light on the murky world of police informants. People give police information for a variety of reasons - for money, to remove a rival, or to get a cut in their own sentence. If an informant helps the conviction of others, police can give the judge a ""text"" - a letter - outlining the cooperation in expectation of a reduced sentence for their snout. It's become big business for the police, though it's a subject they are reluctant to discuss in detail. A recent Freedom of Information request revealed that UK forces spent £20m in five years on payments to informants. Most informants have some criminal past and one drugs squad detective I knew viewed anyone he arrested as a potential snout. Former Flying Squad detective Peter Kirkham told me: ""In broad terms you set a thief to catch a thief, but it's usually more complicated than that. If you want to know about criminality you need to get information from someone involved in that criminality."" When Mr Kirkham began his detective career 30 years ago there were few checks on how officers used informants. A detective kept the source secret and recorded no details of their meetings or payments. It was an unregulated system that was open to abuse, from both sides. The Scotland Yard investigation into the notorious 1987 axe murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan was condemned years later when it was revealed that a detective had ""coached"" his informant. In the 1990s the Yard was found to be using Jamaican Yardie gangsters as informants without realising they were carrying on their life of crime at the same time. The Yardie case led to stringent oversight of the informant system, with new rules and a code of practice. The latest Home Office guidelines set out strict procedures to be followed, especially on the use of juvenile informants. Yes, police are allowed to use children as their narks, with certain caveats. The Home Office guidelines say: ""On no occasion should the use or conduct of a CHIS under 16 years of age be authorised to give information against their parents or any person who has parental responsibility for them."" Is there a line to be to be drawn anywhere over the use of informants? Can anyone, whatever their past, be hired by police to help them convict other criminals? :: Child rapist paid £10k to spy on underage 'sex parties' An informant in the Newcastle child sex case, a convicted child rapist, claimed during a pre-trial hearing that Northumbria Police had paid him £10,000 for information about the sexual exploitation of young girls. He said part of his work included going to parties where police suspected girls would be intoxicated and sexually abused. Peter Kirkham said: ""I can't see any circumstances where somebody with his previous convictions would be approved as a participating informant to go to places where that sort of thing was happening. ""If the police had reasonable grounds to suspect what was going on they could not have allowed that to happen. ""It's not like me letting a villain steal a car for an armed robbery. In a case like that I would let the theft go ahead because it would lead me to a robbery where I could intervene and arrest more serious villains."" The Newcastle case is the biggest child sex investigation since the Rotherham and Rochdale grooming scandals and involved the trial of 25 suspects. Former North West chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who led the Rochdale prosecution in 2012, said: ""Putting a child sex offender in contact with children and other sex offenders is a line I would not cross. ""It is an ethical issue, but there is also the question of the danger to the children from someone who has already been convicted. My experience shows such men continue to offend. ""You need to be very wary. I can't think of anything that could be done to manage the very obvious risks."""

He was sentenced at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Friday to 20 weeks, suspended for 12 months, and 200 hours community service. Former Hollyoaks actress Miss Davis said McConnell had threatened to throw acid in her face during a drink and drug-fuelled argument at her home in Merseyside. The judge was shown photos of a bruise on her arm that Miss Davis said was caused by McConnell biting her, as well as extensive bruises to the rest of her body and legs. The couple had been out for a meal with friends in Liverpool to celebrate Miss Davis's 24th birthday but when they returned home McConnell left to go to the pub with two of the friends. Miss Davis said he returned home and had been taking cocaine. ""He was calling me a slag,"" she said. ""He said that I was fat, he said that no one was going to want to touch me again."" Miss Davis said McConnell left the house again but later returned and began kicking the doors in an attempt to get in. She said she let him in because she was scared he would smash the glass patio doors. He followed her upstairs where she was in the bedroom holding their eight-week-old son, Caben-Albi. The court heard McConnell punched Miss Davis in the head and pushed her against the wall twice as she held their baby. The judge imposed a restraining order on McConnell for three years, banning him from contacting Miss Davis except through intermediaries and for the purpose of contact with their child. The judge told McConnell he had shown no remorse and attacked his ex-girlfriend as she held their baby in her arms. McConnell told the court he was defending himself against Miss Davis, who attacked him after learning he had taken cocaine. The pair met on Celebrity Big Brother in 2016. James Morris, mitigating for McConnell, told the court the 27-year-old's upbringing and a series of personal family tragedies had left him with ""demons""."

But they will no longer be told they should have babies without this intervention. Professor Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the college, denied the campaign had compromised safety but said she did not want women to feel they had ""failed"" if they had not had a normal birth. She told The Times: ""There was a danger that if you just talk about normal births, and particularly if you call it a campaign, it kind of sounds as if you're only interested in women who have a vaginal birth without intervention. ""What we don't want to do is in any way contribute to any sense that a woman has failed because she hasn't had a normal birth. ""Unfortunately that seems to be how some women feel."" The campaign drew criticism after an inquiry into the deaths of 11 babies and one mother at the Morecambe Bay trust between 2004 and 2013. The inquiry found the desire for natural deliveries at any cost among midwives had contributed to unsafe births. Prof Warwick said she does not believe midwives would have understood the campaign as meaning that normal birth should be pushed for ""beyond the point of safety"". She said: ""Clearly some midwives were identified as doing that at Morecambe Bay but I've got no evidence that was fostered by anything the RCM was doing."""

And what's a few silly photos? We can always remove them, or make them vanish, thanks to privacy controls. :: Google and Facebook could be fined billions under new law So the Government's Data Protection Bill, under which anyone can ask for personal information to be deleted, a ""right to be forgotten"", might seem like something nice, but niche. I wonder if we realise how much dirt the social networks actually have on us. It's not just photos and status updates - the information we consciously hand over. If you're a WhatsApp user, it knows your phone and, a lot of the time, it knows your location. It knows what news stories you like, which adverts you've clicked on. It knows which of your Facebook friends - or Instagram followers - you fancy. Facebook is ubiquitous around the internet so its shares buttons appear on news sites, or are used for ID. It follows you around the internet, tracking your every click. It then combines that information it gathers with third party sources like Experian, which builds up consumer profiles based on credit card spending and other sources. As John Lanchester writes in the London Review of Books: ""What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business."" But the same goes for all the tech giants - they're very, very thirsty for your personal information. So the right to be forgotten is something quite profound. First, you have the right to know what Facebook knows about you, not just what you've uploaded, but the conclusions that the company has drawn, then sold on to advertisers trying to sway you. Then you'll have the right for that information to be removed. That could represent a shift in our relation to the digital platforms that control much of the modern world. It will rely on people taking it up of course. You can already ask any company for the data it holds about you, for a £10 fee, under something called a Subject Access Request. Few do. (Even though you can find out how attractive, say, Tinder thinks you are.) The impulse here isn't a Luddite one. Data is becoming the fuel of the AI-based economy, the coal to the steam engines of a new industrial revolution. By giving consumers control of their data, it means businesses can be more confident in how they use it. Rather than pushing the boundaries of people's privacy, they know the data they do process is there by consent - and safe to use. That feeds into another part of the bill: making sure data can flow freely. This is crucial to the economy and something that might have been threatened by Brexit. That also illustrates another point. The Data Protection Bill is pretty much identical to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has to be, to ensure the flow of data. The GDPR also contains the ""right to erasure"", the right to be forgotten. It's been in the works since 2012 and has been more or less ignored by the mainstream media and general public.When a law is promulgated from Brussels, it's boring, bureaucratic meddling. When the British Government announces the same thing, it dominates headlines and strikes a blow for freedom. We're again realising, a little late, that the wonks in Brussels might have been on to something."

On an cloudy August Saturday in north London, I travelled to a disused office block to watch Momentum activists be schooled in how to win an election. The grassroots, left-wing movement, founded two years ago to help Jeremy Corbyn as leader has announced it is embarking on training members in more than 160 marginal constituencies over the next year. Beth Foster-Ogg, Momentum's training coordinator, told me: ""This election showed what a groundswell of ordinary people, knocking on doors and campaigning for the Labour Party can do. ""Now we want to skill up the hundreds of thousands of new Labour Party members so they can be better, more effective campaigners. ""When the next election comes, and so they can campaign and organise in their communities outside of election time."" Momentum, now with tens of thousands of members, is adapting Bernie Sanders-style campaigning. The organisation is combining traditional political techniques while producing high quality social media videos which are going viral. But it is not without its critics, who view it as a Trojan horse within Labour. They fear activists have taken over the party and are now planning the deselection of MPs. Which some have claimed could lead to civil war within Labour. No-one could deny in these febrile political times, it's clear Momentum are living up their name. With a weaken, diminished Conservative Party, whose membership are older and nowhere near as big, Momentum hope their renewed campaigning could help tip the balance in the next political battle."
2017-08-12,"Supplies of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, in the UK have outstripped fossil fuels this summer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170812184508/http://news.sky.com/story/record-breaking-summer-for-renewable-power-generation-10984525,"On 26 May, solar panels produced more than a quarter of all electricity needed in the country, with windy and bright conditions helping renewable energy generation to smash records. And for the first time on 7 June, wind, nuclear and solar were all generating more than gas and coal combined. The falling cost of wind and solar technology makes it increasingly attractive and energy firms have installed tens of thousands of solar panels in recent years. The home roof market has also boomed with an estimated 900,000 systems now online, despite generous government subsidies all but drying up in the last two years. Dunsfold Aerodrome near Guildford, also known as the Top Gear race track, built a 8500 panel solar farm at the beginning of the revolution. The aerodrome's group operations manager said this would not have been possible back in 2011 without the grants available at the time but it has worked out well. Jamie McAllister told Sky News: ""Like all big renewable infrastructure projects it is a multi-million pound project but it does work in that it produces energy on site rather than taking it from the grid which is cheaper. ""Not only is it a renewable source but it is financially attractive which means it is good for us and good for the businesses based on site."" Critics have said the end of subsidies has had an impact but the industry has continued to grow. Ministers recently earmarked hundreds of millions of pounds to develop storage systems instead and analysts agree that storing our own electricity is the key to our solar future. James Court from the Renewable Energy Association said: ""Renewables don't always produce when you want them to so storage will help that problem hugely - both at a larger grid scale but also people in their homes. ""We're already seeing this year that you'll be able to buy a battery pack that is smaller than your boiler and you will be able to store the electricity that you generate in your home and that's going to change the entire market."" Meanwhile, National Grid has been planning how to deal with the next solar eclipse over the UK, which will take place the UK is expected to be far more reliant on solar power. The electricity management company has estimated that the amount of electricity produced from solar panels will more than double between now and when the eclipse is expected. So they are making plans for how to manage demand for the hour-or-so during which the country will be plunged into darkness at around 7pm on 12 August 2026. Claire Spredding from the National Grid said: ""One of our scenarios that we're planning for is that we'll have more than double the amount of solar generation than we have now. ""We think we could have around 3.5 gigawatts of solar generation that's on the system at that time that will obviously stop generating when the eclipse happens. ""So now we're working on making sure other sources are online at that time to keep up with demand."" :: US set for great eclipse National Grid is used to planning for major events in their high tech control room. Feeds monitor how much energy is needed and where it is coming from second by second. But the need to think about solar eclipses is new and a sign that renewable energy such as solar is becoming more important."
2017-08-12,The world was treated to a dazzling solar display on Friday night - as the Perseids meteor shower geared up for its weekend peak.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170812184508/http://news.sky.com/story/perseid-meteor-shower-previews-dazzling-august-peak-10984634,"Streaks of shooting stars - up to 100 an hour - are expected on Saturday and Sunday night in the most popular annual solar performance. The skies of Bosnia and Herzegovina were pictured filled with bright fireballs. Distinctive for their long ""wakes"" of light and colour streaking behind, the Perseids occur every August because of the warm summer weather. That makes them easily viewable for most sky-watchers, who will get the best display between 11pm and 3am in the Northern Hemisphere. For the best view, stargazers should find an area well away from city or street lights, which cause light pollution and diminish visibility. NASA advises it takes 30 minutes looking into the dark night's sky for people's eyes to adjust to see fainter objects. With the Saturday night weather forecast showing largely clear and dry spells, many in the UK may be lucky enough to marvel at the meteor shower. Meteor showers occur when the Earth orbits the sun, passing through the debris left by comet trails formed of broken asteroids. When the space rock collides with Earth's atmosphere, fiery and colourful streaks are created in the sky."

Since it became an American territory in 1898, Guam has been considered a vital asset by Washington. It lies in the Pacific east of the Philippines and around 1,700 miles south of North Korea. Its proximity to China, Japan and the Korean Peninsula hand the US a launching pad into Asia and as such it has been built up into a military fortress. :: North Korea 'examining' plan to strike Guam The US runs a naval base and Coast Guard station in the south of the island, as well as an air force base in the north which was regularly used during the Vietnam War. Based at the stations are around 6,000 US troops, with the military second only to tourism in terms of net contribution to Guam's economy. The bases cover 30% of the entire island, which is roughly the size of Chicago and has a population of 162,000. While it gives the US the capability to launch strikes in Asia, Guam also serves an important defensive function for Washington and its allies. In 2013, the US Army's Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system was deployed to the island - giving Washington the power to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles. :: Trump's fighting talk on N Korea may prove wise This makes it a target for Pyongyang, as does its remoteness. Residents on the island described their fears after getting caught in the middle of a war of words between Washington and Pyongyang. Cecil Chugrad, a 37-year-old bus driver, said: ""I'm a little worried, a little panicked. Is this really going to happen? ""If it's just me, I don't mind, but I have to worry about my son. I feel like moving (out of Guam) now."" Lawyer Todd Thompson said he laughed off Pyongyang's past threats but was worried with Donald Trump's handling of tensions. ""I'm not laughing now,"" he said. ""My concern is that things have changed in Washington, and who knows what's going to happen?"" His brother Mitch added he believes many on the island ""have no confidence that the White House will do the right thing under the circumstances"". Reacting to North Korea's threat of a military strike, Guam governor Eddie Calvo reminded Americans in mainland USA that the island is ""not just a military installation"". He said: ""I have reached out to the White House this morning. ""An attack or threat to Guam is a threat or attack on the United States. They have said that America will be defended."""

Biologically speaking, the fish convert their anaerobically produced lactic acid into ethanol which diffuses across their gills into the surrounding water. The researchers from the Universities of Oslo and Liverpool have discovered the unusual molecular mechanism behind this unique ability. They have pinpointed sets of proteins which are normally used to produce energy by channelling carbohydrates towards their breakdown within a cell's mitochondria. While one set of those proteins is very similar to what other species of vertebrate possess, the second set is uniquely activated by the absence of oxygen. Dr Michael Berenbrink, an evolutionary physiologist at the University of Liverpool, said that the blood alcohol concentration in these fish can exceed the drink-drive limit during the winter. ""During their time in oxygen-free water in ice-covered ponds, which can last for several months in their northern European habitat, blood alcohol concentrations in crucian carp can reach more than 50mg per 100 millilitres,"" said Dr Berenbrink. ""However, this is still a much better situation than filling up with lactic acid, which is the metabolic end product for other vertebrates, including humans, when devoid of oxygen."" Lead author Dr Cathrine Elisabeth Fagernes, from the University of Oslo, said: ""The ethanol production allows the crucian carp to be the only fish species surviving and exploiting these harsh environments. ""Thereby avoiding competition and escaping predation by other fish species with which they normally interact in better oxygenated waters. ""It's no wonder then that the crucian carp's cousin the goldfish is arguably one of the most resilient pets under human care."""

Fillery was jailed for eight years, while Winter and Nguyen were each sentenced to five years in prison. Sentencing them at Salisbury Crown Court, Judge Keith Cutler said: ""Each of you has played a part in what amounts to one of the most serious crimes that this area has seen for a long while. ""Chilmark is essentially an English village, picture book beauty. It's also the spiritual home for Wiltshire as Salisbury Cathedral is built from Chilmark stone. ""In return you in your own way have decided to use this large nuclear bunker to carry out the production on an industrial scale of cannabis."" The farm was capable of producing £2m worth of cannabis each year, the court heard. The area had been ""built and designed as a nuclear bunker to be used by important personnel coming from the Army headquarters in the event of a nuclear war,"" said Charles Thomas, prosecuting. The building was decommissioned in the 1990s. According to Mr Thomas, Fillery leased the building in 2013 and originally used it as a storage facility for his business selling movie and TV memorabilia. But in February, following a tip-off by a delivery driver who reported a cannabis smell, police found 4,425 plants at all stages of production. They also found 6,500 dead used plants with a total value of £1.25m. Mr Thomas said that about 20kg of harvested and dried cannabis was also found, with a value of about £99,000. ""That puts the enterprise in category A of the guidelines as a production of cannabis on an industrial scale,"" he said. Fillery, of Ashcott, Bridgwater, Somerset, was also found in possession of criminal property - movie memorabilia worth £1m - at his home. Fillery had a ""leading role"", according to the prosecutor, while Winter, of Maytree Avenue, Bristol, provided transport and Nguyen, of Horfield, Bristol, acted as a liaison. Wiltshire Police dropped charges of modern slavery - stemming from the presence in the farm of four Vietnamese men employed as gardeners - due to a lack of evidence."

Type 2 diabetes, which is most common in adults, occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate its blood sugar levels and can be linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity. A report by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) found 621 children and young people under 25 received care for Type 2 diabetes in paediatric diabetic units in England and Wales in 2015/16, of which 78.5% were also obese. That compares to 545 people in 2014/15. Fifteen children with the condition were aged between five and nine last year. It is believed that the true total could be higher as the RCPCH audit only covered those being treated in hospital units rather than by their GP. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, chairman of the LGA's Community Wellbeing Board, said: ""These figures show a hugely disturbing trend in the increasing number of children and teenagers being treated in Paediatric Diabetes Units for Type 2 diabetes, a condition normally only associated with adults. ""Obesity is usually linked with major health conditions later on in life, but already we are seeing the devastating consequences at an early age."" The LGA warned that cuts to council public health grants were impacting on their ability to fight childhood obesity. Libby Dowling, senior clinical advisor for the charity Diabetes UK, said: ""It is extremely worrying that more young people are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, especially as we know that for nearly 80% obesity is the likely cause for developing the condition. ""Some of the risk factors for Type 2 diabetes are out of our control, but we can do something about being overweight or obese which is one of the most significant risk factors. ""It's shocking that children are having to struggle with a condition that could have been prevented."" The Department of Health said it had a ""clear and comprehensive"" commitment to tackling childhood obesity. ""To halt this trend in future, we are delivering what public health experts call the world's most ambitious plans on childhood obesity and diabetes prevention,"" a spokesman said. ""We have introduced a soft drinks industry levy as well as an extensive sugar reformulation programme - these are already delivering results: in the past year Nestle, Lucozade Ribena Suntory, Tesco, Waitrose, Kellogg's and Sainsbury's have all committed to cutting sugar in their products."""

Alternative accommodation may need to be provided if the process to provide alternative power for the buildings takes too long, it added. Vaunda and Steve Hill, who live in Ledbury's Peterchurch block, told Sky News they were angry about the council's handling of the issue. ""This wasn't done off the council's back, it was because one resident kicked up a stir over it,"" Mrs Hill said.

It was active in rebel-held eastern Aleppo before the territory was seized by forces loyal to President Bashar al Assad. The SCD receives millions of pounds worth of funding from many Western government including the UK and the US. The White Helmets said in a statement: ""The civil defence centre in Sarmin was the target of an armed attack by unknown assailants in which seven volunteers were killed. ""Two minibuses, some white helmets and walkie-talkies were stolen."" It was not immediately clear whether the raid was carried out for political or criminal motives.

The observatory's director, Rami Abdel Rahman, said: ""Colleagues came in the morning for the change of shift and found them dead."" The White Helmets emerged in 2013, working to rescue civilians in many rebel-held areas. They have since gained widespread international renown for their daring rescues, with footage often taken and circulated on social media. Although its volunteers work in exclusively rebel-held areas, the group insists it is not partisan. President Bashar al Assad's government, meanwhile, accuses the group of faking videos and being a tool of its international donors. Independent Western media outlets say state-linked Russian news agencies have accused the SCD of being frauds as part of a systematic information war against it. Critics have also claimed rebel fighters, including jihadists, operate in their ranks.

But in a news conference on Sunday, he took issue at journalists who questioned whether links with Salazar, who is being investigated by the US anti-doping agency, had harmed his career. ""It's like I have achieved what I have achieved and you are trying to destroy it,"" he said. ""You guys, so many times towards me, you have been unfair. I don't know why."" Later, Sir Mo, thumping his chest and with tears in his eyes, said: ""Over the years you guys have done many things to build a person up and then bring them back down and the reality is... I'm going to still keep working, keep fighting and making my country proud. ""You can write what you like, I'm a clean athlete and as long as I understand that I sleep well at night."" Sir Mo described the repeated focus on Salazar, who is reportedly being investigated over supplements and banned drugs being given to athletes under his care, as like a ""broken record"". He added that Salazar had not been at any races with him this season and he had not decided yet whether he will use his support as he starts to tackle road racing. ""For the last three or four years I have been pretty much by myself and it didn't make much difference really - I knew what I needed to do,"" he said. At the World Championships in London, the ongoing controversy appeared not to have dampened the enthusiasm of his many fans. As he made his way around the stadium for a lap of honour on Saturday, he was embraced by members of the crowd who asked for autographs and selfies. Later in the evening, the same crowd booed US sprinter Justin Gatlin, who has twice been banned for doping offences, as he took part in the 4x100m relay, as he had been when he took gold in the 100m."

He joined Instagram in the run up to June's election and has 40,000 followers - 22,000 more than the Prime Minister. Some see the ""young fogey"" MP as a right-wing antidote to the popularity of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn. The Old Etonian, who recently announced the birth of his sixth child - Sixtus Dominic Boniface Christopher - is reportedly ""sounding out"" friends about whether he should go for it, according to The Sunday Times. Meanwhile, academic Ted Malloch told the Mail on Sunday that Mr Rees-Mogg had let slip his leadership ambitions during a private lunch. ""I was at a lunch with Jacob very recently and he indicated he would like to be considered for the leadership when the time comes,"" Professor Malloch said. ""He did not mean now, but at some point in the future."" And a friend of the MP quoted in the Sunday Times said Mr Rees-Mogg was ""loyal to a fault"" and would not do anything to ""destabilise"" Mrs May. They added however: ""But should she stand aside ... he is starting to look at some of his more ambitious peers and wonder what they have got that he hasn't"". Responding to the reports, Mr Rees-Mogg played down such talk, but pointedly did not explicitly rule out standing for the leadership. ""I think if I threw my hat in the ring, my hat would be thrown back at me pretty quickly,"" he said."

Assistant Chief Constable Jason Harwin said: ""We will absolutely not tolerate violence of this nature and we will work to identify the offenders and bring them to justice. ""The vast majority of fans accept that football is a family game, watched by children, parents and grandparents.

2017-08-13,An increasing number of laser pen attacks on pilots and train drivers has led the government to look at new measures to tackle rogue use.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170813215507/http://news.sky.com/story/laser-pen-attacks-govt-to-consider-new-rules-10984517,"Among the moves that could be considered are licensing for retailers and shoppers, such as the systems that already exist in some other countries. The news comes after a number of airline pilots have expressed fears about the use of lasers, which can cause eye damage and even temporary blindness. There were 1,258 laser attacks reported on aircraft in the UK last year, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. British Transport Police said there were 466 laser incidents recorded between 1 April 2011 and 31 October 2016. Shining lasers at aircraft can incur a fine of up to £2,500. But moves to make it easier for police to prove the offence were dropped by the Government after June's election. Business Minister Margot James has launched an eight-week call for evidence, saying: ""Public safety is of the utmost importance and we must look carefully to make sure regulations are keeping up with the increased use of these devices. ""Whilst we know most users don't intend any harm, many are not aware of the safety risks and serious health implications of shining laser pointers directly into people's eyes. ""Used irresponsibly or maliciously, these products can and do wreak havoc and harm others, with potentially catastrophic consequences. ""That's why we want to hear from business groups, retailers and consumers about the best way to protect the public from this kind of dangerous behaviour and improve safety."" Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association, said: ""Startling, dazzling and distracting a pilot at a critical stage of flight has the potential to cause a crash and loss of life. ""This is especially a problem for helicopters, which operate close to the ground and are sometimes single-pilot operations. ""There is also a growing concern that, as the power of available lasers increases, the possibility of permanent damage being caused to pilots' and passengers' eyes increases."""

Feels rose from number three, while Despacito fell to number four, after an impressive run at the helm. The Puerto Rican reggaeton beat had already been named the summer's biggest hit, having surpassed Justin Bieber's Sorry as the most streamed track ever, with 4.6 billion streams across platforms such as YouTube and Spotify. Feels marks the eighth UK number one hit for Harris, meaning he has the second highest number of chart-topping singles for a British male solo artist behind Sir Cliff Richard, who has 14 chart-toppers under his belt. It also means the DJ is now on par with the Rolling Stones, who also have eight number one hits in the country. Harris' previous number ones include Dance Wiv Me, We Found Love and Sweet Nothing. The top five of the singles chart this week has French Montana's Unforgettable featuring Swae Lee at number two, while Wild Thoughts, by DJ Khaled, Rihanna and Bryson Tiller moved to number three. Meanwhile in the Official Albums Chart, Ed Sheeran's third album Divide was back at number one after a brief dip in popularity, while Arcade Fire's Everything Now - last week's number one - was in third place, below Glen Campbell's 64th and final album Adios. Following the US singer's death last week, the June record rose 11 places up the charts to reach a new peak of number two."

2017-08-13,"More than a decade into social media, we like to think we're pretty savvy by this point.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170813215507/http://news.sky.com/story/how-much-dirt-do-social-networks-have-on-you-10977974,"Sure, we give up some of our personal data, but we're wise to the deal - we get addictive, free apps and services in return. And what's a few silly photos? We can always remove them, or make them vanish, thanks to privacy controls. :: Google and Facebook could be fined billions under new law So the Government's Data Protection Bill, under which anyone can ask for personal information to be deleted, a ""right to be forgotten"", might seem like something nice, but niche. I wonder if we realise how much dirt the social networks actually have on us. It's not just photos and status updates - the information we consciously hand over. If you're a WhatsApp user, it knows your phone and, a lot of the time, it knows your location. It knows what news stories you like, which adverts you've clicked on. It knows which of your Facebook friends - or Instagram followers - you fancy. Facebook is ubiquitous around the internet so its shares buttons appear on news sites, or are used for ID. It follows you around the internet, tracking your every click. It then combines that information it gathers with third party sources like Experian, which builds up consumer profiles based on credit card spending and other sources. As John Lanchester writes in the London Review of Books: ""What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business."" But the same goes for all the tech giants - they're very, very thirsty for your personal information. So the right to be forgotten is something quite profound. First, you have the right to know what Facebook knows about you, not just what you've uploaded, but the conclusions that the company has drawn, then sold on to advertisers trying to sway you. Then you'll have the right for that information to be removed. That could represent a shift in our relation to the digital platforms that control much of the modern world. It will rely on people taking it up of course. You can already ask any company for the data it holds about you, for a £10 fee, under something called a Subject Access Request. Few do. (Even though you can find out how attractive, say, Tinder thinks you are.) The impulse here isn't a Luddite one. Data is becoming the fuel of the AI-based economy, the coal to the steam engines of a new industrial revolution. By giving consumers control of their data, it means businesses can be more confident in how they use it. Rather than pushing the boundaries of people's privacy, they know the data they do process is there by consent - and safe to use. That feeds into another part of the bill: making sure data can flow freely. This is crucial to the economy and something that might have been threatened by Brexit. That also illustrates another point. The Data Protection Bill is pretty much identical to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has to be, to ensure the flow of data. The GDPR also contains the ""right to erasure"", the right to be forgotten. It's been in the works since 2012 and has been more or less ignored by the mainstream media and general public.When a law is promulgated from Brussels, it's boring, bureaucratic meddling. When the British Government announces the same thing, it dominates headlines and strikes a blow for freedom. We're again realising, a little late, that the wonks in Brussels might have been on to something."

Type 2 diabetes, which is most common in adults, occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate its blood sugar levels and can be linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity. A report by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) found 621 children and young people under 25 received care for Type 2 diabetes in paediatric diabetic units in England and Wales in 2015/16, of which 78.5% were also obese. That compares to 545 people in 2014/15. Fifteen children with the condition were aged between five and nine last year. It is believed that the true total could be higher as the RCPCH audit only covered those being treated in hospital units rather than by their GP. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, chairman of the LGA's Community Wellbeing Board, said: ""These figures show a hugely disturbing trend in the increasing number of children and teenagers being treated in Paediatric Diabetes Units for Type 2 diabetes, a condition normally only associated with adults. ""Obesity is usually linked with major health conditions later on in life, but already we are seeing the devastating consequences at an early age."" The LGA warned that cuts to council public health grants were impacting on their ability to fight childhood obesity. Libby Dowling, senior clinical advisor for the charity Diabetes UK, said: ""It is extremely worrying that more young people are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, especially as we know that for nearly 80% obesity is the likely cause for developing the condition. ""Some of the risk factors for Type 2 diabetes are out of our control, but we can do something about being overweight or obese which is one of the most significant risk factors. ""It's shocking that children are having to struggle with a condition that could have been prevented."" The Department of Health said it had a ""clear and comprehensive"" commitment to tackling childhood obesity. ""To halt this trend in future, we are delivering what public health experts call the world's most ambitious plans on childhood obesity and diabetes prevention,"" a spokesman said. ""We have introduced a soft drinks industry levy as well as an extensive sugar reformulation programme - these are already delivering results: in the past year Nestle, Lucozade Ribena Suntory, Tesco, Waitrose, Kellogg's and Sainsbury's have all committed to cutting sugar in their products."""

Mr Hammond and Mr Fox write: ""We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation. ""We will leave the single market, because there was a vote for change on June 23 and that is what we will deliver. ""We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change.

""But we are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU."" The joint statement from those who represent Remain and Leave within the Cabinet comes as Theresa May returns from her walking holiday in Switzerland this week.

These include papers on the issue of the Irish border as well as a paper on the ""future partnership"" arrangements, including the UK's proposals for a new customs agreement with the EU. The new detailed proposals come as Mr Davis prepares to embark on a third round of talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier in the Belgian capital at the end of the month. Mr Barnier has expressed his disappointment that the first two rounds of talks have failed to produce sufficient clarity on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's ""divorce bill"". Sources at the Department for Exiting the EU said the ""future partnership"" papers would show that the Government is ready to move on to the next stage of the negotiations.

""I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.

Ms Waters has called Islam ""evil"" and set up the Sharia Watch pressure group. She is one of 11 candidates who has been cleared to run in the leadership contest by the UKIP national executive committee. Mr Hookem said he was not prepared to ""turn a blind eye"" to extremism. In a statement, he said: ""I strongly disagree with the views Ms Waters and Mr Agnew promote and I would like to put as much distance between me and them as possible. ""If I were to continue in my position of deputy whip, I would be seen as supporting or at the very least turning a blind eye to extreme views and this is not something I am prepared to do. ""I am not a racist and have never campaigned on race issues. While I do believe in controlled immigration, this position is about 'space rather than race'; and I am not prepared to support someone who seeks to single out a section of our society simply due to their religious beliefs."" Mr Hookem resigned after the party's deputy leader Peter Whittle defended Ms Waters' right to stand as a candidate. Mr Whittle, who is also running for leadership, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ""The whole thing was done very rigorously. :: UKIP MEP Bill Etheridge drops out of leadership race ""There was a vetting process. We all had to go through it and if you all get through that then you absolutely have the right to stand. That means Anne Marie should be able to stand.""

In reference to his resignation letter, he said: ""Let Agnew add this to his scrapbook!"" The party has been divided by Ms Waters' candidacy with some members threatening to resign and former leader Nigel Farage has warned UKIP will be ""finished"" if it became an anti-Islam party. Mr Hookem told Sky News that UKIP had a policy on Islam which did not go down well on the doorstep at the last election. He said: ""You cannot attack one section of society. We are against mass immigration, we are talking about jobs and people taking the jobs of British people.

2017-08-13,A court has ruled that a Danish inventor can be held for 24 days while police investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170813215507/http://news.sky.com/story/sunken-submarine-owner-peter-madsen-held-over-missing-swedish-journalist-kim-wall-10985490,"Peter Madsen, 46, was arrested on preliminary manslaughter charges on Friday after he was rescued from his home-made submarine when it sank off Denmark's eastern coast. He denies any involvement in the disappearance of 30-year-old Kim Wall who had been on board the 60ft-long vessel before it sank. Ms Wall had been writing about Madsen for a story and is believed to have set sail with him from Refshale Island at 7pm on Thursday. Her boyfriend reported her missing in the early hours of Friday morning saying she had failed to return from her trip. But Madsen says he returned Ms Wall to land at 10.30pm on Thursday and has denied any involvement in her disappearance. A search for the missing submarine was launched after Ms Wall's boyfriend raised the alarm. The Navy said the US3 Nautilus was initially seen sailing normally but sank shortly afterwards in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen. Madsen escaped from the submarine as it sank and was rescued by a private boat. He told Denmark's TV2 channel there had been a problem with a ballast tank and that it only took 30 seconds for the sub to sink. A salvage vessel has raised the sub to the surface where it is expected to be transported back to land at some point. The decision to rescind Madsen in custody for a further 24 days was made by a judge after a two-hour custody hearing. Madsen's defence lawyer said her client maintains he is innocent but is ""willing to cooperate"" and has not decided whether to appeal the ruling. Copenhagen police have appealed for anyone who may have seen Ms Wall to contact them. They described her as ""160cm tall, 56kg, 30 years old, with reddish-brown hair and green eyes"". She was wearing an orange blouse with long sleeves, a black and white floral skirt, nylon stockings and white tennis shoes when she disappeared. According to her family Ms Wall lived in New York and Beijing, and had written for The New York Times, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post and Vice Magazine, among others."

On an cloudy August Saturday in north London, I travelled to a disused office block to watch Momentum activists be schooled in how to win an election. The grassroots, left-wing movement, founded two years ago to help Jeremy Corbyn as leader has announced it is embarking on training members in more than 160 marginal constituencies over the next year. Beth Foster-Ogg, Momentum's training coordinator, told me: ""This election showed what a groundswell of ordinary people, knocking on doors and campaigning for the Labour Party can do. ""Now we want to skill up the hundreds of thousands of new Labour Party members so they can be better, more effective campaigners. ""When the next election comes, and so they can campaign and organise in their communities outside of election time."" Momentum, now with tens of thousands of members, is adapting Bernie Sanders-style campaigning. The organisation is combining traditional political techniques while producing high quality social media videos which are going viral. But it is not without its critics, who view it as a Trojan horse within Labour. They fear activists have taken over the party and are now planning the deselection of MPs. Which some have claimed could lead to civil war within Labour. No-one could deny in these febrile political times, it's clear Momentum are living up their name. With a weaken, diminished Conservative Party, whose membership are older and nowhere near as big, Momentum hope their renewed campaigning could help tip the balance in the next political battle."

The motorbike driver could see the bag moving and hear cries from inside it when he collected it, the Beijing Times said - but was ordered not to open it by the baby's mother. It was only when he arrived at the Children's Welfare Institute in Fuzhou that staff unwrapped the parcel and made the shock discovery. In video posted on social media, the rescued baby is seen wrapped in blankets on a road-side, being treated with a cotton bud dipped in water. Police in the south-eastern province soon arrived and rushed the infant to hospital. In a statement, they said the child's vital signs were stable and that its mother had been arrested. They identified her only as 24-year-old Ms Luo. In China, people who abandon their children can face up to five years in jail, according to the New Straits Times."
2017-08-13,"Learner drivers across England, Wales and Scotland will soon be able to have lessons on motorways. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170813215507/http://news.sky.com/story/learner-drivers-will-be-allowed-to-have-lessons-on-motorways-from-2018-10986458,"From 2018, a learner will be able to practice on motorways as long as they are with an approved driving instructor in a dual control car. The law change is set to come into affect next year. Currently, drivers with provisional licences cannot go onto Britain's fastest roads. Although there are advanced driving courses, which provide instructor-led motorway for drivers who have passed their test, the cost of these can be off-putting. For the vast majority of new drivers, their first time on a motorway and driving at the upper speed limit of 70 miles-per-hour happens without a teacher in the passenger seat. The Department for Transport, which consulted driving groups ahead of the change in law and received ""wide support"", believes it will make roads safer. ""Younger drivers are up to seven times more likely to be killed or seriously injured compared with drivers over 25 and lack of experience is an important factor,"" said Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. ""Allowing learners to drive on motorways in a supportive environment will help them develop a practical understanding of how to use motorways safely before driving independently."" Learner driver Ellie Mason-Bush, 22, from Bristol is due to take her test next week. She told Sky News she believes the law change is positive news for learners who feel nervous about motorway driving but who could not afford advanced driving lessons. ""I think it is definitely going to help,"" she said. ""They say motorways are some of the safest roads you can be on, so it is not going to harm. Naturally it will slow the process down but, if it makes the roads safer, it is something we all have to get on board with."" The RAC motoring body and the DVSA, the government agency which sets the driving test, have both welcomed the law change. But some driving instructors have concerns about how safe it is. Over a 10-year career, James, who did not give his full name, has taught hundreds of learner drivers. Although it will not be compulsory for instructors to take their pupils on a motorway, James thinks the law change adds unnecessary risk. ""If we take learners to the motorway, there is a danger they might find they panic,"" he said. ""They may go too slow, they may get intimidated. And if they do have a moment of panic, there is no way no pull over."" For now, there are no plans to include motorway driving as part of the basic driving test - but the Department for Transport told Sky News that this is under review. Earlier this year it was revealed that learners would be tested on how to safely use satellite navigation systems, as the Government moves ahead with plans to modernise the standard driving test."

At least eight people were hurt. Among the three dead were two police officers who were the pilot and passenger on a helicopter that crashed near the scene. The other death was a 32-year-old woman who had been crossing the street when she was struck by a car that hit a group of anti-Nazi campaigners also leaving 26 people injured. The male driver has been arrested. The rally by far-right activists was organised to protest against Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee from the city. Speaking about the disorder, US President Donald Trump said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" what he called an ""egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides"". He added: ""What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives."" Some criticised Mr Trump for his seeming reluctance to specifically blame the white supremacists. Republican senator Cory Gardner said: ""We must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism."" Democratic senator Adam Schiff said: ""(The President) needs to speak out against the poisonous resurgence of white supremacy - there are not 'many sides' here, just right and wrong."" Charlottesville mayor Michael Signer had said he was disgusted the white nationalists had come to his town and blamed the US leader for inflaming racial prejudices during his presidential campaign last year. Mr Signer said: ""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in America today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president."" This is the Virginia statute on unlawful assembly #cvilleaug12 pic.twitter.com/dyqdEN7k71 The fighting prompted Charlottesville city manager Maurice Jones and interim county executive Doug Walker to simultaneously declare local states of emergency for the two jurisdictions. Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe declared an emergency as police struggled to manage the two groups. Up to 6,000 white nationalists had been expected to attend the ""Unite the Right"" rally. TV pictures showed one of the fights erupting when the anti-Nazi protesters approached the white supremacists with what looked like a wooden banner. As they did so, they were met by a wall of men dressed in body armour and helmets. Other footage showed rivals on either side using hand-made shields as they fought each other. Police said some people in the crowd used pepper spray. Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville Initially it appeared as though police were not getting involved but the the Virginia State Police have since posted pictures of heavily armed officers carrying out arrests. The violence prompted First Lady Melania Trump to call for an end to the clashes, tweeting: ""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville"" The clashes came after a federal judge ordered Charlottesville authorities to allow a weekend rally of white nationalists and other extremists to take place. The rally was organised by right-wing blogger Jason Kessler, who said that he was saddened people had been hurt and that the driver of the car ""did the wrong thing"". The Southern Poverty Law Center had said it was expecting a range of far-right groups to attend, including the National Socialist Movement, the League of the South, as well as ""various anti-government, Patriot, militia, Klan, III Percenters and anti-immigration groups""."

His younger rivals might not have to nap quite so much, but can they claim to have been at the very first festival 70 years ago? ""I have Glasgow connections,"" Parsons told Sky News. ""I spent five years on Clydebank trying to be an engineer to please my family but I didn't want to. ""All I ever wanted to be was an actor. ""There were about three or four shows I think on the fringe then, 1947, was it? ""Anyway, I was at the very first Edinburgh Festival watching shows up here."" Seven decades later and Parsons has become one of the most popular sightings at the festival. Aside from having to contend with the cobbles using a walking stick, he has no end of fans who stop him to say hello. He'll pose for photos, but selfies which ""make you look awful"" are a no-no. There is a great deal of affection for the veteran entertainer. Tickets to his 'Happy Hour' sold out almost straight away. He describes it as ""a combination of stand-up, ad-libbing with the audience, and also having guests"". As long as the public still find him funny, he said he'll keep coming back. ""I'm in a profession that retires you,"" he said. ""Once I can no longer do it, don't make the audience laugh, can't get on the stage, I'll be retired, but as long as you can do it they'll employ you."" So what's Parsons' secret to staying young? ""Keep moving, keep using your brain. ""If you use your brain, that helps to keep you younger...You've got to laugh at yourself as well."" Parsons started out as a serious actor before moving into cabaret and stand-up in the 50s. It wasn't long before his skills as a comedy straight man were spotted and, by the 60s, he'd moved into television working with comedian Arthur Haynes. Throughout the 70s he hosted the long-running TV quiz Sale Of The Century and December will mark his 50th year hosting the BBC Radio 4 game show Just A Minute. Despite being a household name, Parsons likes to joke about how he isn't always recognised now that he's getting on a bit. ""In the cabaret bar here, the queue stretches out into the Pleasance Courtyard... we have to go in and get it set up and I was standing (near the front) and a man said 'pal, hey pal! This is a queue you know? Get to the back like everyone else!'. ""Then his girlfriend said 'shhh that's Nicholas Parsons...'. ""He said 'I don't give a s**t who it is - he can still queue up like everyone else!'"" The Edinburgh Festival and Fringe continues until 28 August."
2017-08-13,Stargazers were given a treat on Saturday night and in the early hours of Sunday as the Perseid meteor shower dazzled the sky.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170813215507/http://news.sky.com/story/massive-perseid-meteor-shower-thrills-stargazers-10986599,"Meteors are small fragments of interplanetary debris and dust that enter the Earth's atmosphere at such a high speed that they usually burn up, producing the shooting stream of light. The Perseid meteor shower, one of the best-known of the meteor showers, is active from mid July until 24 August but its peak was expected to be this weekend, particularly Saturday night and in the pre-dawn hours of Sunday. One of those who stayed up was Twitter user John-GM7PBB who lives on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland. He told Sky News that he had set his camera up at about 11pm on Saturday and was rewarded with two beautiful images of a meteor above the horizon. His window of opportunity was short, however, as just a few hours later he said the stars had been ""clouded out"". Twitter astronomer @VirtualAstro said that reports of meteor viewings had come thick and fast as soon as the clouds had cleared after dark. He told Sky News: ""This is very rare as there is usually a build up, but the shower started with a bang. ""You could feel the excitement build as many people from across the UK started to see bright meteors and fireballs early on in the evening."" Even in London, which usually loses out due to high levels of light pollution, there was still a good number of meteors to be seen. VirtualAstro said that, within a few hours of darkness, thousands of people from across the British Isles were watching the meteor shower, with many seeing ""several incredibly bright meteors per hour, along with tens of smaller fainter meteors"". ""Usually in the UK we are either clouded out or suffer the ill effects of the Moon on meteor showers, and they usually end in disappointment,"" he said. ""The Perseids in 2017 have been the opposite: performing as soon as it got dark and giving many their first glimpse of a meteor with ease. ""People were so pleased and excited, the mentions in my Twitter feed became unreadable due to the sheer volume of tweets coming in from very happy stargazers."" Robin Scagell, vice president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: ""The Perseids can be very bright and often quite spectacular. ""Some meteor showers are slow, but we are moving into the Perseid stream so they are coming at us quite swiftly. ""You could see none at all for a few minutes and then two or three. ""You might be lucky or unlucky; that's the way with meteors."" If you missed out on the meteor-spotting fun, there is still a chance over the next few nights, or there is the next noteworthy meteor shower in December - the Geminid Meteor Shower. In the US, the meteor shower is being seen as an opening act for the first solar eclipse to cross that country in 99 years, which is expected on 21 August."
2017-08-13,Former foreign secretary David Miliband has used an attack on the ministers spearheading Brexit to call for a second EU referendum.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170813215507/http://news.sky.com/story/david-miliband-says-brexit-unparalleled-act-of-self-harm-10986985,"The Labour ex-frontbencher said ""abdicating"" all approval for a final exit deal to politicians like Boris Johnson and Liam Fox was ""delusional"". Instead a fresh poll would let voters decide whether to accept or reject the Government's plan, he wrote in The Observer. Mr Miliband said he respected last year's referendum result, but also maintained ""democracy did not end on 23 June 2016"". ""The referendum will be no excuse if the country is driven off a cliff,"" he declared. Mr Miliband also described Brexit as an ""unparalleled act of economic self-harm"". It comes as Remain-supporting Tory MP Anna Soubry suggested she could quit the party over Theresa May's approach to Brexit. ""Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?"" she wrote in the Mail on Sunday. ""The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. ""But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party."" Ms Soubry's defection would chip away at the Conservatives' already slim majority. But in a show of strength after a summer dominated by cabinet splits, Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Development Secretary Liam Fox announced there will be a transitional period when Britain finally leaves the UK. They wrote in The Sunday Telegraph: ""We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. ""That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time. ""That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU."""
2017-08-13,"Officially they are known rather grandly as Covert Human Intelligence Sources, but to the rest of us they are snouts, grasses or coppers' narks.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170813215507/http://news.sky.com/story/police-informants-where-should-line-be-drawn-10980924,"Especially to those who remember The Sweeney, the hard-hitting 1970s TV drama about the Flying Squad that often shone a light on the murky world of police informants. People give police information for a variety of reasons - for money, to remove a rival, or to get a cut in their own sentence. If an informant helps the conviction of others, police can give the judge a ""text"" - a letter - outlining the cooperation in expectation of a reduced sentence for their snout. It's become big business for the police, though it's a subject they are reluctant to discuss in detail. A recent Freedom of Information request revealed that UK forces spent £20m in five years on payments to informants. Most informants have some criminal past and one drugs squad detective I knew viewed anyone he arrested as a potential snout. Former Flying Squad detective Peter Kirkham told me: ""In broad terms you set a thief to catch a thief, but it's usually more complicated than that. If you want to know about criminality you need to get information from someone involved in that criminality."" When Mr Kirkham began his detective career 30 years ago there were few checks on how officers used informants. A detective kept the source secret and recorded no details of their meetings or payments. It was an unregulated system that was open to abuse, from both sides. The Scotland Yard investigation into the notorious 1987 axe murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan was condemned years later when it was revealed that a detective had ""coached"" his informant. In the 1990s the Yard was found to be using Jamaican Yardie gangsters as informants without realising they were carrying on their life of crime at the same time. The Yardie case led to stringent oversight of the informant system, with new rules and a code of practice. The latest Home Office guidelines set out strict procedures to be followed, especially on the use of juvenile informants. Yes, police are allowed to use children as their narks, with certain caveats. The Home Office guidelines say: ""On no occasion should the use or conduct of a CHIS under 16 years of age be authorised to give information against their parents or any person who has parental responsibility for them."" Is there a line to be to be drawn anywhere over the use of informants? Can anyone, whatever their past, be hired by police to help them convict other criminals? :: Child rapist paid £10k to spy on underage 'sex parties' An informant in the Newcastle child sex case, a convicted child rapist, claimed during a pre-trial hearing that Northumbria Police had paid him £10,000 for information about the sexual exploitation of young girls. He said part of his work included going to parties where police suspected girls would be intoxicated and sexually abused. Peter Kirkham said: ""I can't see any circumstances where somebody with his previous convictions would be approved as a participating informant to go to places where that sort of thing was happening. ""If the police had reasonable grounds to suspect what was going on they could not have allowed that to happen. ""It's not like me letting a villain steal a car for an armed robbery. In a case like that I would let the theft go ahead because it would lead me to a robbery where I could intervene and arrest more serious villains."" The Newcastle case is the biggest child sex investigation since the Rotherham and Rochdale grooming scandals and involved the trial of 25 suspects. Former North West chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who led the Rochdale prosecution in 2012, said: ""Putting a child sex offender in contact with children and other sex offenders is a line I would not cross. ""It is an ethical issue, but there is also the question of the danger to the children from someone who has already been convicted. My experience shows such men continue to offend. ""You need to be very wary. I can't think of anything that could be done to manage the very obvious risks."""

2017-08-17,Plans in Charlottesville to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee sparked violent clashes between white supremacists and anti-racism demonstrators over the weekend. But why?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170817023336/http://news.sky.com/story/why-is-charlottesville-statue-of-robert-e-lee-so-controversial-10991207,"Born in 1807, Lee was a commander in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. The monuments in his memory - as well as the many schools named after him - have become so controversial because many today view him as a symbol of racism and America's slave-holding history. Lee distinguished himself in various battles during the US-Mexico War that began in 1846. When tensions heated around southern secession, he was offered a post to lead the anti-slavery Union forces against the pro-slavery South. But Lee declined - and he resigned from the US army because he had reservations about fighting against his home state of Virginia. Even though he had little experience leading troops, he accepted a role commanding the Virginia state forces of the Confederacy - 11 states that wanted to establish a new nation where the institution of slavery would be protected. Political scientists say he had a ""mixed record"" of military endeavours throughout the civil war, and he was famously defeated at Gettysburg by Union Major General George Meade. Just a few weeks after he became the general in chief of the armies of the Confederate states in 1865, Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S Grant. Lee had inherited a few slaves from his mother and married into one of the wealthiest slave-holding families in Virginia. Documents show he was cruel to his slaves and encouraged his overseers to severely beat any who were captured after trying to escape. After the civil war ended, Lee resisted efforts to build Confederate monuments in his honour as he wanted the nation to move on from the conflict. But following his death in 1870, a revisionist narrative called ""The Lost Cause"" placed Lee as its central figure - and argued the war had not been about slavery but high constitutional ideals. As The Lost Cause grew in popularity, proponents pushed to memorialise Lee - and monuments went up in the 1920s just as the Ku Klux Klan experienced a resurgence, and laws mandating segregation were adopted. The Robert E Lee statue in Charlottesville was erected in 1924. Earlier this year, the city's council had voted to remove it from a park. Opponents of the move included white supremacists and neo-Nazis who revered Lee and the Confederacy. On Saturday, rallies were held to defend the Lee statue - but the violence resulted in at least three deaths, including that of a female counter-protester."
2017-08-17,News that the UK will seek to maintain its existing customs union arrangements with the EU for a transitional period after Brexit will be welcomed by big business.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170817023336/http://news.sky.com/story/post-brexit-trade-plans-would-be-far-from-straightforward-10989681,"The priority for those companies exporting and importing goods from the EU has been to avoid a ""cliff edge"" effect. They want to be sure that, after Brexit, they may continue with a trade in goods that is, in the jargon, as ""frictionless"" as possible and avoids, for instance, a build-up of trucks at channel ports while safety checks are carried out and customs paperwork completed. Accordingly, there has been a broad welcome from the likes of the British Chambers of Commerce and Federation of Small Businesses to the announcement, as well as trade bodies such as the British Retail Consortium and the ADS, which represents the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors. However, getting to even this position is going to be far from straightforward, given that such a deal will need the blessing of the European Commission. It, as its chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier was quick to note on Tuesday, wants to concentrate on securing the post-Brexit rights of EU citizens in Britain, achieving a financial settlement with Britain and resolving the Irish border issue before going on to discuss customs and trading arrangements. Moreover, for some businesses, the UK Government's own proposals are likely to entail more bureaucracy and not less. Central to the longer-term arrangement, following the transition period, would be measures to prevent goods that do not comply with EU regulations from being imported into the UK for onward sale to the EU. That could entail a lot of hassle for importers and exporters as they have to prove that goods they are exporting are not, if they do not comply with EU rules, ultimately destined for the EU. It looks a form-filler and box-ticker's charter. As one wag put it, the proposals would simply replace red tape with red, white and blue tape. Those exporters who supported Brexit, meanwhile, are likely to find little in these proposals to like. They supported Brexit because they wanted to swiftly strike free trade deals with the likes of the US, Canada, India and Australia. A transitional arrangement along the lines proposed would put the completion of such deals way into the 2020s. Lastly, the bigger question is what happens with services, which account for 80% of UK GDP. In some ways, this is less pressing, as the single market has yet to be completed in many services. But some key export earners, especially the financial services industries, are anxious that the Government sets out its thinking for their sectors quickly."

Technically, it remains a civilian rather than a military ship until it is commissioned later this year. It is also an aircraft carrier which does not yet have fixed-wing aircraft on board. F-35B Lightning II jets are still being built and tested in the US, and the ship won't be fully operational until 2020. :: Navy's new flagship is a true feat of engineering Theresa May, speaking on board, hailed the ship as a symbol of the UK as a ""great global maritime nation"". The PM said: ""Britain can be proud of this ship and what it represents. ""It sends a clear signal that as Britain forges a new, positive, confident role on the world stage in the years ahead we are determined to remain a fully engaged global power, working closely with our friends and allies around theworld."" ""Whether the task be high intensity war-fighting, targeted action to fight terrorism, or humanitarian relief to save lives overseas, these ships will transform the UK's ability to project power around the world,"" she added. Those on board and watching from the shore were treated to two separate flypasts of Royal Navy helicopters, the first featuring a Sea King, two Mk2 Merlins and two Mk3 Merlins, which were then joined by two Hawk jets for the second. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: ""She is Britain's statement to the world: a demonstration of British military power and our commitment to a bigger global role. ""The thousands of people across the UK who have played a part in building her and her sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, should be immensely proud as our future flagship enters Portsmouth."" The behemoth aircraft carrier sailed into the Solent before heading into Portsmouth, where, at its narrowest point, there was less than 20m (66ft) clearance on each side. The band of the Royal Marines played as the ship slowly navigated into the harbour, which has had to be dredged to make room. HMS Queen Elizabeth manoeuvred towards a new extended and reinforced jetty under her own power before tugs nudged her gently into position. An 820ft (250m) exclusion zone, enforced by armed police in small boats, meant the port was effectively closed to the flotilla of boats that had turned out to greet the ship. Lt Cdr Neil Twigg, a fast jet pilot responsible for integrating the F-35 fighter jet into the carrier group, said: ""We are very ready, there is still a lot more work to be done, the aircraft is still going through its testing programme in America and the ship has still some more sea trials but we are on the right track."" Some members of the public, as well as politicians, have expressed concern over the £3bn price tag for the aircraft carrier. But Admiral Chris Parry, a former senior Royal Navy officer, told Sky News that HMS Queen Elizabeth offers ""real military power"" to deter rogue states - as well as terrorist groups such as Islamic State."
2017-08-17,"My first introduction to the awe-inspiring power of the Royal Navy's carrier force came aged just 10 years old, on a visit to see HMS Ark Royal R09 in Edinburgh.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170817023336/http://news.sky.com/story/hms-queen-elizabeth-navys-new-flagship-a-true-feat-of-engineering-10990510,"It was the very last of Britain's more traditional carriers, those that use catapults to launch fixed-wing aircraft and arrester wires to catch them on landing - the model still adopted today by the US and France. For a young lad, spending the day on board a 40,000-ton naval vessel was mind-blowing. I've been fascinated by aircraft carriers ever since. Four decades on came a chance to rekindle some of that boyhood excitement - and do a little journalism as well. As HMS Queen Elizabeth steamed into the English Channel ahead of her first visit to her home port of Portsmouth, I boarded a Royal Navy Merlin helicopter to join the ship. It is truly hard to appreciate the enormous scale of Britain's new aircraft carrier, until you are face-to-face with her. At more than 65,000 tons and almost 300 metres long, she is a true Leviathan. Our helicopter, one of two, landed on the ship's four-and-a-half acre flight deck. There is room for many more. In times of high crisis, Queen Elizabeth can accommodate more than 50 aircraft, a mix of fast jets and helicopters. Critics who complain the Queen Elizabeth is a giant carrier with no aircraft are badly informed. The fact is the Royal Navy's biggest ever warship is still on sea trials. It will be another three months at least before her builders hand her over and she is commissioned into the Royal Navy. There were about 1,000 people on board the carrier for her trip into her home port, a mix of the ship's company, air crew and their support and a couple of hundred contractors. There was a real palpable sense of excitement among those embarked for this major milestone in the UK's return to carrier air power. Captain Jerry Kyd told me the military are not usually emotional people, but some on board have been working on this project for the last four or five years. This was the culmination of a massive feat of engineering which has seen parts of the carrier constructed at yards across the UK and assembled at Rosyth, in Fife. For Captain Kyd, the carrier's entry into Portsmouth had even more emotional resonance. He was in command of the Invincible class Ark Royal carrier when it made its final homecoming to Portsmouth seven years ago. At more than three times the size of HMS Ark Royal, Queen Elizabeth had a much tighter fit to enter Portsmouth. It was a manoeuvre not for the faint-hearted, but the crew here had full confidence in their vastly experienced captain. With a wry smile, Captain Kyd tells us that when Henry VIII first chose Portsmouth for his Navy, they were sailing ships the size of the Mary Rose. No wonder the Navy has spent months dredging millions of cubic meters of mud from the seabed at the entrance to the port. This modern-day symbol of Britain's maritime power, named after Henry VIII's daughter, entered the port ever so slowly - a journey she will make many times in her 50 years of service for the Royal Navy."

Mrs May told reporters on Wednesday: ""I see no equivalence between those who profound fascists views and those who oppose them. ""I think it is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far-right views wherever we hear them."" It comes after the PM originally failed to directly challenge remarks the President made on Saturday about the violence. On Monday her spokesman said: ""What the President says is a matter for him. ""We are very clear. We condemn racism, hatred and violence. We condemn the far right."" But before Mrs May issued her second statement, some senior Tories had begun to criticise the US leader directly. Communities minister Sajid Javid became the first UK Cabinet minister to directly challenge Mr Trump, writing in a post on Twitter: ""Neo-Nazis: bad. Anti-Nazis: good. I learned that as a child. It was pretty obvious."" Justice minister Sam Gyimah also said ""silence matters"" and told people ""we must call out hate - unambiguously"". The leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson wrote: ""The President of the United States has just turned his face to the world to defend Nazis, fascists and racists. For shame."" A Tory MP, Robert Jenrick, also promoted a tweet from US senator John McCain that read: ""There's no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate& bigotry. The President of the United States should say so."" Labour MPs have also used the controversy to call for Mr Trump's state visit to the UK to be cancelled. Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith tweeted: ""A state visit by #DonaldTrump would shame this country and betray all we stand for. Theresa May should revoke the invitation immediately."" Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood said Mr Trump's comments were ""sickening"" and a ""new low"". ""When will UK Govt admit he should never had been invited for a state visit?"" she asked. Mrs May has previously faced criticism for refusing to directly condemn the US President. In January, she dodged three questions on Trump's immigration ban, eventually saying: ""The United States is responsible for United States policy on refugees. The UK is responsible for UK policy on refugees."""

The shop closes at 10pm every night, after which it only opens its doors to let customers out. According to the East Kilbride News, the boys hid in the clothing department until closing time before ""ransacking"" it. A source who spoke to the paper said the lads had worked their way through ""hundreds of pounds"" worth of goods before being discovered. They were not found until 2am the following day, at which point the incident was reported to the police. A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed they were investigating an alleged theft, and said: ""An investigation is ongoing and we are continuing with our inquiries."" Officers confirmed that a £35 camera and two memory cards were found to be missing after a stock take following the incident. A spokeswoman for Sainsbury's said: ""We can confirm there was an incident at our East Kilbride store and we're supporting the police with their investigation."" She also said that no alcohol was consumed or stolen during the boy's lock-in. New night-time security measures - including closing the shop shutters and extra security checks - are reportedly being introduced in the branch following the incident."

As many as 7.4 million people are expected to travel to areas where the Moon will completely block out the Sun, and excitement ahead of the event has led to shortages of solar eclipse glasses in some US cities. An other-worldly experience awaits those able to take in the total eclipse, NASA research scientist and astronomer Michelle Thaller told Sky News. :: What to expect during Great American Eclipse She said: ""This is something that changes your life. Nothing prepares you for the emotional response of seeing a sky that doesn't look like the sky from this world. ""The thing that really gets me is you will see the Sun set 360 degrees around you. Your instincts go a little crazy as this is not the sky you are used to seeing. ""It is so beautiful… the first time I saw a total eclipse of the Sun it was like looking up into the sky of a different world. It is an emotional experience."" Dr Thaller described solar corona - streams of light that will surround the Sun during the eclipse - as ""wonderful"". She said: ""That is the outer atmosphere of the Sun, gasses about a million degrees hot. That is rather strange as the surface of the Sun is closer to 10,000 degrees. ""One of the big mysteries in science is why the outer atmosphere of the Sun is that hot and this is something we will be studying with our aircraft during the eclipse. ""It is safe to look at the solar corona. You'll see the planets Mercury and Venus lining up next to the Sun and some of the brighter stars."" :: Sky News will have full live coverage of the Great American Eclipse on Monday 21st August"

I can't sit down and listen when people explain things to me - I like to learn on the job. After GCSEs, I studied A-levels at college and I really didn't know what to do after. But then a friend told me about apprenticeships and sent me a web link to a few different schemes. I applied for three apprenticeships and IBM called me. After a couple of interviews, I got the job. My decision not to go to university was not money-based because my dad had always said he would help me, or I could get a student loan. I didn't know what to expect when I began the scheme, but I was treated like a full-time employee as soon as I joined and I've been given so much responsibility. I feel like the apprenticeship scheme gave me a clear path and it's a plus that I get to learn and earn. I'm really happy - I get to work with the coolest technology and travel the world for my work. I think the scheme was the right route for me because I already have a professional network of people who see what I can do and I get to talk to people at the forefront of technology. Everyone here at IBM is on a level playing field, and whether we did an apprenticeship or a degree, we all have different skills to offer. Lots of my friends went to university, but I really don't feel like I missed out on anything - a bunch of us apprentices enjoy going out together. Now I'm two years in, I'm pleased that I did an apprenticeship - I even have a flatmate who wishes he had done it. Serenna Mackenzie, 23, Cloud Division Seller, IBM When I was choosing what to do after college, I was put off going to university by the huge fees (my year was the first to cost £9,000 per year) and I wasn't sure what I would study. However, there weren't many apprenticeship schemes available and most entry-level jobs were asking for a degree as a minimum requirement. So I took the advice of my teachers, friends and family and chose something which I enjoyed. I enrolled at Aston University on a four-year Business and Management degree. I gained a great foundation across a range of disciplines including economics, law, marketing and operations, which have all helped now I am working in a business environment. Yet, going to university gave me more than just an education - it provided me with a whole experience. I loved the independence and the excitement of living in central Birmingham and I met some great people. My third year was a placement, which I did with IBM in Hursley, near Winchester. It was a fantastic experience and I was surprised by how much responsibility I was given. I would recommend to anyone to take up a placement year if their course allows - it acts as a differentiator in a competitive graduate market. I re-applied to IBM to join their graduate scheme and I'm now a Software Seller in IBM's Cloud business, looking after local government and healthcare customers in London."

The 52-year-old from Peshtigo, Wisconsin, said he could only see an inch of the 3.5in nail sticking out of his chest and ""common sense"" told him not to pull it out. ""I could see the nail moving with my heartbeat,"" he said. ""It was kind of twitching with every heartbeat. ""I was frustrated because I knew I wasn't going to get home until late and I couldn't get anything done."" After driving to a hospital 10 minutes away, Mr Bergeson started to feel more pain and needed the help of a security guard to make it inside. X-rays showed the nail was a 16th of an inch - about the thickness of a piece of paper - from a majority artery. Mr Bergeson was rushed to a cardiovascular hospital by ambulance and underwent open-heart surgery. ""A wrong heartbeat, a wrong position, and he would have had a much more complicated problem than he was bargaining for,"" Dr Alexander Roitstein said. ""He's quite fortunate from that standpoint."" Dr Roitstein added that Mr Bergeson's decision to leave the nail in place ""shows the great composure this gentleman had after a very bad day's experience"". Mr Bergeson spent just two days in hospital and has been recovering at home since the accident on 25 June. He said: ""I feel pretty good. I'm back to doing things carefully.

The EU has provided billions of euros of aid for the province since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement ended decades of violence, known as the Troubles, between Irish nationalists and British unionists in which 3,600 people died. ""We ... want the EU funding that has helped victims of the Troubles and cross-community groups to continue at least until the current programme finishes,"" Mrs May wrote. The Government had earlier committed to guaranteeing funding under the EU's Peace initiative until the current round of funding ends in 2020. The PM also sought to reassure nationalists living in Northern Ireland that Brexit will not see the UK turn its back on its ""unique and special relationship"" with Ireland. She promised that rights enshrined under the Good Friday peace accord, such as the right to claim Irish citizenship, would be safeguarded after the exit from the EU in March 2019. For her article, she chose the Belfast-based Irish News, a daily paper aligned with mainstream nationalism. ""No one voted to end the special ties between the UK and Ireland or to undermine the unique arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland which have underpinned the peace process and have been in place well before our membership of the EU,"" the PM said. ""I hope people in Northern Ireland and Ireland will see the UK Government is determined to protect the unique arrangements between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and the wider relationship between the UK and Ireland. ""Protecting your citizenship rights, and protecting the Belfast Agreement, are at the heart of our approach,"" she said."

However, the South is set to bask in sunshine, with temperatures forecast to reach up to 27C on Monday as the low pressure system draws warm air up from Europe. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: 'Hurricane Gert is currently a category 2 hurricane. ""It'll be heading towards the UK over the next few days, but not as a hurricane. ""Tomorrow (Friday) it will downgrade to a tropical storm, but as it tracks across the Atlantic it will interact with another low pressure system to the east of Canada, and the two lows will move to the UK by the end of the week. ""There will be a lot of rain likely and although the forecast could change slightly, it currently looks like the rain will be across northern areas on Sunday and into Monday, with heavy and persistent outbreaks across the North West."" The National Hurricane Centre said on Tuesday that Gert, the Atlantic's second hurricane of the season, would be generating winds of up to 80mph before becoming calmer as it moves over colder water on Thursday. A tropical depression in the Atlantic formed the storm on Sunday, but it did not make landfall."

The position paper also said that the Government is committed to maintaining the border-free Common Travel Area covering the UK and the Republic of Ireland. That means free movement across the border for British, Irish and EU citizens. The British government said it wanted a seamless and frictionless frontier without ""physical border infrastructure and border posts"". ""We don't want to see a border between parts of the United Kingdom,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said. ""What we want to see is an arrangement in relation to customs and borders with the European Union which will enable us to see no return to the hard borders of the past in Northern Ireland, to enable that flow of goods and people between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""That's not just in the interests of Northern Ireland and the UK, it's in the interests of the Republic of Ireland and the European Union too. "" The paper confounded speculation that the UK would advocate CCTV cameras or number plate recognition systems as part of its vision for a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It rejected the idea of an effective customs border in the Irish Sea as ""not constitutionally or economically viable"". Instead, it recommended wide-ranging tariff exemptions for small- and medium-sized businesses trading over the border and suggested that larger companies could report imports and exports online. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney welcomed the proposals, though he said more clarity was needed. Democratic Unionist Party leader and former Stormont first minister Arlene Foster - whose party supports Mrs May's minority Government in Westminster - described the paper as a ""constructive step"". ""It is clear the Government has listened to voices in Belfast, Dublin, Brussels and London about how the United Kingdom's only EU land border could be managed after we exit the EU,"" she said. But Sinn Fein called it ""delusional"". Critics fear that the absence of a hard border with the Irish Republic - an EU member which accepts the free movement of people from the bloc - would effectively offer a ""back door"" into the UK for immigrants after Brexit. At the moment, some 30,000 people cross the 500km border every day without customs or immigration checks. But the Government said it is ""confident"" it can still enforce new immigration controls through checks on things such as the jobs market and welfare system. The paper also says the Government wants the Good Friday Agreement - which sealed peace in a region where around 3,600 people had been killed in violence known as the Troubles - to be written into EU withdrawal agreement. And Mrs May also moved to reassure nationalists in Northern Ireland, also saying that some of the EU funding of the peace process could be replaced by UK funding. ""We will absolutely work for all sides in Northern Ireland, we're absolutely committed to the Belfast agreement and ensuring the decisions we take are decision for every community in Northern Ireland,"" said Mrs May. The document is the second in a series of position papers being released by the Government ahead of a new round of Brexit talks with Brussels next week. On Tuesday, it published plans for a temporary customs union with the EU, drawing a cold response from Brussels, with one official branding the proposal ""fantasy"". However, on Wednesday, the European Commission called the papers a ""positive step"", adding: ""Clock is ticking & this will allow us to make progress"". It also said: ""On Ireland, we must discuss how to maintain Common Travel Area&protect Good Friday Agreement before looking at technical solutions."" The CBI said the Government was going ""in the right direction"", but said there's ""a way to go before businesses are reassured that trade will continue smoothly after Brexit"". On the island, some shellfish farmers selling oysters in Europe have said post-Brexit customs and Irish border ideas are ""utterly deluded"" and could wipe out their businesses. Darren Cunningham, who runs Killowen Shellfish on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, said: ""Light touch? I just can't see that working. ""It just can't be done unless they go and look in the back of every lorry, the way it was in the past."""

Video footage shot around 10.40am shows the gang outside Boodles on Basil Street in Knightsbridge, with smoke pouring from the front door as the helmet wearing suspects make their exit. Three men can be seen manoeuvring three mopeds as they wait outside the shop, before three more suspects run outside onto the pavement. The last suspect to leave the shop is carrying a large sledge hammer - which he casually rests on one shoulder as he gets onto the bike - and what appears to be a bag full of loot. The six suspects - who are all dressed in black - then jump onto the mopeds - two on each bike - honking their horns as they make their getaway. A police spokesman said: ""A number of suspects had arrived on motor scooters, entered the store and then used hammers to smash their way through counter displays. ""The robbers removed property from the displays and then made off on the bikes."" A spokeswoman for Boodles confirmed that no one was hurt, and that police were now investigating. A security device was also activated inside the shop during the raid - which appears to have created the plumes of smoke which can be seen in the footage. The value of jewellery stolen has not been revealed, and no arrests have been made. The family-run British jewellers has been running for over 200 years, and in 2014 appeared in a Channel 4 documentary showcasing their most expensive collection of jewellery at the time - an emerald necklace worth £1m. Moped-enabled crime has reached almost epidemic proportions in the capital over the last year, with police logging more than 16,000 moped-related crimes in the past 12 months - a threefold increase on the previous year."

Prime Minister Theresa May had also weighed in, saying: ""Of course we want to ensure people's safety at work but it can't be right for Big Ben to be silent for four years."" She had urged Commons Speaker John Bercow to ""urgently"" review the plans. Officials have now confirmed that the matter will be reviewed when MPs return from their summer break. A spokesman said: ""When Parliament returns, in light of concerns expressed by a number of MPs, the House of Commons Commission will consider the length of time that the bells will fall silent. ""Of course, any discussion will focus on undertaking the work efficiently, protecting the health and safety of those involved, and seeking to ensure resumption of normal service as soon as is practicable given those requirements."" Brexit Secretary David Davis was among those who had dismissed health and safety concerns linked to the clock tower's restoration - telling the estate's authorities to ""just get on with it"". The four-year silence, which is due to begin on Monday at noon, would be the longest period that Big Ben has fallen quiet in its 157-year history. The 13.7-ton Great Bell was last stopped for maintenance in 2007, and before that was halted for two years in 1983 for refurbishment. Parliamentary officials maintain that workers' hearing would be put at ""serious risk"" if the 118-decibel bongs continued, and warned those using the 100m (328ft) high scaffolding could also be startled by the noise. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told LBC that silencing the bell was ""not a national disaster or catastrophe"" - and said it would be worth it so renovators can work in safe conditions. The £29m renovation includes the installation of a lift and repairs to the clock's hands, mechanism and pendulum."

Issued from Kennebunkport, Maine, where they have a family home, the statement said: ""America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms."" :: Protest victim's mother: We must fight hatred They also made reference to Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, whose main home Monticello is in Charlottesville. ""As we pray for Charlottesville, we are reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city's most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights. ""We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country."" The joint statement did not mention Mr Trump by name. :: Jesse Jackson: 'There are no Hitler statues in Germany' Mr Trump's remarks on the violence have triggered a backlash across the political spectrum - including several members of his own party. Five chief executives from some of America's biggest companies resigned from the President's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative Panel, before Mr Trump disbanded it on Wednesday. :: May criticises Trump's protest response ""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..."" pic.twitter.com/InZ58zkoAm The parade of departing leaders includes 3M chief executive Inge Thulin; Alliance for American Manufacturing president Scott Paul; Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier; Under Armour chief executive Kevin Plank and Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich. After Mr Paul's resignation, Mr Trump tweeted: ""For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!"" :: Unvarnished Trump fuels Charlottesville flames Following his decision to disband the council, he tweeted: ""Rather than putting pressure on the business people of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!"" Senior members of the Republican party have also waded in with criticism. South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday that the President ""took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally"" and the people protesting against them. He added: ""Many Republicans do not agree with and will fight back against the idea that the Party of Lincoln has a welcome mat out for the David Dukes of the world."" :: Why is Charlottesville statue so controversial? Former Democrat president Barack Obama quoted Nelson Mandela in a tweet about the Charlottesville violence that has become the most liked message in the history of Twitter. In it, he wrote: ""No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his background or his religion."""
2017-08-17,A sinkhole that opened up in the driveway of a West Midlands home on Sunday is now 10 ft wide and growing. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170817023336/http://news.sky.com/story/sinkhole-continues-to-grow-after-consuming-front-wall-and-driveway-10991503,"After consuming garden slabs, parts of the front wall and a portion of the driveway, the 12 ft deep chasm is now threatening to swallow a car. The owner of the house has evacuated on the advice of the council, but it is still unclear what caused the hole to suddenly open up in an apparently ordinary street. Neighbour Glenys Murphy said coal mines below the surface have left the area ""like a honeycomb"". She said sinkholes had regularly opened up in around the Wednesbury area, and that another had swallowed a tree in the same street a few decades before. Ms Murphy said she was not concerned for the safety of her own home, as it had been built on a coal dump. Disused mines, salt deposits and the collapse of caves are common causes of minor sinkholes in the UK, according to the British Geological Survey. In Februrary 2014 experts blamed ""wet weather"" when three sinkholes opened up in the UK in unrelated incidents in less than two weeks. One teenager was left ""absolutely gutted"" when her Volkswagen Lupo disappeared into a gaping cavity in the earth's surface, while residents of Hemel Hempstead reported feeling the ground shake as a 30-ft hole appeared below a house. Professor Amir Allani, professor of civil engineering at Greenwich University, said underground flooding may have ""created the erosion"" that ""in time, has facilitated the layers above the weak strata to collapse."" The West Midlands hole that appeared this week has become an attraction for other residents, who reportedly have been travelling by car to photograph the expanding crevice. The Coal Authority has been informed of the hole's existence and is reportedly investigating. Meanwhile, the void may continue to grow. ""It's going to take some filling,"" Ms Murphy said."

Parents made 232 claims against maternity units after newborns suffered cerebral palsy or brain damage in 2016/17 - a 23% rise from the 188 reported a year earlier. The NHS Resolution's annual report said the total value of these claims was close to £2bn. It added that the cost of paying for the ""complex life-long care needs"" often seen in such cases could soon exceed £20m per child. According to NHS Resolution, the cost and charges associated with compensating affected families ""will continue to increase for years, probably decades to come"" - and these rises are going to be ""unavoidable without significant law reform"". Helen Vernon, chief executive of NHS Resolution, said in the report: ""These incidents can have a devastating impact on those involved and we must do everything we can to learn from what happened. ""Like all parts of the NHS, we need to make sure that every penny we spend is value for money for the taxpayer. ""This means making some difficult decisions on delivering compensation only where it is due and ensuring that the NHS is not overcharged for legal costs."" On Saturday, it emerged that the Royal College of Midwives had dropped its campaign encouraging women to give birth naturally. The campaign, which had been running since 2005, promoted birth without medical intervention such as an emergency caesarean. Professor Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the college, denied the campaign had compromised safety but said she did not want women to feel they had ""failed"" if they had not had a normal birth. The campaign drew criticism after an inquiry into the deaths of 11 babies and one mother at the Morecambe Bay trust between 2004 and 2013. The inquiry found the desire for natural deliveries at any cost among midwives had contributed to unsafe births. Peter Walsh, chief executive of the Action Against Medical Accidents charity, told The Daily Telegraph that the 23% increase in claims against maternity units of newborns was alarming. He told the newspaper: ""More research needs to be done to understand what is leading the increase, but moving away from the cult-like fixation with so-called 'normal birth' is a step in the right direction."""

The MP for Rotherham's piece was headlined: ""British Pakistani men ARE raping and exploiting white girls... and it's time we faced up to it."" Her remarks came just days after 18 people were convicted or admitted offences in a series of court hearings related to child sexual exploitation in Newcastle. Ms Champion wrote: ""Britain has a problem with British-Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls. ""There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is? ""For too long we have ignored the race of these abusers and, worse, tried to cover it up. ""No more.

Ms Chapman said: ""I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in The Sun article on Friday. ""I am concerned that my continued position in the shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection, which I have campaigned on my entire political career. ""It is therefore with regret that I tender my resignation as shadow secretary of state for women and equalities."" After the column was published, Ms Champion sought to distance herself from the article, saying it had been altered. But a spokeswoman for The Sun said: ""Sarah Champion's column, as it appeared on Friday, was approved by her team, and her adviser twice contacted us thereafter to say she was 'thrilled' with the piece and it 'looked great'. ""Indeed, her only objection after the article appeared was her belief that her picture byline looked unflattering. Her office submitted five new pictures for further use."""

The number of EU students planning to study at a UK university or college has also fallen by 5%. The dip is being attributed to a drop in the number of 18-19 year olds in the country and changes to popular bursary schemes. However, other statistics point to a wider issue. The Sutton Trust recently released figures suggesting that the proportion of young people who think they are likely to go into Higher Education when they are old enough has fallen to the lowest level since 2009. It comes as another option for sixth form or college leavers has seen a large uptick in interest - apprenticeships. The number of starters on apprenticeship schemes has risen steadily from 175,000 in 2005-06 to more than 500,000 in 2015-16. A total of 2.4m new apprenticeships started between 2010-11 and 2014-15 and the Government appears on target to reach its goal of 3m new schemes by 2020. Holly Hollingworth is one A-level student waiting for her results but already accepted on to an apprenticeship. ""I've always had a part-time job and that just sort of suited me more rather than going to college 24/7, five days a week,"" she told Sky News. ""Where I can get the same qualification and work without the debt, it just seemed silly not to use that option."" Universities and employers agree that it is not about one area winning and the other losing, as both paths offer different life choices. However, one university boss admits the market has become far more competitive. ""Universities are responding to that in the way they market and brand themselves,"" Royal Holloway University chief operating officer David Ashton said. ""They are trying to improve the quality of their physical estates by making major investments in facilities."""

He said: ""There are no Hitler statues in Germany today or neo-Nazi material flying around. ""These guys sought to secede from our union, maintain slavery and secession and segregation and sedition, and so these statues are coming down and they should come down. ""When you lose the war you vanquish your symbols. Their symbols should exist in a museum someplace."" Mr Jackson spoke about the violent clashes during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville on Saturday, in which one person was killed. The initial rally was triggered by the proposed removal of a statue to Confederate General Robert E Lee, whom Mr Jackson described as a ""traitor to our country"". He also criticised President Donald Trump, who has claimed ""many sides"" were involved in the violence. ""To equate those who vow a race war, who vow to maintain the legacy of bigotry and the race supremacy, with the civil rights protest is not a fair equation. ""Such an equation has emboldened the white supremacists, has emboldened the neo-Nazis; he (Trump) sees them as his base. ""But the fact is, as President of the United States, we're all his base, the military is his base, all tax-paying Americans are his base. He sees us through a keyhole and not through a door. ""We are all under one big tent, but he sees us as a few in and many out and it's not working."" :: Protest victim's mother: We must fight hatred Confederate monuments were removed from Baltimore, Los Angeles and New York earlier this week following the outcry over the Virginia violence.

The secession began the American Civil War which ran until 1865, when all the Confederate forces surrendered."

It already has 13 such centres in the UK, and is on track to open further new warehouses in Doncaster, Warrington and Tilbury later this year. Amazon said the decision to open another centre just outside of Bristol at Severn Beach was driven by ""increasing customer demand"". The announcement comes less than a month after the firm said it was doubling the number of research and development (R&D) specialists it is looking to recruit in London. The company is aiming to hire 900 R&D workers for its UK headquarters in Shoreditch, including software development engineers, user-interface experts, data analysts and graphic designers. The announcement was seen as a boost for the UK amid fears the country will be starved of access to talent from the continent after Brexit - with employers highlighting worries about a skills shortage. Filton and Bradley Stoke MP Jack Lopresti, whose constituency includes Severn Beach, said: ""This will bring more jobs to our area and offer careers with training opportunities, helping the local economy to grow. ""An international outward-looking company like Amazon will help us maximise the fantastic opportunities for our region after Brexit."" Amazon, which has faced criticism over the way it treats workers, said all permanent ""fulfilment centre"" staff would be offered ""competitive wages and comprehensive benefits starting on day one"". Employees will start on an hourly wage of £7.65, increasing to £8.15 or more over their first two years on the job, it said. It will also offer staff stock grants and benefits including private medical insurance, income protection, subsidised meals, and a company pension plan. Stefano Perego, Amazon's director of UK customer fulfilment, said: ""There are several factors we consider when deciding on where to place a new fulfilment centre, and Bristol offers fantastic infrastructure and talented local people who we look forward to joining the Amazon team."""
2017-08-17,"The UK's jobless rate hit its lowest level since 1975 - but average earnings continued to lag behind inflation in the three months to June, official figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170817023336/http://news.sky.com/story/wages-continue-to-lag-behind-inflation-10990853,"Wages grew by 2.1% compared with the same period last year, the Office for National Statistics said. This is a slight increase on the previous March to May quarter, when the ONS revised down its preliminary figure to 1.9%. However, once inflation is taken into account, total pay in real terms sank by 0.5% both including and excluding bonuses. It comes a day after official data showed inflation remained unchanged in July at 2.6%. Economists had expected it to climb to 2.7%. The figures are significant as they show a continuation in the squeeze on living costs, largely thanks to the collapse in the pound following the Brexit vote, which makes imported goods more expensive. Inflation remained static because increased food, clothing and electricity costs were offset by a drop in fuel prices. As pay growth picked up pace, employment reached an all-time high, the ONS said. The number of people in work is at its highest level since records began in 1971, rising by 125,000 to 32.07 million in the three months to June, with the employment rate climbing by 0.3% to a record 75.1%. Unemployment fell by 57,000 to 1.48 million during the same period - a 42-year low - while the claimant count dropped by 4,200 in July to 807,800, figures showed. Analysts said the dats was unlikely to persuade the Bank of England to finally put up interest rates. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""Worryingly for consumers, higher employment is still not translating into higher pay. ""Anaemic earnings growth is a key factor arguing against any near-term Bank of England interest rate hike."" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ""The weak rate of wage increases is baffling economists and central bankers alike. ""Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, has frequently cited accelerating wage growth as a possible trigger for the long-awaited increase in UK base rates but today's figures are hardly likely to persuade the Monetary Policy Committee that the UK economy is overheating and in need of higher borrowing costs."" Employment Minister Damian Hinds told Sky News: ""We are doing many things to help families with the cost of living, and ultimately of course, what helps to drive forward wage growth is productivity and that's why you see so much focus on developing the skills base, the apprenticeship programme. ""We are bringing more people out of tax altogether ... a big investment going into childcare, including the doubling of the provision for three to four-year-olds - all of these things are very important for supporting household budgets."""
2017-08-17,Two specific developments leap out of today’s jobs data.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170817023336/http://news.sky.com/story/employment-and-wage-data-shows-uk-economy-is-out-of-balance-10991377,"Firstly, that employment in the UK economy is at an all-time high of just over 32 million and that the jobless rate has fallen to a better than expected 4.4%, the lowest since 1975. Secondly, despite that good news, average earnings are growing at a nominal rate of just 2.1%, compared with the headline inflation rate of 2.6%, equating to a real-terms fall of 0.5%. These two developments should not, according to classic economics, be compatible. In theory, in a tight labour market, wages should be pushed higher. The relationship between low unemployment and higher inflation was first highlighted by William Phillips, a professor at the London School of Economics, in 1958. The Phillips Curve, in which he proved the relationship, is still taught today even though it has been disputed since by other economists. There are various reasons why the relationship may have broken down. The most obvious is that job insecurity remains very high. This has been the case since the financial crisis, with many workers concluding it was in their interest to forego pay rises, or not push for them, if it meant they were more likely to keep their job. Another explanation is that the workforce has become more fragmented and trade union membership has fallen. Workers are less able than they once were to band together and bargain on a collective basis for higher wages, particularly when self-employment is rising. Further explanations include the introduction of the national living wage. It is possible that some employers, having had to award pay increases to their lowest-paid workers, have decided against giving pay rises to their other employees. In a similar vein, it is possible that some employers, faced by mounting pension deficits, are having to shovel money into retirement schemes, at the expense of pay rises for employees. An additional factor is that productivity has fallen. Without improvements in productivity, employers cannot afford to pay their workers more. Another theory, put forward by the economics team at Deutsche Bank, is that the Phillips Curve is actually ""alive and kicking"" when wages are adjusted for productivity. They argue: ""Dreadful post-crisis productivity, and large labour market slack up to the 2013 recovery, largely explain disappointing pay growth."" They agree that more recent weakness in wages growth is due to pay restraint ""in the face of Brexit uncertainty"". The good news is that, buried in today's figures, there are signs that job security is starting to improve. For example, while there were still 883,000 people on so-called 'zero hours' contracts during the April to June quarter, that was 20,000 fewer than in the same period last year. Another cause for optimism is that more jobs being created are full-time. All of the increase in employment during the last year has been in full-time work - with the number of people working part-time having fallen. The rate of self-employment is also slowing. In the same period last year, self-employment was growing at a rate of 6%, but this year it was just 1%. Meanwhile, although the figures were slightly down on the previous quarter, there were 768,000 job vacancies in the three months to July. Businesses are still creating jobs and looking for workers. So there are plenty of causes for optimism. Ministers will be hoping desperately that, before long, the classic relationship between low unemployment and wage inflation reasserts itself. Few things would do more to engender more cheeriness in a country that feels, this summer, pretty grumpy."

Paramount Pictures, the producers of Mission Impossible 6, confirmed filming would be postponed while Cruise recovers. The film studio said in a statement: ""During production on the latest 'Mission: Impossible' film, Tom Cruise broke his ankle while performing a stunt. ""Production will go on hiatus while Tom makes a full recovery. ""Tom wants to thank you all for your concern and support and can't wait to share the film with everyone next summer."" Reports in the US suggested filming could be stopped from anywhere between six weeks and three months. But director Christopher McQuarrie insisted it would not delay the film's planned release date of 27 July next year, despite there being seven or eight weeks of filming left to complete. In an interview with Empire magazine, McQuarrie described Cruise as being in ""very good spirits"". Revealing Cruise was ""always supposed to slam into the side of the building"" during the stunt, the filmmaker added: ""On the fourth try, he hit the building at a slightly different angle and he broke his ankle.

The Trust chose the latter, and has now shortlisted six possible designs. Project curator Sophie Chessum said she hopes the work will bring this once magnificent family home back to life. She told Sky News: ""We've reached a really exciting stage. ""It has been great working with the architects and they have put a huge amount of effort into their concepts so we now have six teams with six concept designs and we are really looking to them to bring some creativity back to Clandon.

But the 8th Earl of Onslow, Rupert Onslow, whose family owned Clandon Park until 1956, is hugely disappointed by the plans. Since the fire he argued that a part modern, part restoration build would not do his family's former home justice, and that he would rather it was left as a ruin or for the £30m budget be spent on a project elsewhere. ""Clandon is dead,"" he said. ""It is a tragedy - it was a magnificent, extraordinary place that a lot of people claimed as being one of the great houses of Britain.

The Pensions Regulator, which carried out an investigation into the episode, said Mr Chappell had failed to comply with three notices requiring information, issued in April and May last year and in February this year. It said Mr Chappell had been summonsed to appear at Brighton Magistrates' Court on 20 September to face three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents.

2017-08-23,Bradley Walsh has been rumoured to play Doctor Who's new sidekick in the first female-led version of the show.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170823030344/http://news.sky.com/story/bradley-walsh-rumoured-to-play-doctor-who-sidekick-11000158,"According to reports in the Mirror, the 57-year-old actor and comedian will star alongside Jodie Whittaker, who was recently unveiled as the first female Time Lord. Although reports have not been confirmed by the BBC, Walsh or Whittaker, fans have already expressed their excitement online. Actor Matt Lucas, who was a sidekick to Peter Capaldi's Doctor, wrote on Twitter: ""No idea if the story about Bradley Walsh being in Doctor Who is true, but if it is then I love it. #TeamBradley."" ""Bradley Walsh as a companion in Doctor Who is so ridiculously out of the box it might just work,"" wrote another user. Walsh, who presents The Chase quiz show on ITV, previously starred in Coronation Street and recently enjoyed success with a singing career. No idea if the story about Bradley Walsh being in #DoctorWho is true, but if it is then I love it. #TeamBradley ""Bradley is super excited to be joining the cast of Doctor Who in such a key role,"" a source was quoted by the Mirror as saying. ""It means that his schedule over the coming months will be jam-packed,"" the source added. ""But, crucially, it won't affect his role as presenter of The Chase. He loves that show with a passion and so does the audience, so he's delighted to have found a way to make it all work."" The report has yet to be confirmed by any of the parties involved."
2017-08-23,"The Liberal Democrats will continue to support the legalisation of cannabis, party leader Sir Vince Cable has confirmed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170823030344/http://news.sky.com/story/sir-vince-cable-confirms-lib-dems-still-back-legalising-cannabis-11000508,"He said it was better to control the drugs industry rather than have what he called ""free market anarchy"", continuing the party's long-term commitment to legalisation. The party said during the General Election campaign - under previous leader Tim Farron - that the drug would be taxed and sold on the high street, with the estimated £1bn of tax generated going into education and investment. The Home Office has said it has no plans to legalise cannabis because there is ""clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health"". However, Sir Vince said there were ""serious negative side effects from driving it underground"". He told the BBC's Newsbeat: ""The evidence is clear that if you want to stop abuse and damage to young people, you've got to bring the trade into the open and out of the hands of the criminal underworld. ""Common sense suggests to me that you should try to regulate and control this market, rather than just have a free market anarchy in the underground, which is what happens at the moment."" The Home Office said its independent experts - the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, said using the drug is a significant public health issue and can ""unquestionably"" can cause harm. Legalisation would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, it added, saying such a move would send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs."

She was first approached by a man wearing a novelty shark hat as she boarded the train, who offered to help her with her luggage. Once on the train, at around 8.45pm, he sat next to her and asked if she wanted a kiss. When she said no, he tickled her before trying to take her mobile phone. The second attack took place when the girl moved seats to get away. A second man approached her at around 9pm and when she told him what had happened, he kissed her and touched both her and himself inappropriately. A spokesman for British Transport Police called the incident ""deeply upsetting and shocking"" and asked anyone who may have witnessed the attacks to make contact. The first man is described as white with pale skin and ginger hair. He was wearing a white shirt with a palm tree on it, blue shorts and a novelty shark hat. The second man is also white, with mousy hair and pronounced sideburns. He was wearing a white polo shirt and camouflage shorts and told the girl his name was Lance.

Roser Venura said officers told them to immediately leave the plantation and added: ""We heard a helicopter flying around and many police cars coming toward the gas station"". El Pais claimed Abouyaaquob shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" before he was shot. Sky News Correspondent Mark White, who is at the scene, said: ""Police are taking no chances at the moment. They have cordoned off the area. They are telling local people to stay indoors and stay away. ""There is some suggestion that he may have been with at least one other person. There is an alert around this area. ""More armed police are being brought in and they are beginning to search local shops around the villages here to ensure there are no other suspects.""

It comes amid evidence of falling new car sales, with industry data showing new registrations down 9% in July compared to the same month last year and 2% lower for the year to date. Ford's sales volumes were nearly 24% lower last month and 4% down for the January-July period, according to the recent figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Under the new scheme, incentives are available on a variety of Ford models, with customers typically getting £2,000 off cars priced up to £20,000. Rival car maker Vauxhall ran a similar scheme earlier this year. The Government last month announced proposals to introduce a ""targeted scrappage scheme"" as part of its court-mandated plans for meeting legal European Union limits on harmful nitrogen dioxide pollution. It would be focused on drivers who need most support, such as those on lower incomes or living next to a clean air zone. Ministers also plan to ban the sale of all conventional diesel and petrol cars by 2040. Ford of Britain chairman and managing director Andy Barratt said: ""Removing generations of the most polluting vehicles will have the most immediate positive effect on air quality, and this Ford scrappage scheme aims to do just that."" Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said it was a ""shrewd commercial move by a company that has invested heavily in petrol and diesel technology""."

He was serving a life sentence for killing and dismembering police officer Gordon Semple, who he had met up with for sex. Brizzi, who was HIV positive, had been put on a programme for prisoners considered at risk, a pre-inquest review hearing at Southwark Crown Court was told. But the crystal meth addict was taken off on 28 December and on 4 January ""suicide watch ceased"", senior coroner Dr Andrew Harris said. A letter ""indicating he was thinking about death"" had been found in his cell, the hearing was told. Dr Harris gave the cause of death as hanging, adding there were no injuries ""implying altercation with another party"". A noose was said to have been discovered in the cell on 6 December - when Brizzi was still on suicide watch. It was unclear if the letter was found on 10 December or was dated on 10 December and found later, the court heard. Dr Harris questioned the potential ""non-disclosure"" of the letter to staff and said it had been suggested Brizzi made the noose out of boredom. A full inquest will open on 23 April next year and will include a jury. The coroner said: ""Given the nature of his crime we need to understand... whether he was assessed as a violent prisoner. ""It may relate to the fact he was in a single cell and whether he had been exposed to risk by other prisoners."" Brizzi strangled police officer Gordon Semple, 59, while high during a sex session, dismembered his body and tried to cook and eat parts of it. The former IT developer met his victim on Grindr and arranged to meet him at his flat near the Tate Modern gallery in London on 1 April last year. A fan of Breaking Bad, he admitted being inspired by the TV series as he tried to get away with killing the officer by dissolving his flesh in an acid bath. He was arrested after neighbours complained of a foul stench coming from his flat. :: If you feel suicidal or vulnerable, click here to contact the Samaritans or call 08457 90 90 90."

NHS officials are understood to have studied existing health insurance schemes where customers are rewarded with 25% off their weekly shop, according to The Daily Telegraph. The proposals are aimed at countering the public's sedentary lifestyle while reducing pressure on the over-stretched health service. There are also plans for free bikes to be given away with new build houses and flats, in a bid to cut car use and encourage cycling. Linking public health to urban design, NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said, ""If there's to be a much-needed wave of new house building across England, let's 'design-in' health from the start. ""The NHS makes no apologies for weighing in with good ideas on how the how the built environment can encourage healthy towns and supportive neighbourhoods.""

The accident, which also left five sailors injured, was the second deadly collision in two months involving an American warship and the US Navy has launched a fleet-wide investigation. Commander of the US Pacific fleet Admiral Scott Swift has confirmed the search operation had led to the recovery of some remains and it would continue until all hope had been exhausted. Efforts by the ship's crew following the collision were able to halt flooding into other parts of the vessel, which is now docked at Singapore's Changi Naval Base for damage assessment. Admiral Swift said: ""The divers were able to locate some remains in those sealed compartments during their search today."" ""Additionally, the Malaysian authorities have reported that they have located potential remains. They are working to confirm and identify those remains."" US Vice President Mike Pence said to have sailors killed in two collisions this year was ""unacceptable"" and vowed to ""get to the bottom of it"". Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship collided in waters off Japan.

2017-08-23,Scotland Yard is to ask for more money to continue its six-year investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170823030344/http://news.sky.com/story/hunt-for-madeleine-mccann-needs-more-cash-to-continue-10999676,"Detectives are struggling to resolve a final lead, which, if it fizzled out, could have brought the £11m Government-funded investigation to an end next month. I understand that the Home Office is willing to carry on paying for the last bit of work to be completed. A source said: ""We will be asking for more money because we need to complete the work we are doing. It is complicated and not as straightforward as we had hoped, but it is worth doing."" Madeleine was nearly four years old when she vanished without trace from her family's rented holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May 2007. The Portuguese police closed their investigation 15 months later, after finding nothing to explain her disappearance. In 2011, after an appeal from her parents Kate and Gerry McCann, the then Prime Minister David Cameron asked Scotland Yard to investigate with special Home Office funding. Sixteen months ago then Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said his squad - reduced in 2015 from 30 to three staff - was expecting to close a final investigative lead within months. ""That line of inquiry probably at the moment is the conclusion of this inquiry,"" he said. In April this year, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said detectives were still following a critical lead. ""We have a significant line of inquiry which is worth pursuing and because it's worth pursuing it could provide an answer - but until we've gone through it I won't know whether we are going to get there or not."" Police will give no details of the lead - nor why it is proving so difficult to resolve. But they want more time to pursue it. There has been speculation that it involves a hunt for a suspect or a key witness, but none of that has been confirmed. Retired Metropolitan Police detective Peter Kirkham said: ""Media interest and the political drive for it to be done in the first place will add to a reluctance to stop the investigation until they are absolutely sure they have done everything they can. ""If a line of inquiry has any signs of life in it whatsoever, they will be saying 'this is here and we can do it but we'll need this amount to do it and if you don't wish to pay for it that is your decision'."" A spokesman for Madeleine's family told Sky News: ""The McCanns will be pleased. The fact that the police feel there is still work to be done which needs funding is very encouraging. ""They remain grateful to all the officers involved in the investigation."" Scotland Yard said: ""Funding is in place until the end of September. Any details about future funding will be released when appropriate."" The Home Office confirmed that funding for Operation Grange had been provided until the end of next month. ""The level of funding provided is a reflection of the wide-ranging and complex nature of the investigation which the police have deemed necessary to undertake,"" a spokesperson said. They added that they have not received a new funding request from Scotland Yard but that ""any future request will be considered carefully""."
2017-08-23,"Growing uncertainty about an 'open skies' deal between the UK and European Union countries ahead of Brexit risks triggering a catastrophic slump in British air travel, according to the country's biggest airports.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170823030344/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-air-traffic-faces-slump-without-brexit-deal-airports-warn-11000318,"Sky News has obtained a confidential report submitted to Government by Gatwick, Heathrow, London City, Manchester and Stansted airports, which urges the EU and the UK Government to target October next year as the deadline for an interim aviation arrangement. The report, written by consultancy WPI Economics, is understood to have been sent to ministers in recent weeks. Its emergence highlights the importance attached to an early aviation agreement between the UK and EU - an industry priority given added urgency by the fact that the sector is not subject to a World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework and therefore faces seeing flights grounded without a new temporary or permanent deal. The document's most pessimistic scenario forecasts that between March 2018 and March 2019, there could be a 41% fall in passenger demand across Britain's biggest airports - equating to 8.1m bookings, or 16.2m journeys, between the UK and EU countries It also highlights the risk of a 20.6% decline in aircraft movements - or 297,000 flights - and a 3.8%, or 8,600-ton, fall in freight traffic. :: EasyJet's new airline is clever but expensive response to Brexit :: US airlines warn that no EU deal on flights could mean planes are grounded While WPI does not attempt to quantify the potential revenue impact of such falls, a source at one of the operators said it was likely to be hundreds of millions of pounds across the five airports. That would translate into much bigger sums in the regional economies surrounding the airports. The report, titled 'Brexit and the aviation industry: the opportunity for certainty', is thought to be the first time that the owners of Britain's four largest airports, as well as the smaller London City, have joined forces to warn of the risks of uncertainty about post-Brexit arrangements. ""With airlines, passengers and airports having to plan months if not years in advance, this has potentially detrimental consequences for UK competitiveness, trade, growth and living standards, which all become more significant the longer that UK and EU negotiators fail to deliver a new trading relationship or transitional deal,"" the WPI report says. ""This is an important point. ""Although an 11th-hour deal may prevent planes from being grounded, damage to the aviation industry and the wider economy would have already been done."" WPI stresses that an early agreement with the EU is necessary because the closer the industry gets to the end of the Article 50 withdrawal process without a deal, ""the greater the negative economic consequences will be"". ""Any slowdown in aviation traffic will undoubtedly have detrimental consequences for UK competitiveness, trade, employment, growth and living standards and airport infrastructure and foreign direct investment,"" said one airport industry source who has seen the report. Heathrow's involvement in jointly sponsoring the document is intriguing because of its consistent argument that it needs to build a third runway because of soaring demand for flights from the UK's only hub airport. The airports' collective alarm bell follows a string of similar warnings by airlines in the 14 months since the EU referendum. Last month, Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, met Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary, to reinforce an earlier statement that airlines would be ""cancelling people's holidays"" in the summer of 2019 without a new UK-EU aviation deal. A source close to Mr Grayling said preliminary informal talks with his EU counterparts had been ""positive"". Mr Grayling has also met with US officials and airlines to discuss the potential renegotiation of aviation deals with 'third countries' that will be affected by Brexit. A Government spokesman said: ""Aviation is absolutely crucial to the UK's economy and we are committed to getting the right deal for Britain. ""Our aviation industry is the largest in Europe, and both we and the EU benefit from the connectivity it provides. ""That's why we are pursuing liberal access to European aviation markets - including all the benefits that brings for consumers."""

Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, who is due to speak at the summit in Leeds, said the gathering shows ""the patience of people in the north of England has run out"". He added: ""We are getting organised and demanding the Government keeps all of its promises to people here and delivers a fair funding deal for the north of England. ""We are not against our capital city developing world-class infrastructure but it cannot be at the expense of the north. ""People here have put up with clapped-out trains and congested roads for long enough."" The issue was put back on the agenda on Tuesday, when former chancellor George Osborne said a ""Northern Powerhouse"" rail network connecting Liverpool to Hull, a so-called High Speed 3, should be planned for by the Government as it progresses with HS2. Writing in the Financial Times, he said: ""Far be it from me to offer advice to the Prime Minister on how to relaunch her premiership this autumn, but making this big commitment to the North at the Conservative conference in Manchester would not be a bad place to start."" A petition set up by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) North think tank, calling for the Government to fund Crossrail for the North, has been signed by more than 70,000 people. Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake, who will also attend the summit, said: ""Transforming rail connections across the North was part of the original plan to create a Northern Powerhouse and was estimated to bring £100bn in economic growth as well as 850,000 new jobs. ""The people of the North are demanding a direct commitment from Government to increase investment in transport and to settle for any less would hold back the potential of the north for decades to come."" The leaders of Sheffield, Newcastle and Manchester Councils, Liverpool city region metro mayor Steve Rotheram and representatives from a range of business groups will be among the others attending the conference. Responding to the criticism, transport minister Paul Maynard said funding had been provided for the development of detailed proposals for transport upgrades which the Government put money into. He said: ""I keep hearing demands for investment in the north but I should point out they come from some of the very same people who we have asked to help develop plans. ""We all want to improve rail in the north and we are all getting on with the work that needs to be done."""

She had just given birth by C-section and was on her way to a maternity ward to recover and spend time with her newborn on Sunday, according to a report by El Correro. Her baby escaped unhurt, the newspaper said. She had two other girls, aged four and five-years-old, according to local media, which reported the 25-year-old had been decapitated in the horrific tragedy. It is thought the lift began moving upwards before the stretcher was fully in, following a suspected mechanical failure. The victim's brother-in-law, David Gaspar, told Europa Press the family were ""devastated"" by her death. Her husband, Jose Gaspar, told ABC Sevilla: ""I'm a total wreck."" ""This cannot continue. Today it has been Rocio, but tomorrow it could be another person."" Carmen Nunez said her heart started pounding with worry for her daughter when she learned there had been an accident involving a lift at the hospital. ""I went to the information desk. They told me that a girl had died, and then they confirmed that she was my daughter. What a cruel death she suffered,"" she told Diario de Sevilla. Health minister Marina Alvarez said the ""tragic accident"" was being investigated, El Pais reported. She said the lift had undergone checks on 12 August and complied with the regulations. Hospital chiefs have met with officials from the firm responsible for the lift and its maintenance, and support is being provided to the family of Ms Nunez, the newspaper said. Police, firefighters and medics rushed to the scene, but the mother-of-three could not be saved."
2017-08-23,Two specific developments leap out of today’s jobs data.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170823030344/http://news.sky.com/story/employment-and-wage-data-shows-uk-economy-is-out-of-balance-10991377,"Firstly, that employment in the UK economy is at an all-time high of just over 32 million and that the jobless rate has fallen to a better than expected 4.4%, the lowest since 1975. Secondly, despite that good news, average earnings are growing at a nominal rate of just 2.1%, compared with the headline inflation rate of 2.6%, equating to a real-terms fall of 0.5%. These two developments should not, according to classic economics, be compatible. In theory, in a tight labour market, wages should be pushed higher. The relationship between low unemployment and higher inflation was first highlighted by William Phillips, a professor at the London School of Economics, in 1958. The Phillips Curve, in which he proved the relationship, is still taught today even though it has been disputed since by other economists. There are various reasons why the relationship may have broken down. The most obvious is that job insecurity remains very high. This has been the case since the financial crisis, with many workers concluding it was in their interest to forego pay rises, or not push for them, if it meant they were more likely to keep their job. Another explanation is that the workforce has become more fragmented and trade union membership has fallen. Workers are less able than they once were to band together and bargain on a collective basis for higher wages, particularly when self-employment is rising. Further explanations include the introduction of the national living wage. It is possible that some employers, having had to award pay increases to their lowest-paid workers, have decided against giving pay rises to their other employees. In a similar vein, it is possible that some employers, faced by mounting pension deficits, are having to shovel money into retirement schemes, at the expense of pay rises for employees. An additional factor is that productivity has fallen. Without improvements in productivity, employers cannot afford to pay their workers more. Another theory, put forward by the economics team at Deutsche Bank, is that the Phillips Curve is actually ""alive and kicking"" when wages are adjusted for productivity. They argue: ""Dreadful post-crisis productivity, and large labour market slack up to the 2013 recovery, largely explain disappointing pay growth."" They agree that more recent weakness in wages growth is due to pay restraint ""in the face of Brexit uncertainty"". The good news is that, buried in today's figures, there are signs that job security is starting to improve. For example, while there were still 883,000 people on so-called 'zero hours' contracts during the April to June quarter, that was 20,000 fewer than in the same period last year. Another cause for optimism is that more jobs being created are full-time. All of the increase in employment during the last year has been in full-time work - with the number of people working part-time having fallen. The rate of self-employment is also slowing. In the same period last year, self-employment was growing at a rate of 6%, but this year it was just 1%. Meanwhile, although the figures were slightly down on the previous quarter, there were 768,000 job vacancies in the three months to July. Businesses are still creating jobs and looking for workers. So there are plenty of causes for optimism. Ministers will be hoping desperately that, before long, the classic relationship between low unemployment and wage inflation reasserts itself.

Rahul Rao, visiting researcher at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Ann Roche, director of the National Centre for Training and Addiction at Flinders University in Australia, have published their research in The British Medical Journal. They were particularly concerned about women whose drinking is prompted by retirement, bereavement, change in home situation or social isolation. ""Alcohol misuse in the older population may increase further as baby boomers get older because of their more liberal views towards, and higher use of, alcohol,"" the researchers wrote. ""A lack of sound alcohol screening to detect risky drinking may result in a greater need for treatment, longer duration of treatment, heavier use of ambulance services, and higher rates of hospital admission."" Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said that, while much had been made of a decline in youth drinking, not enough attention had been paid to the growing problem among older people. He said: ""The over 50s have seen a time when alcohol has become increasingly affordable and have been bombarded with sophisticated alcohol marketing messages telling them they can't live a fulfilling life unless alcohol is at the centre of it. ""What they haven't been told is that alcohol is linked to over 200 types of illness and injury, including seven types of cancer. ""If we are to turn the tide of alcohol harm we need measures which tackle the affordability, availability and promotion of alcohol, starting with the introduction of a minimum unit price which would reduce rates of death, illness and hospital admission numbers caused by alcohol."" Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: ""This is the first generation in living memory that has had easy access to cheap alcohol in shops and supermarkets and now we are seeing the consequences in later life. ""We need to take stock of this situation and prevent future generations from developing alcohol problems in older age through price increases and stricter controls on alcohol promotions."" Mr Rao and Ms Roche also warned that doctors will need extra skills to cope with a ""rapidly growing problem"" of drug misuse among baby boomers. They said doctors would need ""improved knowledge and skills"" in assessing and treating older people at risk of misusing opiate prescription drugs, cannabis, and, increasingly, gabapentinoid drugs used to treat neuropathic pain and anxiety."

That puts it ahead of upmarket Waitrose, at 5.1%, and comes as a separate report from Nielsen suggested squeezed consumers were cutting back on grocery spending to save money. Waitrose had already fallen behind Lidl's low-cost rival Aldi - which is now the fifth biggest chain. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons still lead the way but the combined share of the ""big four"" has now slipped below 70%, down from more than 76% five years ago. Fraser McKevitt, head of retailer and consumer insight at Kantar, said Lidl was growing sales much faster among families than from households without children. ""Families tend to buy more items each time they shop, so strong growth with this demographic has helped Lidl to increase its average basket size year on year,"" he said. Kantar said ten million households shopped at Lidl during the 12-week period, with alcohol and fresh produce performing particularly well. Overall supermarket sales were up 4% year-on-year though ice cream sales slipped 9% and burgers slumped by 25% thanks to the disappointing summer weather. Meanwhile, shoppers saw a further squeeze from higher prices, with grocery inflation ticking up to 3.3%, compared to 3.2% the month before. Separate data from Nielsen, covering a shorter, four-week period to 12 August, showed supermarket sales growth slowing to 2.5%, compared to 5.1% the month before. Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said: ""The return of inflation and rising concerns about the economy mean the weekly grocery shop is now the most popular target for people to cut down on grocery expenses. ""Thirty percent of Britons now admit to buying cheaper grocery brands to save money."" Here are the top ten UK grocery retailers by market share, as reported by Kantar: Tesco 27.8% Sainsbury's 15.8% Asda 15.3% Morrisons 10.4% Aldi 7% Co-op 6.3% Lidl 5.2% Waitrose 5.1% Iceland 2.1% Ocado 1.4%"

I can't sit down and listen when people explain things to me - I like to learn on the job. After GCSEs, I studied A-levels at college and I really didn't know what to do after. But then a friend told me about apprenticeships and sent me a web link to a few different schemes. I applied for three apprenticeships and IBM called me. After a couple of interviews, I got the job. My decision not to go to university was not money-based because my dad had always said he would help me, or I could get a student loan. I didn't know what to expect when I began the scheme, but I was treated like a full-time employee as soon as I joined and I've been given so much responsibility. I feel like the apprenticeship scheme gave me a clear path and it's a plus that I get to learn and earn. I'm really happy - I get to work with the coolest technology and travel the world for my work. I think the scheme was the right route for me because I already have a professional network of people who see what I can do and I get to talk to people at the forefront of technology. Everyone here at IBM is on a level playing field, and whether we did an apprenticeship or a degree, we all have different skills to offer. Lots of my friends went to university, but I really don't feel like I missed out on anything - a bunch of us apprentices enjoy going out together. Now I'm two years in, I'm pleased that I did an apprenticeship - I even have a flatmate who wishes he had done it. Serenna Mackenzie, 23, Cloud Division Seller, IBM When I was choosing what to do after college, I was put off going to university by the huge fees (my year was the first to cost £9,000 per year) and I wasn't sure what I would study. However, there weren't many apprenticeship schemes available and most entry-level jobs were asking for a degree as a minimum requirement. So I took the advice of my teachers, friends and family and chose something which I enjoyed. I enrolled at Aston University on a four-year business and management degree. I gained a great foundation across a range of disciplines including economics, law, marketing and operations, which have all helped now I am working in a business environment. Yet, going to university gave me more than just an education - it provided me with a whole experience. I loved the independence and the excitement of living in central Birmingham and I met some great people. My third year was a placement, which I did with IBM in Hursley, near Winchester. It was a fantastic experience and I was surprised by how much responsibility I was given. I would recommend to anyone to take up a placement year if their course allows - it acts as a differentiator in a competitive graduate market. I re-applied to IBM to join their graduate scheme and I'm now a Software Seller in IBM's Cloud business, looking after local government and healthcare customers in London."

Their owner, Khrystinea Farnworth, said one female pony had ""had her trust broken again by a human"". Matilda was rescued seven years ago when it was discovered she was being tethered to a tree with barbed wire. The horse recovered and gave birth to a foal, Lucas, but in the early hours of Sunday both had their necks and hind areas slashed with knives. Lucas died in the attack and Miss Farnworth suspects it was because he panicked and had a heart attack. Seven other Shetlands also suffered injuries, while a stallion was thought to have been herded into a different enclosure by the offender. ""It's disgusting and barbaric,"" said Miss Farnworth. ""You don't expect it to happen to you. I still can't process what has actually happened. ""We are in the middle of nowhere and have no enemies."" She dashed to the ponies' rescue after the nearby pub phoned to warn her three of the animals were on the loose. ""Lucas was lying motionless in the field. I have gone running up to him and the first thing I saw was a stab wound to the side of his neck,"" said Miss Farnworth. Matilda, who already had neck scars, is recovering from her injuries. ""She has lost her son. She is an older pony and she is exhausted. She has had her trust broken by a human again,"" said Miss Farnworth. ""She knows she has lost him. She keeps shouting for him, she keeps whinnying. It's upsetting. ""They are all pets. They are our lives. They can't speak, they can't defend themselves, that is why we have so many rescue horses. We give them a voice. ""I don't understand people' s mentality to be able to do that."" Police have warned horse owners in the area to be vigilant."

The paper cites the ""certainty"" families, businesses and individuals need when dealing with legal issues within the EU. Continued judicial co-operation is seen as ""crucial"" for millions of EU citizens living in the UK and British residents on the continent, as well as businesses trading with EU-based companies and ordinary people who get caught up in legal disputes. A UK Government source said: ""With more and more families living across borders, we need to make absolutely sure that if and when problems arise, they can be reassured that cross-border laws will apply to them in a fair and sensible way.""

""xHamster is currently one of the most trafficked websites on the internet,"" Hawkins wrote. ""We have the eyeballs, and the revenue. Unlike Netflix, you wouldn't be competing for part of our production budget - it would be yours,"" he added. ""We know we're an unlikely home, but five years ago people laughed at the idea of Netflix producing original series. We think that our time, like yours, has come."" Sense8 is a Netflix original sci-fi show from the Matrix creators, which focuses on eight multicultural strangers who are mentally and emotionally linked, breaking traditional concepts like gender and sexuality. The Wachowskis themselves were once brothers, but have undergone gender transitions, changing their names from Laurence and Andy to Lana and Lilly. In his letter, Hawkins spoke of the show's LGBTQ inclusivity and how it fits with the business model xHamster adopted. ""xHamster has a long history fighting for the rights of sexual speech, and non-normative sexuality,"" he said. ""In addition to allowing billions of users to connect with individual articulations of gender and sexuality, we continue to use our audience to speak up against repressive anti-LGBTQ laws in the US and abroad, and for sex ed in public schools, Planned Parenthood and the right of sex workers."" Sense8 was cancelled by Netflix in June, and the streaming giant promised a two-hour-long final episode to please fans who rallied against the show's untimely demise. xHamster is one of the biggest adult websites in the world, with more than 10 million subscribers and a reality series produced in-house."

Quantities of class A and B drugs were seized. At one property in North Kensington an ambulance was called over concerns a suspect had swallowed drugs. The raids were part of the Metropolitan Police effort to tackle crime ahead of this weekend's Notting Hill Carnival. To date, officers have made more than 290 arrests for a range of offences recovering 190 knives and 18 firearms. Chief Superintendent Robyn Williams, the force's spokesperson for Notting Hill Carnival, said: ""Our officers have been proactive and focused on tackling serious violence and knife crime across London.

It will be shown on Sky One at 8pm on Tuesday, ahead of the 20th anniversary of her death on the 31 August next week. One poignant recollection comes from the man who was military attaché to the British Embassy in Paris at the time. Brigadier Charles Richie helped with the repatriation of Diana's body back to the UK, and more significantly broke protocol by deciding that the Royal Standard and not the Union Flag should be draped on the coffin. In the programme Brigadier Richie says: ""Her body was in a coffin, there was never a mark on her face, she was beautifully made up, she looked as though she was sleeping. ""The RAF sergeant as I recall said, 'Which flag shall we put on the coffin sir?' And I said, 'What flag have you got?' And he said the Union Flag and the Royal Standard. ""I said, 'Well my head says the Union Jack, my heart says the Royal Standard'. Unless it is a member of the Royal family that is dead the Royal Standard should not be used. ""And I said 'put on the Royal Standard I will take responsibility.'"" The Standard Flag is normally only used for members of the Royal family. From the time of her divorce Diana was no longer known as Her Royal Highness. Speaking about the reaction to his unorthodox choice he adds: ""I was merely told technically I was wrong, but when you saw the reaction of the public… ""An official communication then arrived to the ambassador informing him to thank me for the unconventional decision I had taken, full stop."" Another extract from the documentary features Philip Bartlett, who was only 23 and serving in the Welsh Guards, when he was asked to be one of the pallbearers on the day of Diana's funeral. In the programme he talks movingly about what it meant to carry her coffin and escort the gun carriage through the centre of London on the way to Westminster Abbey. Talking about the first moment they lifted her coffin and the huge responsibility of that day he says: ""It was the first time we actually felt the weight of the coffin, we lifted it up and we thought this is quite heavy this is. ""As we were going past Buckingham Palace we were told that the Queen will be there so we did the eyes right. ""As we carried on up the Mall we knew that just by the gates of St James's that Prince Harry and Prince William, and Prince Charles would join us, and Earl Spencer and Prince Philip. ""You had to keep your head up, had to look proud, your arms down by your side, you can't be fidgeting, but that was very hard to do because each stage of that four-and-a-half mile mark there was cheering, there were people clapping, there were people crying, there were so many different emotions and you were going through that with them."" An American couple who were among the first people to witness the scene of the crash inside the tunnel in Paris share their story, along with journalists who reported on the news that the Princess of Wales has died. Parents and charity workers who met the Princess through her charity work also feature in this latest documentary, reflecting on her unforgettable spirit that people are still drawn to 20 years on.

2017-08-23,"Shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial have collapsed by 75% after it warned of a ""rapid deterioration"" in its consumer credit business and cancelled its dividend.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170823030344/http://news.sky.com/story/doorstep-lender-provident-financial-slumps-60-on-profit-alert-11000062,"Chief executive Peter Crook has stepped down with immediate effect as the group alerted investors to a downgrade of up to £180m in expected annual earnings. It was the latest profit warning from Provident over the impact of a restructuring plan - following an earlier alert in June. The group also said it was facing an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) into a repayment option plan from its Vanquis Bank operation - a product that offers, for a fee, the option for customers to have a break from monthly repayments. Provident said that in view of both developments it was withdrawing a half-year dividend announced only last month and warning shareholders were unlikely to receive a full-year payout. Shares were down by as much as 75%, wiping nearly £2bn off the group's market value. They later recovered slightly but still closed out the day 66% lower. Provident had already said in June that profits from its consumer credit division were likely to fall to around £60m after changes to the way it operates. The restructuring involves using full time staff to deal with customers rather than self-employed agents - but resulted in many leaving and a deterioration in collections and sales. Provident aimed to restore performance to ""acceptable levels"", but progress has been weak and it is ""now falling a long way short of achieving these objectives"". The consumer credit business is now expected to post a loss of between £80m and £120m. Provident said, in the circumstances, Mr Crook had decided to step down with immediate effect. Manjt Wolstenholme, who will take on the role of executive chairman, said: ""My immediate priority is to lead the turnaround of the home credit business."" Provident has 1.6 million customers in the UK, offering credit limits of £250 to £4,000. It provides credit to people who do not meet the loan criteria of mainstream banks. Even before the latest profit warning, it had become the target of short-selling by hedge funds - who were effectively betting against the shares."

Madsen, 46, initially said he had dropped Ms Wall off on an island in Copenhagen late that day but has since told police that she died in an accident and he buried her at sea in an unspecified location in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen. Police said late on Monday that they had found a woman's torso near Koge Bay after an intense search. Copenhagen police chief Jens Moller Jensen told reporters: ""When I say torso, it's a body without head, arms and legs"". He said it was ""too early"" to say if it was Ms Wall. Madsen has already appeared in court on 12 August in relation to Ms Wall's disappearance but the hearing was held behind closed doors and the investigation has been classified. Ms Wall, a graduate of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, was a freelance reporter who had worked for The Guardian and The New York Times. After she failed to return from the interview, the 60ft sub was also reported missing and was later found in Koge Bay. Madsen was found soon afterwards. Police have said they believe he ""deliberately"" sank the vessel but he has denied any wrongdoing. The sub, named Nautilus, was the biggest private sub ever made when Madsen built it in 2008 with help from a group of volunteers."

2017-08-23,"George Osborne has called on the Government to launch a massive programme of rail investment in the North of England, a so-called High Speed Rail 3.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170823030344/http://news.sky.com/story/george-osborne-calls-for-hs3-rail-line-for-northern-england-11000074,"Writing in the Financial Times, the former chancellor proposes the train line would connect the west and east coasts from Liverpool to Hull, intersecting with the northern branch of the HS2 line which is due to begin construction in 2019. The now editor of the London Evening Standard has retained his role as chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, which this week is launching its first campaign calling for the new network. When in government, Mr Osborne launched the Northern Powerhouse initiative, a series of policies designed to boost investment in the North of England and encouraging greater cooperation between its local authorities. The idea was that the cities of the North alone were too small to compete in an era of global ""mega cities"" like London, New York and Tokyo, but together could form a ""powerhouse"" given there is so little distance between them. :: New homes will be bulldozed for HS2 rail line Theresa May's government has been accused of dropping the idea, for many months refusing to talk about it by name. Mr Osborne acknowledges this: ""There was a systematic attempt by Theresa May's advisers (apparently without her knowledge) to eradicate all mention of the initiative. ""Thankfully, the idea has proved more enduring than those advisers. The Northern Powerhouse Partnership has the support of the northern civic leaders and many major businesses. ""This autumn we will find out whether the UK Government is truly committed to the idea of building a Northern Powerhouse. Repeating the slogan is not the same as taking the decisions to make it a reality."" This is politically difficult as the Government has recently cancelled a series of rail electrification programmes across the country and in the North in particular. The Government says changes in train technology means the investment is not needed, but commuter groups and passengers have expressed their anger, especially as it happened at the same time as the Government indicated its support for ""Crossrail 2"", a new north-south underground line for London. The North of England has historically been the poor relation to London and the South East in terms of infrastructure spending. Mr Osborne argues if the Government wishes to show it is truly committed to northern voters it must endorse HS3. But the Rail, Maritime and Transport union has accused Mr Osborne of ""hypocrisy"" over his comments. General secretary Mick Cash said: ""This is a man who was the key player in governments which presided over fragmented, cash-starved and privatised rail across the North and which put profiteering first while passengers were left rammed into clapped-out, lashed-up Pacer trains. ""The real legacy of George Osborne's period in government is axed electrification, modernisation and renewal programmes, and private train companies given a political instruction to axe safety-critical guards from their trains."" In his new guise, Mr Osborne has become known as an excoriating critic of Mrs May's Government, launching a series of stinging editorials in the Standard. Some have accused him of sour grapes and having a vendetta against the Prime Minister, who sacked him. But in the year that she failed to win a majority, partly off the back of her failure to win around northern voters, Mr Osborne's intervention will add to pressure on her to recommit to them - just at a time when his successor Philip Hammond is trying to find money for other projects as preparations are made for his first autumn budget."

Your time is everything and make sure you spend it right it's something you can't get back! #welcometoourworld #whateverittakes #livinthedream #loveitkillit #1dayumay #richpiana #queenofbeautykingofbeast #love #whateverittakes A post shared by Sara Piana 👑 (@sara.ice.queen) on Aug 25, 2017 at 3:36am PDT Piana, a former Mr California, collapsed at his home on 10 August while having a haircut, TMZ reported. He was rushed to hospital and placed in a medically induced coma. His girlfriend, Chanel Jansen, shared an update on 17 August. She wrote: ""The worldwide outpouring to send Rich voicemails and messages to have played or read to him is overwhelming! We can't thank you all enough for your continued support during this time. ""The only update I'm permitted to give at this time is that he is alive, he is okay, and the excellent medical professionals here as well as myself and his close loved ones are doing all we can to get him back to a full recovery."" Piana had more than 1.2 million followers on his Instagram page and posted images of his physique as well as bodybuilding advice on social media. Last year, he admitted using anabolic steroids over long periods to help him gain muscle mass. In a YouTube video in April 2016, he said: ""If you have the choice to stay natural or do steroids, stay natural. There's no reason to do steroids, you're only hurting your body, you're hurting yourself. ""If you want to become a professional bodybuilder, guess what - you're probably going to have to f****** do 'em. You're not going to have a choice."" Bottles of testosterone were found by police at his home, according to TMZ. It was unclear what caused his collapse."

2017-08-26,Helicopters have been airlifting heavy machinery from the towers of Britain's tallest bridge ahead of its opening this week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170827042822/http://news.sky.com/story/queensferry-crossing-to-open-after-10-year-challenge-11008100,"The Queensferry Crossing over the Firth of Forth, north of Edinburgh, is the longest free-standing balanced cantilever bridge in the world. Its towers stretch 210 metres into the sky, making it the tallest bridge in the UK. Traffic will be able to use the crossing this week, ahead of its official opening by the Queen on 4 September. It will be 53 years to the day since the Queen opened the first Forth Road bridge in 1964 and she'll be accompanied - as she was then - by the Duke of Edinburgh, in his first official appearance since he retired from solo royal engagements last month. The Queensferry Crossing stretches 1.7 miles between the banks of the Forth and is the result of a 10-year project involving 35,000 tonnes of steel, 150,000 tonnes of concrete, 23,000 miles of steel cabling (almost enough cable to stretch around the equator), and a workforce drawn from 24 countries, coordinated with the help of a team of translators. Michael Martin, the project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, told Sky News: ""People always think of the engineering challenges but, for me, one of the most difficult challenges that I have is ensuring that I get the right people working in the right way so that the expertise that they have can be brought together in a team, which is an international team which has never worked together before. ""This has been a challenging job from the outset - building the towers, the tallest bridge towers in the UK, in very hostile conditions. You are basically in the North Sea and the wind conditions, in the winter in particular, are truly horrible. ""There isn't a day goes past where you don't get something thrown at you, a problem to be overcome. But that's what engineering is about. It's been pretty stressful on occasions, I've lost a few nights sleep, but you overcome that. ""Once we're finished... traffic is on the bridge... I'll be immensely proud and I know all my colleagues will be immensely proud of what we've achieved here."" The new bridge stands close to the iconic Forth (rail) Bridge, built in 1882, as well as the original road bridge. It represents a trilogy of engineering excellence through the centuries. The new road bridge will be used by private vehicles, while the old one will accommodate public transport, cyclists and pedestrians. High winds have often affected traffic on the first road bridge, causing closures and restrictions. The new one has perspex wind shields fitted on the side. Mike Glover, technical director of Forth Crossing Bridge Contractors, told Sky News: ""It acts as a wind scoop. As the wind approaches, it says 'mmm... the pressure's building up', and it pushes itself over the top. Some of it comes through but because we've left gaps in between it acts like a grill. ""The wind comes through not as gusty turbulence, it comes through as a linear flow of air. So the combination of the scooping over and the air coming through as a linear straight line is what gives it a much more enhanced environment than you get on the existing bridge."" The new bridge has been completed nine months behind schedule. It had been due to open last December, but adverse weather conditions have contributed to delays. The cost of construction is £1.3bn, far less than the original estimate of £2.3bn. The new bridge opens to traffic for the first time on Wednesday. It will then close on the 2 and 3 September for the Queensferry Crossing Experience, when 50,000 members of the public, won tickets in a ballot, will walk across the structure. On 5 September, an additional community day has been added, giving around 10,000 more people from local schools and community groups on both sides of the Forth the chance to walk on the bridge. From 6 September onwards the Queensferry Crossing will re-open to traffic, with no pedestrian access."
2017-08-26,"Jeremy Corbyn has thrown Labour’s welfare policy into confusion, by failing to deliver a promise to reverse the benefits freeze.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170827042822/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-leader-jeremy-corbyn-silent-on-lifting-benefit-freeze-in-coatbridge-speech-11006630,"The Labour leader, who was visiting marginal seats in Scotland, was due to announce the policy at a rally on Friday. In words released ahead of his appearance in Coatbridge, near Glasgow, journalists were sent a briefing note advising that he would say: ""We will lift the freeze on social security, using part of the billions we set aside for reform in our costed manifesto"". He did not say the line. What, therefore, is Labour's policy for some 10 million families affected by the freeze since 2016 on working-age benefits such as housing benefit, jobseekers' allowance and tax credits? Some commentators were cynical, seeing it as attempt to spin favourable headlines, while giving the policy deniability given that it will cost a hefty £3bn a year, which was not accounted for in the election manifesto. A Labour spokesman explained Mr Corbyn did intend to say the line and that the party was ""confident"" of delivering the policy if they form the next Government, which sounds a little less like a firm promise. Welfare savings have generated questions for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn for months, and reveal some of the fault lines within the party. Mr Corbyn and his allies feel vindicated by an election campaign which offered a clear rejection of austerity, and resonated with voters to a far greater degree than many in the Labour party or the Tories had expected. There is little doubt that he personally wants to see benefits uprated every year. On Friday, he railed against a ""social security system, which under the Tories is failing our pensioners, the working poor, and disabled people."" But while the election manifesto, which made big promises to students (to abolish fees), to pensioners (to keep their winter fuel allowance and triple lock) and to public services - all of which Labour outlined funding for - the money was not earmarked for this. The frontbench faced questions about this at the time, with business spokesman Barry Gardiner insisting in a TV interview that Mr Corbyn ""does not mean all benefits"" when he talked about lifting the freeze. Mr Corbyn himself, when grilled on Sky News by Jeremy Paxman, only said that benefits should rise and £2bn a year would be put into the system to ""reduce the effects"" of welfare cuts. Why reignite the confusion now? A spokesman explained to me the freeze could be lifted ""from day one"" of a Labour government, and that the party's plans for a £10 living wage and major housebuilding programme would reduce the welfare bill. Others I spoke to in the party were less clear on the timescale and whether the policy had his top team's support. It is far from unusual for parties in opposition, or in Government, to change their spending promises. Theresa May made an eye-catching promise to cap energy bills for 17 million bill payers, which was watered down into a request to the regulator to the look at the poorest value tariffs. Surrounded by the party faithful at rallies it is hard to resist the temptation to go further. But Labour under Mr Corbyn is already trusted as the party most concerned about increasing benefits to those who have seen them eroded for years. And it's the Conservatives, having abandoned their target to balance the books by 2020, who find themselves struggling to justify further cuts to public spending. Hinting, even in vague terms, that he would take action to cancel student debt has already landed him in hot water. With plenty of spending giveaways to offer already, why hand the Conservatives and crucially, floating voters, the opportunity to say that Labour's sums don't add up?"

Power to some homes was knocked out, and signs and pieces of palm tree littered the streets as the storm took hold. There are also reports of roofs collapsing into houses, trees being uprooted and buildings being destroyed. A county sheriff's department has also warned the public to be on the look out for alligators, washed out of their creek habitats by the storm surge and seeking higher ground.

The storm is expected to dump more than 3ft (90cm) of rain along the Texas coast and parts of Louisiana over several days. Harvey has been compared to one of America's deadliest storms - Hurricane Katrina - which killed more than a thousand people in New Orleans in 2005. New Orleans does not lie in Harvey's direct path. Donald Trump wrote on Twitter: ""At the request of the Governor of Texas, I have signed the Disaster Proclamation, which unleashes the full force of government help!"" The President is currently in Camp David ""closely watching the path and doings of Hurricane Harvey"". He earlier encouraged everyone in the path of the storm ""to heed the advice and orders of their local and state officials"". The National Hurricane Center described the storm as ""life-threatening, dangerous and catastrophic"". Sky News Correspondent Siobhan Robbins took shelter with some residents forced to leave their homes in the city of Corpus Christi on the Gulf of Mexico. She said: ""Officials have warned that this storm could cut off power and water and homes could be uninhabitable for months. ""Thousands have already been evacuated, but the worry is that people have heard all this before and still aren't getting themselves to safety."" Mayor of Rockport, Patrick Rios, warned residents remaining in the area to ""mark their arm with a Sharpie pen with their name and social security number"" to make it easier for rescuers to identify them. Seven counties in Texas have ordered mandatory evacuations, and tens of thousands of people left their homes ahead of the storm's arrival. Petrol prices shot up along the south Texas coast as stations ran out of fuel, and there have been reports of inflated consumer prices in some Texan supermarkets. Mr Trump is expected to visit Texas early next week."

It says just a third of the 29 self-service eGates at Heathrow Terminal 5 are ""routinely"" open and that they close ""prematurely"" at 11pm despite passengers still getting off planes, leading to ""massive queues and frustrating delays"". The comments came in a submission to the government as part of a consultation on scrapping landing cards. BA says the country must show it is ""an easy place to travel to"" as it prepares to leave the EU. Raghbir S Pattar, the company's director for Heathrow, said the Border Force must work in ""the most efficient and flexible way"". He said: ""It is a constant frustration to us and to our customers that after a long flight they have to stand in queues, sometimes for over an hour, just to get back into the country. ""And it is a dreadful welcome for visitors to the UK to be faced with a packed immigration hall and the prospect of a frustrating delay to the start of their holiday or business trip.

The 31-year-old father of three - described as a ""superhero daddy"" - died from inhaling fumes on 27 February 2016. On Friday, Keani Hobbs, 18, from Pitsea in Essex, was jailed for nine years for manslaughter and 12 months for theft, to run concurrently, following the incident on 27 February last year. The 16-year-old, from Camberwell in London, who cannot be named for legal reasons, got six years for manslaughter and a concurrent 12 months for theft. Judge Patricia Lynch said they were both equally culpable and had carried out the act ""for fun"". She said the 16-year-old had taken Hobbs to the vehicle ""knowing what was going to be done"", and that Hobbs's part was ""igniting the flare and throwing it into the car"". ""Neither of you realised the man was going to die, but you must have realised it would have caused harm,"" said the judge at Chelmsford Crown Court. ""Your actions were reckless, they were stupid and they were dangerous."" As the 16-year-old's lesser sentence of six years was read out, there was a shout from Hobbs' family of ""f****** soft spot corrupt b**** as far as I'm concerned"", directed at the judge. Some of them stormed out of the court. Hobbs, wearing a parka with a large fluffy hood, sobbed as she was led away and shouted ""I love you"" to her family.

Dat Cloudwater price pic.twitter.com/1Jca3740UB Utobeer, which operates The Rake, denied claims it was ""gouging our customers"" or making ""vast profits"". The firm said logistics meant the beer had to be ordered through a distributor, making it more expensive, and pointed out that at 9% strength it was ""never going to be cheap"". Utobeer said in a statement: ""We are not making 'vast profits', we work to a margin like all businesses and if we stopped we'd start losing money and eventually go out of business. ""Cloudwater will not deliver directly to us unless we order a pallet from them & if you know The Rake you'll also know we do not have the space to store a pallet; so this being the case we have to order through a distributor who will obviously put their margin on it."" The distributor Euroboozer also denied it was to blame for the high price and took the unusual step of publishing its own costs. A letter published by the firm's director said: ""The difference in our price compared to Cloudwater's list price is minimal. I don't mind telling you our gross profit on this keg is £22.39. ""When the cost of good beer goes over a certain price, we adjust our margins, look at our cash and say 'well, that's too much on a keg' and then adjust our pricing accordingly.

Blood tests which identify ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin can also be carried out at police stations. And it's not just illegal substances officers test for. Prescription drugs - including morphine, temazepam and amphetamines prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - can also take drivers over the legal limit. Laws introduced in 2015 made it illegal to drive with certain drugs in the body above a specified amount. Until 2015, police had to gather evidence to show a driver was impaired before they were able to carry out tests. With official conviction rates at an impressive 98%, drug driving offenders are now as likely to be brought to justice as drunk motorists. Offenders can face losing their licence, fines of up to £5,000 or even prison. The Department for Transport report showed that the majority of drivers screened for drug use were men under 30, with two-thirds of those convicted had previously committed other criminal offences. A spokesman for National Police Chiefs' Council said the legislation had made it ""much easier"" for police to identify those driving under the influence of drugs. But he said: ""Far too many people still attempt to drive under the influence of drugs."" Transport minister Paul Maynard said the new data showed ""that if you take drugs and drive, you will face the consequences""."

2017-08-26,"David Cameron was very fond of saying ""no ifs, no buts"" whenever he made an ambitious promise to voters.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170827042822/http://news.sky.com/story/immigration-figures-will-be-a-relief-for-theresa-may-11003896,"But more often than not they were promises that ended up being broken. In 2010, he said it when he promised there would be no third runway at Heathrow Airport. Then in October 2016, Theresa May gave the go-ahead for expansion at the west London hub. In 2014, during the Scottish referendum campaign, a rattled Mr Cameron gave a ""no ifs, no buts"" commitment to more powers for Scotland. But he was later accused of ""grubby politics"" when he linked a new deal for Scotland to ""English votes for English laws"" to give the Tories an advantage at Westminster. By far, Mr Cameron's most controversial ""no ifs, no buts"" pledge was his promise in 2010 to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands. A year later he declared in a speech on immigration: ""Our borders will be under control and immigration will be at levels our country can manage. ""No ifs. No buts. That's a promise we made to the British people. And it's a promise we are keeping."" But it was a promise that not even Theresa May, who was home secretary back then, thought the Tories had any hope of keeping. In a TV interview in 2014, she rather unhelpfully said it was likely to fail. But she still hasn't entirely jettisoned her predecessor's pledge - even though she prefers to talk these days about reducing immigration to sustainable levels. So the Government will be relieved that the latest quarterly migration figures, the first since the PM's General Election campaign spectacularly backfired, confirmed a downward trend after the figures three months ago showed a drop. No wonder Brandon Lewis, the bouffant-haired Eric Pickles protege who is now immigration minister, said on Sky News that the figures were encouraging but also mouthed the usual platitudes about no room for complacency. But then Mr Lewis was a tad sneaky, claiming the tens of thousands pledge was always a longer-term goal. Well, it wasn't when David Cameron first made his promise to voters back in 2010. This Government has form on this kind of backtracking on extravagant promises, after the Chancellor Philip Hammond pushed his predecessor George Osborne's 2020 budget surplus target back to 2022. Not everyone is happy about the falling net migration numbers, however. The Institute of Directors, normally friendly towards the Tories, is warning of a brain drain of EU staff and saying no one should celebrate. And Sir Vince Cable, who shows every sign of being hell-bent on settling old scores with his Coalition adversary Theresa May now he is back in the Commons, says the figures show a ""deeply worrying Brexodus of EU workers"". Wily Vince is also on the warpath over foreign students, after the Government admitted it massively overestimated the number who stay in the UK after graduating. After forecasting it was approximately 100,000, it turns out it's only about 4,000. How could the figures be so wildly inaccurate? It seems the Government thought most foreign students were staying here after completing their degree, whereas it seems most of them take their skills home with them. ""This debacle happened on Theresa May's watch at the Home Office,"" says Sir Vince, who claims he spent five years in coalition battling her bogus figures. Mrs May's successor, Amber Rudd, has now asked the migration advisory committee to hold an inquiry into the issue, a move that looks like paving the way for a u-turn that's already backed by some Cabinet ministers. At least David Cameron never gave a ""no ifs, no buts"" promise to take foreign students out of the immigration figures. Which means it will almost certainly happen."
2017-08-26,"The number of EU citizens applying for British citizenship has nearly doubled in the wake of the Brexit referendum, new figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170827042822/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-80-rise-in-number-of-eu-citizens-seeking-uk-passport-11005094,"The 80% rise in requests comes amid uncertainty over the status of EU citizens once Britain leaves the European Union in March 2019. This week, a different set of statistics showed thousands of EU citizens have been leaving the EU - bringing down the overall net migration figure. According to a Home Office report, there were 28,502 applications for British citizenship from EU nationals in the year ending June 2017 - up from 15,871 in the previous 12 months. Applications by citizens from Eastern European countries - among a group of 10 nations that joined the bloc in 2004 - rose by 45% to 9,841 in the year to June. Of those, 6,179 alone came from Polish people. Applications from some of the long-term members of the bloc rose sharply. Among them there were: :: 2,950 applications from Italians:: 2,508 applications from French citizens:: 2,338 applications from Germans The EU figure bucks the general downward trend in the overall numbers of foreigners seeking citizenship, which stood at 135,912 and was down 8% in the same period. The rights of more than three million EU citizens in the UK - and of 1.3m Britons living across the Channel - is one of the key issues of negotiations with Brussels. Both sides have called for a swift resolution, but the role of the European Court of Justice has emerged as a main stumbling block. The EU wants it to safeguard the rights of EU citizens after Britain leaves the union, while the UK insists ""direct jurisdiction"" of the court in the country comes to an end with Brexit. Other figures show a sharp rise in the number of documents issued to EU nationals certifying their right to live in the UK permanently, with more than 130,000 handed out in the year to the end of June. Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: ""Faced with the uncertainty of Brexit, it appears that EU citizens have responded in different ways - some have been trying to solidify their rights to remain in the UK, while others have been voting with their feet and leaving."" Foreigners must have lived in the UK for at least five years before they can seek British citizenship by naturalisation. An application costs £1,282 and successful applicants must take an oath of allegiance and pledge to respect the rights, freedoms and laws of the UK during a citizenship ceremony."

The cub is now being cared for by veterinary staff at San Diego Zoo Safari Park, who estimate it to be between five and six weeks old. It weighs a little over six pounds and the staff believe it to be in good health overall. The teenager, who has been charged with the attempted smuggling of the Bengal tiger club into the US, claimed in court that he had bought it on the streets of Tijuana for $300. Valencia faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if found guilty."

He then reached for the weapon in the passenger footwell, police said. CS gas was used during the arrest, in which three officers were injured. The 26-year-old from Luton is being held at a central London police station and a terror investigation is under way. Initially detained on suspicion of assault and grievous bodily harm, he was subsequently arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000. The incident happened in Constitution Hill, in a restricted area close to the Royal residence, shortly after 8.30pm on Friday. Commander Dean Haydon, of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism branch, said the suspect ""deliberately drove at a marked police vehicle and stopped in front of it"". He added: ""Uniformed officers then confronted the driver of the vehicle and during that confrontation the driver reached for a 4ft sword that was in the passenger footwell. ""CS gas was used as part of the arrest and during the struggle the individual repeatedly shouted the words Allahu Akbar."" Mr Haydon praised the bravery and courage of the injured officers in ""quickly bringing the incident under control"". He said he was confident that it was an ""isolated incident"" on what is due to be a busy bank holiday weekend, with events being held across the capital, including the Notting Hill Carnival. Several witnesses told Sky News they saw a man being ""wrestled to the ground"", and one German tourist described hearing a ""rumble"" followed by screaming. Kiana Williamson told the Press Association: ""We turned up and there was one police van and one car, there was also a civilian's car that had veered towards the police car. ""They were trying to get the man out of the car, shouting, more police were arriving on to the scene and the man was fighting back."" In a tweet on Saturday, Prime Minister Theresa May praised officers who helped at the scene, saying: ""I want to thank the officers who acted quickly and bravely to protect the public last night... demonstrating the dedication and professionalism of our police."" No members of the Royal Family were in residence at the time of the attack, with the Queen currently on her annual Scottish holiday in Balmoral."
2017-08-26,Mercury shortlisted guitar group The Big Moon are sick of the music industry putting everyone in boxes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170827042822/http://news.sky.com/story/girls-guitars-and-sexism-in-the-music-industry-11005920,"Guitarist Soph Nathann says: ""Because there's not enough [women] out there it's like a separate genre - rock, pop, then women!"" I catch up with the guitar band - whose album Love in the 4th Dimension made the Mercury shortlist for 2017 - just before they take to the stage for the Reading leg of the Reading and Leeds Festivals. They are one of just a handful of all-female bands to make it onto the bill. Bassist Celia Archer says it's something most female rock groups have come to accept: ""Society is still generally sexist, it's ingrained. It's such an entrenched problem but hopefully it's slowly getting better."" This year, embarrassed festival organisers across the UK found themselves having to apologise after almost all headline slots went to men. The gender imbalance has been a stark reflection of how the music scene tends to be skewed towards a male demographic. Californian rockers Deep Valley say, put simply, women trying to succeed in rock have to work twice as hard to make it. ""You're a novelty at first as a female musician,"" drummer Julie Edwards explains. ""You have a surge and then it plateaus out… It seems like the male rock bands have a more lubricated ride to the top."" Male rock groups might have secured top billing, but could female spending power be key to reviving guitar sales which, over a decade, have flat-lined? Guitar-maker Fender is doing all it can ""to support and cater"" for female buyers. The iconic music brand found 50% of its new sales last year were to women. Its CEO, Andy Mooney, says the industry is finally waking up to that fact: ""The guitar business… has often been viewed as a boys' club. ""We are constantly identifying new artists and incorporating female talent into our marketing launches."" Fender isn't alone in recognising the importance of opening up the market. A concerted industry effort is under way to find new ways of reaching out to women. Paul McManus, chief executive of the Music Industries Association, says companies are finally starting to wise-up to the fact that women who love music are just as vital to the industry as men. ""The industry is gradually moving away from the stereotypical marketing imagery of the average guitarist being a long-haired male in full rock pose... to appeal more to both genders."" But the music scene still has quite some way to go. Chantel McGregor has been playing since she was three. Now in her early 30s, she is one of Britain's best guitarists. Currently on tour, she's carved out a career in music, singing and performing blisteringly complicated electric guitar solos. But when she was just 14, a major music label told her to switch to an acoustic because men might struggle to buy into her sound. She said: ""You can still go into a guitar shop in a dress and people go up to you and say 'this is plectrum, do you know what one is?' and I'm like 'yes!' ""A lot of music manufacturers probably think it's mainly men that they're catering for but women want to spend money on things like guitars, not shoes and handbags or whatever it is we're perceived to buy."" Specialist music fanzine Ladyfuzz was born out of musician Lucinda Livingstone's frustration over seeing lazy stereotypes. The Kamikaze Girls vocalist and guitarist said: ""When I was a kid I wasn't introduced to guitar music that had females in it, I had to find that by myself and I don't think it has to be like that."" ""Making things like press materials and advertising more friendly and more gender fluid would be way better. Not just having a picture of a guy with a guitar or a picture of a girl used in a sexual way to advertise music. Reading and Leeds Festivals are on until 27 August."

Another woman was taken to hospital but her injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Two men - a 31-year-old from Worcestershire and a 53-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent - have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. The former is also in custody on suspicion of driving while over the alcohol limit following the collision at just before 3.15am on Saturday. The vehicles collided while travelling on the southbound carriageway between junctions 15 and 14. ""Some of those involved were visiting the UK from India - we're working to keep the families abroad informed,"" said Chief Inspector Henry Parsons from Thames Valley Police. Ollie Miller, who drove past the scene on Saturday morning, told Sky News: ""It looked horrible, the two lorries were smashed badly and I could see a car or minibus underneath one of the lorries. It was totally destroyed, the car/minibus was basically flat."" It is believed the minibus had travelled from the Nottingham area. The motorway has now been fully reopened. Police have urged anyone who saw the incident to call the 24-hour Thames Valley Police enquiry centre on 101. AIM Logistics and FedEx confirmed their lorries were involved in the crash. AIM director, Ismail Elmagdoub, said: ""We would like to express our deepest sympathy to the families who have lost loved ones and also those whom have been injured at this very sad time. ""Road safety and compliance is of the utmost importance to AIM Logistics and we are continuing to assist the police as much as possible with their inquiries."" FedEx said its ""deepest thoughts and concerns are with all of those involved"". The delivery company added: ""Safety is of the utmost importance to FedEx, and we are cooperating fully with authorities but have no further information at this time."""
2017-08-26,"Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins could have been caught nearly four years earlier if South Wales Police had investigated the case properly, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170827042822/http://news.sky.com/story/paedo-watkins-could-have-been-caught-earlier-11004168,"South Wales Police officers missed a series of chances to stop the Lostprophets singer's abuse of children in the years before he was arrested. Watkins was jailed for 29 years in December 2013 after admitting sexual offences, including the attempted rape of a fan's baby. It came after his arrest in September 2012 following the execution of a drugs warrant at his Pontypridd home, which also resulted in computers, mobile phones and storage devices being seized. The IPCC said that prior to that, between 2008 and 2012, officers had failed to adequately action eight reports and three intelligence logs from six individuals about Watkins' activities. One of these was from Watkins' ex-girlfriend Joanne Mjadzelics, who reported him in December 2008 and was interviewed on video three months later. She told officers she had a message on her mobile phone from Watkins saying he wanted to sexually abuse children. The report said the phone was not examined because her report was thought to have been ""malicious"". IPCC commissioner for Wales Jan Williams said there was no evidence showing the inaction was due to Watkins' fame but it was instead officers' assessment that Ms Mjadzelics lacked credibility. But Crimestoppers reports from 2010 and reports from two witnesses that year and in 2012 did ""not appear to have been progressed"", despite supporting Ms Mjadzelics's account. Ms Williams said that the failures involved a small number of officers who had shown a ""lack of open-mindedness and professional curiosity"". ""This continued until 'the right type of complainant' came along,"" she said. The investigation also found poor record keeping and retention; poor management of intelligence; weaknesses in safeguarding and supervision; a lack of rigour in progressing investigations; the handling of third party reports as opposed to those from victims; and an inadequate approach to cross border investigations. Assistant Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said the force ""entirely accepts and regrets"" the failings highlighted by the report. He added: ""South Wales Police failed to listen and properly investigate information about Watkins' offending behaviour, for this we are truly sorry. ""The review instigated as a result of Watkins' arrest led to significant changes being made to the way we investigate crimes of this nature. ""I am confident that police officers and staff who work in this very challenging area care deeply about the service they provide to victims. ""I know it is difficult taking that first step in reporting child abuse and that people coming forward need support but we urge anyone with concerns about a child or young person to get in touch with us immediately."" The news comes just days after the IPCC made similar criticisms of South Yorkshire Police's handling of the case, saying three officers could have faced charges of gross misconduct but, as they had all retired after 30 years, no action could be taken."

The Met tweeted about the seizure of what was believed to be a kilogram of uncut heroin in Catford, southeast London. The Twitter post led UK grime artist Stormzy to reply: ""How many drugs did you lot seize in the run up to Glastonbury or we only doing tweets like this for black events?"" Metropolitan Police commander David Musker, in charge of policing the Notting Hill event, has responded to criticism, saying: ""I think the public would expect us to do what we can to prevent those injuries to people coming to carnival."" ""My job is to keep people safe who go to carnival, and I am unapologetic about doing that. ""But that is the point of doing that. To get people who would normally come to carnival to cause problems off the streets before the event."" Chief superintendent Robyn Williams said: ""It isn't exclusive to carnival, we would put it in place for a whole range of large-scale events. In terms of carnival we are uncompromising in our efforts for it to be safe and secure this year."" More than 450 people were arrested over the two days of festivities in 2016, with around 300 detained in the preceding crackdown. Mr Musker said it is a ""fallacy"" to suspect that people caught in possession of heroin are not going to carnival."
2017-08-26,"In a dramatic policy shift, Labour is pledging to continue UK membership of the EU single market and the customs union during a transitional period following Brexit in March 2019.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170827042822/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-labour-wants-uk-to-stay-in-eu-single-market-during-transition-period-11008071,"The party's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has also not ruled out negotiating the possibility of a new single market and customs arrangement on a permanent basis. Effectively, a Labour government would try to keep Britain inside an economic union while leaving the political union with the European Union. At the general election, Labour promised to seek to ""retain the benefits"" of the single market and customs union as part of a ""jobs-first"" Brexit. But party leader Jeremy Corbyn has so far stopped short of committing to continued membership beyond the date of Brexit. However, writing in The Observer, Mr Starmer said a Labour government would abide by ""the same basic terms"" of Britain's current EU membership during the transition - which could last as long as four or five years. The clarification of position by the opposition piles pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit Secretary David Davis ahead of the resumption of talks in Brussels on Monday. With a rump of Conservative MPs agreeing with Labour's position, it is now unlikely the Government has a Commons majority to leave the single market during any transition period. Mr Starmer wrote: ""Labour would seek a transitional deal that maintains the same basic terms that we currently enjoy with the EU. ""That means we would seek to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during this period. It means we would abide by the common rules of both."" He added: ""We will always put jobs and the economy first. ""That means remaining in a form of customs union with the EU is a possible end destination for Labour, but that must be subject to negotiations. ""It also means that Labour is flexible as to whether the benefits of the single market are best retained by negotiating a new single market relationship or by working up from a bespoke trade deal."" Staying in the single market beyond March 2019 would mean the UK continues to abide by EU rules on free movement, accepts the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in trade issues, and pays money to Brussels. Labour's move came as David Davis lashed out at Brussels and demanded the European Commission be more ""flexible"" in negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the EU. With the third round of formal talks beginning on Bank Holiday Monday in the Belgian capital, he is pushing for EU negotiator Michel Barnier to be less rigid in his refusal to discuss the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and Europe. Mr Barnier insists progress must be made on key aspects of the withdrawal deal, including the UK's ""divorce bill"", ex-pat citizens' rights and the Irish border, before there is any talk of future arrangements for crucial issues such as trade. Britain wants to negotiate its future relationship with the EU alongside the divorce settlement."

After using a sledgehammer and crowbar to create a hole in the wall of the store, they spent three hours inside before escaping with gold and diamond necklaces, bracelets, pendants and earrings. Police say three men entered the shop while the others acted as lookouts. CCTV footage of the raid on 10 July has just been released, and officers are appealing to anyone with information to get in touch. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Pallett, of Newham CID, said: ""While we think it only took the suspects around 20 minutes to make the hole, it must have been noisy work. ""Several men were hanging around the area for a number of hours before the raid... The area was busy with shoppers and passers-by. If you have any information, no matter how small, please come forward."" One of the men wore a distinctive pink hooded top, DCI Pallett said, while another had a black coat.

Resident Huey Walker, 39, who has been involved in the run-up to the carnival, said: ""I think people see it as an opportunity to continue the healing of what's happened in the community and keep the message of what's happened in the public eye as well.

The carnival will open on Sunday morning with a prayer and release of doves as a ""small act of remembrance"", and will continue on Monday. On both days at 3pm, festival-goers are expected to observe a minute's silence to mark the tragedy, which claimed the lives of at least 80 people. Chair of the carnival trust Pepe Francis said he hoped the festivities would ""lift the spirits of people"". He said: ""Obviously there's varying views, some people feel it shouldn't. But the majority feel it should, and it should be one of the best carnivals."" As part of policing plans for the event, steel barriers, concrete blocks and weapons checks will be in place to help guard against the threat of a Barcelona-style terror attack and acid attacks. Officers also plan to use facial recognition technology in a bid to spot those thought to be likely to cause trouble. Meanwhile, it has emerged hotel bills and expenses resulting from the fire have so far cost the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) more than £6.3m. This figure includes more than £4.2m being spent on emergency accommodation for hundreds of survivors since 14 June. A series of fire safety tests carried out on cladding on high-rise tower blocks following the Grenfell disaster have also now concluded and found 228 buildings at risk. An independent review of building regulations and fire safety was announced by the Government last month."

2017-08-28,"David Cameron was very fond of saying ""no ifs, no buts"" whenever he made an ambitious promise to voters.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170828201136/http://news.sky.com/story/immigration-figures-will-be-a-relief-for-theresa-may-11003896,"But more often than not they were promises that ended up being broken. In 2010, he said it when he promised there would be no third runway at Heathrow Airport. Then in October 2016, Theresa May gave the go-ahead for expansion at the west London hub. In 2014, during the Scottish referendum campaign, a rattled Mr Cameron gave a ""no ifs, no buts"" commitment to more powers for Scotland. But he was later accused of ""grubby politics"" when he linked a new deal for Scotland to ""English votes for English laws"" to give the Tories an advantage at Westminster. By far, Mr Cameron's most controversial ""no ifs, no buts"" pledge was his promise in 2010 to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands. A year later he declared in a speech on immigration: ""Our borders will be under control and immigration will be at levels our country can manage. ""No ifs. No buts. That's a promise we made to the British people. And it's a promise we are keeping."" But it was a promise that not even Theresa May, who was home secretary back then, thought the Tories had any hope of keeping. In a TV interview in 2014, she rather unhelpfully said it was likely to fail. But she still hasn't entirely jettisoned her predecessor's pledge - even though she prefers to talk these days about reducing immigration to sustainable levels. So the Government will be relieved that the latest quarterly migration figures, the first since the PM's General Election campaign spectacularly backfired, confirmed a downward trend after the figures three months ago showed a drop. No wonder Brandon Lewis, the bouffant-haired Eric Pickles protege who is now immigration minister, said on Sky News that the figures were encouraging but also mouthed the usual platitudes about no room for complacency. But then Mr Lewis was a tad sneaky, claiming the tens of thousands pledge was always a longer-term goal. Well, it wasn't when David Cameron first made his promise to voters back in 2010. This Government has form on this kind of backtracking on extravagant promises, after the Chancellor Philip Hammond pushed his predecessor George Osborne's 2020 budget surplus target back to 2022. Not everyone is happy about the falling net migration numbers, however. The Institute of Directors, normally friendly towards the Tories, is warning of a brain drain of EU staff and saying no one should celebrate. And Sir Vince Cable, who shows every sign of being hell-bent on settling old scores with his Coalition adversary Theresa May now he is back in the Commons, says the figures show a ""deeply worrying Brexodus of EU workers"". Wily Vince is also on the warpath over foreign students, after the Government admitted it massively overestimated the number who stay in the UK after graduating. After forecasting it was approximately 100,000, it turns out it's only about 4,000. How could the figures be so wildly inaccurate? It seems the Government thought most foreign students were staying here after completing their degree, whereas it seems most of them take their skills home with them. ""This debacle happened on Theresa May's watch at the Home Office,"" says Sir Vince, who claims he spent five years in coalition battling her bogus figures. Mrs May's successor, Amber Rudd, has now asked the migration advisory committee to hold an inquiry into the issue, a move that looks like paving the way for a u-turn that's already backed by some Cabinet ministers. At least David Cameron never gave a ""no ifs, no buts"" promise to take foreign students out of the immigration figures. Which means it will almost certainly happen."

The 52-year-old, who owned minibus firm ABC Travels, was taking the group from Nottingham to Wembley Stadium to join a tour group for Europe when the crash happened. His friend Manu Zachariah paid tribute to a dedicated father who loved his family and friends. ""Cyriac was not like normal fathers,"" he said. ""He would love to spend his money and time on his children like none of his friends. ""He was always very encouraging of their extracurricular activities. His son is an athlete and he would take him to javelin training. ""He was an extraordinary father, and would do anything for his friends. He was always there for us and will be really missed."" Mr Zachariah said he believed Mr Joseph and his family moved to the UK about 15 years ago. He said Mr Joseph started his minibus business around four years ago and made mostly airport trips and similar journeys. ""He was a very close friend of mine and we used to work together,"" he said. ""It is very shocking and we don't want to believe that he is not alive... he was part of every part of our lives. ""It is a big loss to the community."" He said Mr Joseph was very active in the church community and the local cultural association, and was also a keen singer and sportsman who enjoyed volleyball. Three other victims were Karthikeyan Ramasubramaniyam Pugalur, Rishi Rajeev Kumar and Vivek Bhaskaran, who all worked for IT firm Wipro. Another Wipro employee, Mano Ranjan Panneerselvam, was critically injured. In a statement, the firm said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who lost their lives in this tragedy. We will continue to provide all assistance to the families in this hour of grief."" Three other passengers - a five-year-old girl, a man and a woman - remain in hospital with life-threatening injuries following the crash, which happened at about 3.15am on Saturday. They have not been named. Lorry drivers Ryszard Masierak, 31, and David Wagstaff, 53, have been charged with eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving and four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Masierak was also charged with eight counts of causing death by careless driving while over the alcohol limit and has been remanded in custody. Wagstaff is on bail to appear at Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court on 11 September."

Police are now trying to determine what type of gas caused the ""chemical haze"", which now appears to have dissipated. Consultant toxicologist Dr John Hoskins said it may have been generated from German or French traffic pollution which drifted over the English Channel, and could reappear again. He told Sky News: ""Certainly it came across the Channel because it is in a peculiar part of the country to get anything that was generated in even the nearest large town, Brighton. ""(Its concentration) was just a meteorological phenomenon, you have to know exactly how the wind blows. ""It seems the weather generally tends to push things into that part of the coast… the tides and the winds go that way."" Dr Hoskins added that Sunday's hot and sunny weather ""created essentially what was photochemical smog which contained a number of chemicals dangerous to health"". ""There was also the so-called smell of chlorine,"" he said. ""That was almost certainly not chlorine, it was the smell of ozone which is a very similar smell. ""Ozone goes for the chest and or the heart. It is impossible to predict and it could have blown up into the air or in this case it blew down to ground level. ""It's a phenomenon we are liable to find on the streets of any town or city."" Public Health England is urging anyone who is still suffering the effects of irritation to irrigate their eyes and wash any other agitated areas with plenty of soap and water. Irritation was initially reported by tourists visiting the clifftops and beach at Birling Gap near Eastbourne just before 5pm. The effects of the haze were also reported as far as Bexhill and towards Hastings, more than 20 miles away. Mark Battershill, who was one of those affected, told Sky News he was left with stinging eyes and a sore throat after coming into contact with the mystery chemical. He said some people had complained that they were having difficulty breathing. Conditions are being monitored at Birling Gap, a popular tourist hotspot, throughout Bank Holiday Monday."

He explained: ""She's had two magnificent kids who have done fantastic things and will continue to do great things. And I would say that actually has saved the Royal Family. ""There was a time when Britain could have easily become a republic, a few years before her death. ""But now the thought of that has gone completely and I think that's largely to due to her two wonderful children."" Sir Richard first met Diana when she stayed on Necker Island, his private island paradise, with a young Prince William and Prince Harry. Their regular tennis matches were often a time when she would talk about the more difficult aspects of her life in the public eye. He said: ""We used to play tennis together - she won of course. We'd obviously talk afterwards, she'd had a lot of struggles, and particularly in the last two or three years of her life, she would open up about them. ""She put on a very strong face about it and just got on with her life."" Sir Richard also recalled Diana's sense of fun - and how she had ""everybody in fits of laughter"" during a Virgin Atlantic flight. ""She went into the cockpit with Prince William on her knee and she got on the loudspeaker to everybody in the plane and said 'if you look out to the left you will see granny's house' as we flew over Windsor Castle,"" he said. Comedian Ruby Wax, who was also a friend of the Princess, recalls being totally star-struck the first time she met Diana. She said: ""As she shook my hand I went into a plie position, and I couldn't pull out. I froze, with my legs in the second position in ballet as we call it."" Wax has recently worked with Prince William and Prince Harry on their Heads Together campaign. She believes that, like their mother, they are shining a light on causes that traditionally have been surrounded by stigma. ""Mental health has such bad implications, so I would rather that they're the representatives than someone who is on screen. These are clean, healthy, smart, sexy boys,"" Wax added. On Wednesday, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will meet representatives from some of the charities that their mother supported in the sunken garden at Kensington Palace. This year the garden has been given a special white theme in memory of Diana, who often used to stop and talk to the gardeners working on the grounds. Thursday marks the 20th anniversary of the day Diana died in a car accident in Paris. She was 36 years old. :: Watch Sky News' documentary Diana: The People's Princess at 8pm tonight."
2017-08-28,"Princess Diana, her boyfriend Dodi al Fayed and their driver all lost their lives after the car they were travelling in crashed in Paris.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170828201136/http://news.sky.com/story/trevor-rees-jones-what-happened-to-the-sole-survivor-of-dianas-crash-11005463,"Only one person inside the Mercedes survived: Trevor Rees-Jones. He was Mr al Fayed's bodyguard and was sat in the front seat at the time of the devastating collision in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel early on 31 August 1997. No one inside the car had been wearing seatbelts, with Mr al Fayed and driver Henri Paul declared dead at the scene. But when emergency workers arrived at the wreckage, they discovered that Diana and Mr Rees-Jones were alive - albeit with serious injuries. They would both be taken to Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital - and Princess Diana, who arrived for emergency treatment first, would be pronounced dead within hours. Although Mr Rees-Jones was conscious, he was trapped inside the wreckage and was suffering from severe facial trauma. The roof of the Mercedes had to be cut away by firefighters before he too could be taken to hospital. Mr Rees-Jones was sedated for almost two weeks after the crash, and suffered amnesia for many months afterwards. In the mid-2000s, expert witnesses told a Metropolitan Police investigation that Mr Rees-Jones had a ""very limited recall"" of what happened immediately before and after the crash - and this was unlikely to ever change. Dr Maurice Lipsedge, a psychiatrist, had said: ""Trevor Rees-Jones remembers getting into the Mercedes in the Rue Cambon and the car driving off, he remembers nothing after that. ""A few snatches might come back to him but his memories are not at all reliable because even for him it is impossible to tell if these are genuine memories or reconstructions of events from information he might have had later, dreams or imagination."" The conclusion that Mr Rees-Jones had suffered memory loss was challenged by Mohamed al Fayed - Dodi's father. The elder al Fayed had claimed the bodyguard ""knew exactly what happened"" before the Mercedes entered the tunnel, as well as details the security services were eager to suppress. Although Mr Rees-Jones was eager to return to work, he resigned from his job with Mr al Fayed in April 1998 on the advice of his solicitors. The bodyguard later claimed he had felt pressured by the business magnate to remember what had happened. In 2000, Mr Rees-Jones published his memoirs entitled The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, The Crash And The Sole Survivor. Mr al Fayed further alleged that this book was a ""tissue of lies"" and had actually been written by the security services in an attempt to support the British authorities' conclusion that Diana and Dodi had died in a ""simple traffic accident"". Operation Paget, the police inquiry set up in 2004 to investigate conspiracy theories surrounding Diana's death, concluded there was no evidence that Mr Rees-Jones remembered the crash - nor was their evidence that the security services were involved in the production of his book. Mr al Fayed had also claimed that the bodyguard had been given a senior job in United Nations security as ""an inducement to ensure his continued silence"" - another claim dismissed by Operation Paget. Mr Rees-Jones has given very few interviews in the years since the crash, keeping out of the public eye. According to The Sun, he now lives in Shropshire after holding several roles abroad - with friends telling the newspaper he had ""done really well for himself"" by working in Texas as a security director for the American oil company Halliburton."
2017-08-28,"Jeremy Corbyn has thrown Labour’s welfare policy into confusion, by failing to deliver a promise to reverse the benefits freeze.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170828201136/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-leader-jeremy-corbyn-silent-on-lifting-benefit-freeze-in-coatbridge-speech-11006630,"The Labour leader, who was visiting marginal seats in Scotland, was due to announce the policy at a rally on Friday. In words released ahead of his appearance in Coatbridge, near Glasgow, journalists were sent a briefing note advising that he would say: ""We will lift the freeze on social security, using part of the billions we set aside for reform in our costed manifesto"". He did not say the line. What, therefore, is Labour's policy for some 10 million families affected by the freeze since 2016 on working-age benefits such as housing benefit, jobseekers' allowance and tax credits? Some commentators were cynical, seeing it as attempt to spin favourable headlines, while giving the policy deniability given that it will cost a hefty £3bn a year, which was not accounted for in the election manifesto. A Labour spokesman explained Mr Corbyn did intend to say the line and that the party was ""confident"" of delivering the policy if they form the next Government, which sounds a little less like a firm promise. Welfare savings have generated questions for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn for months, and reveal some of the fault lines within the party. Mr Corbyn and his allies feel vindicated by an election campaign which offered a clear rejection of austerity, and resonated with voters to a far greater degree than many in the Labour party or the Tories had expected. There is little doubt that he personally wants to see benefits uprated every year. On Friday, he railed against a ""social security system, which under the Tories is failing our pensioners, the working poor, and disabled people."" But while the election manifesto, which made big promises to students (to abolish fees), to pensioners (to keep their winter fuel allowance and triple lock) and to public services - all of which Labour outlined funding for - the money was not earmarked for this. The frontbench faced questions about this at the time, with business spokesman Barry Gardiner insisting in a TV interview that Mr Corbyn ""does not mean all benefits"" when he talked about lifting the freeze. Mr Corbyn himself, when grilled on Sky News by Jeremy Paxman, only said that benefits should rise and £2bn a year would be put into the system to ""reduce the effects"" of welfare cuts. Why reignite the confusion now? A spokesman explained to me the freeze could be lifted ""from day one"" of a Labour government, and that the party's plans for a £10 living wage and major housebuilding programme would reduce the welfare bill. Others I spoke to in the party were less clear on the timescale and whether the policy had his top team's support. It is far from unusual for parties in opposition, or in Government, to change their spending promises. Theresa May made an eye-catching promise to cap energy bills for 17 million bill payers, which was watered down into a request to the regulator to the look at the poorest value tariffs. Surrounded by the party faithful at rallies it is hard to resist the temptation to go further. But Labour under Mr Corbyn is already trusted as the party most concerned about increasing benefits to those who have seen them eroded for years. And it's the Conservatives, having abandoned their target to balance the books by 2020, who find themselves struggling to justify further cuts to public spending. Hinting, even in vague terms, that he would take action to cancel student debt has already landed him in hot water. With plenty of spending giveaways to offer already, why hand the Conservatives and crucially, floating voters, the opportunity to say that Labour's sums don't add up?"

""If we don't release now, the volume of uncontrolled water around the dams will be higher and have a greater impact on the surrounding communities,"" said Colonel Lars Zetterstrom. The head of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Brock Long, has described the worst flooding in Texas in 50 years as a ""landmark event"".

But Kenya's environment minister Judy Wakhungu insisted manufacturers would be predominantly targeted first. ""Ordinary wananchi will not be harmed,"" she said, using a Kiswahili word for ""common man"". The East African nation joins more than 40 other countries that have banned, partly banned or taxed single-use plastic bags, including China, France, Rwanda, and Italy. Many bags drift into the ocean, strangling turtles, suffocating seabirds and filling the stomachs of dolphins and whales with waste until they die of starvation. Pastic bags can take between 500 and 1,000 years to break down. ""If we continue like this, by 2050, we will have more plastic in the ocean than fish,"" said Habib El-Habr, an expert on marine litter working with the UN Environment Programme in Kenya. But not everyone in Kenya is a fan of the ban. The country's Association of Manufacturers said it would cost 60,000 jobs and force 176 manufacturers to close. ""The knock-on effects will be very severe,"" a spokesman said. ""It will even affect the women who sell vegetables in the market - how will their customers carry their shopping home?"" Kenya is a major exporter of plastic bags in Africa, but big supermarket chains have started offering customers cloth bags as an alternative. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"

Blood tests which identify ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin can also be carried out at police stations. And it's not just illegal substances officers test for. Prescription drugs - including morphine, temazepam and amphetamines prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - can also take drivers over the legal limit. Laws introduced in 2015 made it illegal to drive with certain drugs in the body above a specified amount. Until 2015, police had to gather evidence to show a driver was impaired before they were able to carry out tests. With official conviction rates at an impressive 98%, drug driving offenders are now as likely to be brought to justice as drunk motorists. Offenders can face losing their licence, fines of up to £5,000 or even prison. The Department for Transport report showed that the majority of drivers screened for drug use were men under 30, with two-thirds of those convicted had previously committed other criminal offences. A spokesman for National Police Chiefs' Council said the legislation had made it ""much easier"" for police to identify those driving under the influence of drugs. But he said: ""Far too many people still attempt to drive under the influence of drugs."" Transport minister Paul Maynard said the new data showed ""that if you take drugs and drive, you will face the consequences""."

The 30-year-old's high-speed journey was captured on police dash cams and by a West Midlands Police helicopter, before ending when he hit a traffic island and smashed into a car at a petrol station in Castle Bromwich. After crashing his £85,000 BMW M3, Farooq climbed into the back seat with two other passengers and claimed not to have been the driver. Last week, a jury at Birmingham Crown Court found him guilty of dangerous driving and driving while disqualified. CCTV from earlier in the evening showed the BMW's driver wearing clothes that matched his. Farooq, who was already banned from driving for speeding off from a police traffic stop last year, was jailed for two-and-a-half years. He was also banned from driving for 10 years. PC Robert Lattimer, from West Midlands Police's roads policing unit, said: ""This was reckless driving by someone who should not have been behind the wheel. ""Officers had suspicions around the vehicle and tried to pull it over; but Farooq failed to stop and hit speeds of 115mph in 30mph zones.

2017-08-28,"Diana, Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997, after a car she was travelling in crashed in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170828201136/http://news.sky.com/story/everything-we-know-about-the-death-of-diana-princess-of-wales-10988168,"Why was Diana in Paris? Diana was in the French capital with Dodi Fayed - the son of former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed. The couple had been dating for a few weeks, and were planning to spend one night at Dodi's father's Hotel Ritz Paris before heading back to London. The pair had flown into Le Bourget airfield in Paris from Sardinia earlier that day, having spent nine days together on Mohamed Al Fayed's yacht - Jonikal - on the French and Italian Riviera. They had intended to go to a restaurant for dinner that evening, but due to the high level of paparazzi interest in their movements, they changed their plans. The night of the accident Instead, the couple decide to head to Dodi's apartment in Rue Arsene Houssaye, a short distance from the hotel, just off the Avenue des Champs-Elysees The last-minute decision to change plans meant that the hotel's acting security manager, Henri Paul, was called back to the hotel to chauffeur them. He had been off-duty for three hours and had drunk two double shots of a licorice-flavored aperitif called Ricard - the equivalent of four single shots of whisky - at the hotel bar before getting into the car. Diana's two bodyguards left in a decoy car from the front of the hotel as an attempt to divert photographers. At the hotel's rear entrance in rue Cambon, Diana and Dodi got into the back of a hired 1994 black Mercedes-Benz S280. The Mercedes was driven by Paul, and they were accompanied by Dodi's bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones who sat in the front passenger seat. As they left the hotel, Paul is reported to have said to paparazzi: ""Don't try to follow us - you won't be able to catch up"". The crash It was a four-minute drive from the hotel to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel. As the car approached the underpass it was travelling at around 65mph - double the speed limit. Inside the tunnel, the Mercedes clipped a white Fiat Uno, before veering left, right, then finally left on the two-lane carriageway, smashing into the 13th pillar of the tunnel. The car hit the corner of the pillar, meaning that it was unable to crumple - and so absorb the kinetic energy of the crash - as it was designed to. A collision investigator later described the narrow point of impact as ""supremely unlucky"". The car then spun and hit the stone wall of the tunnel backwards before coming to a stop. Fatalities A French doctor who was driving through the tunnel was one of the first people on the scene, calling the emergency services and giving an initial medical assessment. He described Diana as unconscious, but breathing. He reported just a few drops of blood on her forehead, but said her face appeared otherwise uninjured. Dodi Fayed and Henri Paul were pronounced dead at the scene. Diana was treated for nearly 40 minutes by the ambulance medical team at the scene of the crash, before being driven to Pitie-Salpetriere hospital. Accompanied by several police motorcyclists, the ambulance had to travel slowly due to the nature of Diana's injuries, and at one point had to stop while her condition was stabilised. She was unconscious when she arrived at the hospital, and went into cardiac arrest at around 2.10am. Diana was pronounced dead at 4am on the morning of 31 August 1997, aged 36. Dodi's bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, was the only survivor. Due to serious head injuries, he remembered very little about the crash. The French judicial investigation The 18-month French judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that Diana's death was caused by the chauffeur's high-speed driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Blood tests later showed he was two times the UK drink-drive limit. The combination of alcohol, the anti-depressant Prozac and Tiapridal - used to counter alcohol dependency - was ruled to have left him in ""a state that prevented him from keeping control of his vehicle when he was driving at high speed."" The report also noted that the Mercedes had clipped a white Fiat Uno as it entered the underpass. The car was never traced. Press photographers following the car were not found to have caused the crash. The report stated that both Diana and Fayed would have survived the crash had they been wearing safety belts. Operation Paget In 2004 the Metropolitan Police began a criminal investigation called Operation Paget, examining the various conspiracy theories surrounding Diana's death. The inquiry was legally necessary, and was requested by the coroner after the inquests into the deaths began. The then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, retraced Diana's final journey during the investigation. He commented that the ""massive impact"" from the blow was still visible in the pillar of the Paris underpass. Accident Investigation experts from Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) assisted the police enquiry. In the report, collision investigator Anthony Read noted that Paul had lost control of the Mercedes well before the entrance to the tunnel. He said the collision with the white Fiat occurred after the loss of control, and so was irrelevant, and not the cause of the crash. It also found that none of the occupants of the car were wearing a seatbelt. They found no faults with the seatbelts within the vehicle. The report concluded that the deaths were the result of a tragic accident. The British inquest A British inquest was opened in 2004 but was immediately adjourned by the royal coroner so that he could examine the 6,000-page document compiled by the French authorities during their investigation. The inquest was re-started in 2007, concluding in 2008 after six months of evidence. Unlike the French investigation, blame was cast on the paparazzi as well as driver Paul Henri. A verdict of ""unlawful killing"" due to the ""gross negligence"" of driver Henri Paul and the paparazzi was returned. The jury also said ""the impairment of the judgement of the driver of the Mercedes [Henri Paul] through alcohol"" and the fact that none of those who died were wearing seatbelts had contributed to the deaths. The man widely believed to have been the driver of the white Fiat clipped by the Mercedes - a French-Vietnamese taxi driver called Le Van Thanh - could not be compelled to give evidence in a British court as he was a French citizen. Coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker ruled out the possibility of concluding that the couple were murdered due to insufficient evidence. Where is Diana buried? Following Diana's death there was a public outpouring of grief like no other before. More than a million people lined the route of her funeral from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey on 6 September 1997. Her coffin left Kensington Palace on a gun carriage, with her brother Charles Spencer, the Duke of Edinburgh, her two sons - Prince William and Prince Harry - and her former husband Prince Charles, walking behind. The globally televised funeral was watched by 2.5 billion. After the ceremony, Diana was driven 77 miles to her family's Althorp estate in Northamptonshire, where she was buried on an island in an ornamental lake. While the precise location of her grave has never been made public, 36 oak trees have been specially planted in the estate grounds - one for each year of her life - along with hundreds of white water lilies and roses."

Photographs of the event showed celebrity friends in attendance, including singer Noel Gallagher, David Baddiel, and television presenter Jonathan Ross. Also in attendance was 30-year-old Gallacher's sister, Kirsty, and the happy couple's nine-month-old daughter Mabel. Brand reportedly hired a paddle steamer to transport guests to an India-themed reception where staff wore saris. ""They wanted a very small, personal affair with their daughter Mabel, family and close friends rather than a circus,"" a source told The Sun. It is Brand's second wedding following his marriage to singer Katy Perry between 2010 and 2012."

An emergency radio call was put out at 2.30am local time and was picked up by the ketch sailboat Dona Catharina, which happened to be carrying out whale research nearby. The ship's skipper answered the call within seven minutes. When they reached the catamaran, it was taking on water but was well aground on the reef, according to the Rescue Coordination Centre of New Zealand. After waiting a few hours until daylight, the rescue crew were able to take a dinghy to collect the family. There had been no other vessels in the vicinity. Senior search and rescue officer Geoff Lunt said the catamaran is likely to break up on the reef. He added that the family are currently ""comfortable onboard the ketch, within the safety of the lagoon"". ""We would like to thank the crew of the ketch and all the rescue services involved in tracking vessel locations and successfully rescuing this family,"" he said. The group is to sail to Niue in the next few days."

He faces eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving, four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and eight counts of causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed alcohol limit. The court heard Masierak is accused of having 55 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath - the legal driving limit is 35 microgrammes. Masierak, wearing a grey custody tracksuit, listened to proceedings via a Polish interpreter and wiped away tears with a tissue. He made no application for bail and did not indicate how he would plead to charges. Six men and two women travelling in a Ford Transit minibus died in the collision with Masierak's Scania lorry and a second lorry on the southbound carriageway near Newport Pagnell. One of the victims was the driver of the minibus, Cyriac Joseph, who was taking passengers from Nottingham to Wembley to join a tour group. A friend has paid tribute, describing him as an ""extraordinary father"". Three other victims were Karthikeyan Ramasubramaniyam Pugalur, Rishi Rajeev Kumar and Vivek Bhaskaran, who all worked for IT firm Wipro. Another Wipro employee, Mano Ranjan Panneerselvam, was critically injured. A five-year-old girl, a man and a woman remain in hospital with life-threatening injuries. Speaking outside court, Chief Inspector Henry Parsons, from Thames Valley Police, said: ""Four people who were injured remain in a serious condition in hospital. ""We have had full co-operation from the two freight companies involved and they are fully supporting us with our investigation."" David Wagstaff, the driver of the second lorry, is charged with eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving and four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

Amid fears of further clashes, the judge flew to the prison where he is being held to deliver the sentence. Security was dramatically tightened at the jail in the northern town of Rohtak. Roads were lined with barbed-wire barricades and the prison's library was turned into a makeshift courtroom. ""Shoot on sight"" orders have been put in place if anyone tries to start a protest, with curfews imposed in states where Singh has loyal support. An estimated 4,000 government troops are also patrolling the small town where the sprawling headquarters of his Dera Sacha Sauda sect are based. The 50-year-old, who is known as the ""guru in bling"", claims to have more than one million followers - and a spokeswoman for the sect has urged them to respect the court's order. His sect often campaigns in favour of vegetarianism and against drug addiction, and regularly organises blood donation and tree-planting drives. After Friday's verdict, tens of thousands of outraged supporters took to the streets, with some setting fire to government buildings and attacking police officers. In 2015, Singh had started a film franchise portraying himself as ""Messenger of God"" - performing miracles, preaching to thousands and beating up gangsters while singing and dancing. The investigation into him began back in 2002, when an anonymous letter was sent to India's prime minister. The author had accused Singh of repeatedly raping her and several other women in the sect - something he denied. It took years to trace the alleged victims, and it was not until 2007 that two women came forward and filed charges."
2017-08-28,Leading shareholders in Dixons Carphone want directors to accelerate a search for its next boss after last week's shock profit warning wiped nearly a quarter off the company's stock market value.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170828201136/http://news.sky.com/story/investors-threaten-to-hang-up-on-dixons-carphone-chief-james-11010129,"Sky News has learnt that a number of top 10 investors in the retailer will press Lord Livingston of Parkhead, Dixons Carphone's chairman, to speed up succession planning amid growing pressure on Seb James, chief executive. A search is already said to have been initiated by the board, although a person close to the company said it was simply part of ""normal succession planning"". The demand from some investors is the first sign of genuine disgruntlement ‎with the mobile phone and electrical goods chain's leadership since the £3.8bn merger of Dixons Retail and Carphone Warehouse in 2014. Mr James had run Dixons since early 2012, having joined the company in 2008. Shares in the company have lost more than half their value over the last year, a decline hastened by last week's alert that this year's profits would be as much as 30% below City forecasts. Mr James ‎blamed the downturn in trading on consumers holding on to their existing mobile handset for longer, while the post-Brexit vote fall in the value of sterling had also had an impact by forcing up the cost to British consumers of new devices. None of the shareholders who want Dixons Carphone to accelerate plans for leadership change are calling for Mr James to be sacked immediately. However, one City source ‎said on Monday that the unhappy investors believed that Mr James had ""taken his eye off the ball"" and ""lost control of the company"" in recent months. Another said he had ""not taken the necessary tough decisions"", without giving further details. Sky News revealed in July that Mr James was one of the candidates shortlisted to replace Adam Crozier as the chief executive of ITV. That role went instead to Carolyn McCall, the boss of easyJet. Some investors in Dixons Carphone believe that Mr James may have become demotivated by the expensive nature of a potentially lucrative bonus scheme which has failed to pay out because of the fall in its share price. Sources close to Dixons Carphone sprang to Mr James's defence, arguing that last week's profit warning ‎was his ""first big mistake"" as the company's boss. One insider said the board ""remains supportive of Seb and the team, and will be talking to shareholders over the coming weeks"". They added that the profitability of Dixons Carphone remained well in excess of the combined profits of the two companies prior to their merger. The views of Sir Charles Dunstone and David Ross, the Carphone Warehouse co-founders who own close to 20% of Dixons Carphone between them, were unclear ‎on Monday. The two entrepreneurs no longer have a formal involvement‎ with the business after Sir Charles stepped down as chairman this year to concentrate on his role at TalkTalk. A spokesman for the retailer, which now has a market value of just £2.1bn, declined to comment‎."

His crimes came to light after he was convicted of attempted murder in another case, which led authorities to investigate hundreds of deaths and exhume bodies of his former patients from Delmenhorst and the nearby Oldenburg hospital. Prosecutors have always believed he killed more people, putting the estimated figure at 43 in 2016. However, police now say investigators exhuming and analysing more bodies have found evidence of ""84 more murders"", which would make Hoegel one of Germany's worst ever serial killers. And the number could be even greater as some suspected victims were cremated, prosecutors say. Hoegel would inject patients with an overdose of unprescribed heart medication in order to revive them and show off his nursing skills, a court heard during his initial trial. He reportedly said he felt overjoyed when he received praise for bringing a patient back from the brink of death. Oldenburg police chief Johann Kuehme said: ""Eighty-four killings... leave us speechless. ""And as if all that were not enough, we must realise that the real dimension of the killings by Niels is likely many times worse."" Authorities are pursuing criminal cases against former staff as they believe many of the deaths could have been prevented ""if the people responsible at the time"" had been quicker to alert authorities."

The suspect drove a blue Toyota Prius ""deliberately"" at a marked patrol car before being confronted by officers. He then reached for a 4ft sword in the passenger footwell and repeatedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" - God is greatest - during a struggle with officers, police said. The suspect was detained under the Terrorism Act 2000 and a warrant for the extension of his detention has been granted. Commander Dean Haydon, of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism branch, praised the bravery and courage of the injured officers in ""quickly bringing the incident under control"". He added he was confident that it was an ""isolated incident"". Several witnesses told Sky News they saw a man being ""wrestled to the ground"", and one German tourist described hearing a ""rumble"" followed by screaming. Kiana Williamson told the Press Association: ""We turned up and there was one police van and one car, there was also a civilian's car that had veered towards the police car. ""They were trying to get the man out of the car, shouting, more police were arriving on to the scene and the man was fighting back.""

The centre has become an important hub in the Croxteth area for young people, offering them creative outlets and space to play football. ""We had fantastic support from Everton as a club. We had support from Liverpool as a club as well, and obviously the local people that go and use Rhys' community centre, they've supported it as well,"" Mr Jones said. Former Everton player and club ambassador Ian Snodin will attend the new legacy fun run on Sunday to celebrate Rhys' life. Snodin said: ""Everyone at Everton was deeply affected 10 years ago upon hearing about the passing of Rhys Jones and it's a heartbreak which is still felt by the city of Liverpool.

Dr Stephen Tait, who led the University of Glasgow research into CICD, said the new method ""often led to complete tumour regression"" and ""may be a more effective way to treat cancer"" than apoptosis. He added: ""In essence, this mechanism has the potential to dramatically improve the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapy and reduce unwanted toxicity.

While colorectal cancer cells were used by researchers, the benefits of CICD may also apply to a wide-range of cancer types. Cancer Research UK, which part-funded the research, said scientists should further research the method and develop ways to trigger it in humans.

But when it was announced last week, it sparked criticism from those who thought the role should have gone to someone with Asian background. The 34-year-old said that he had not realised the character's heritage when he accepted the part but would bow out because he felt he ""must do what I feel is right"". He wrote on Twitter: ""Last week it was announced that I would be playing Major Ben Daimio in the upcoming Hellboy reboot. ""I accepted the role unaware that the character in the original comics was of mixed Asian heritage. ""There has been intense conversation and understandable upset since that announcement, and I must do what I feel is right. ""It is clear that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people and that to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minority stories and voices in the arts. ""I feel it is important to honour and respect that. Therefore I have decided to step down so the role can be cast appropriately."" He added: ""Representation of ethnic diversity is important, especially to me as I have a mixed heritage family. ""It is our responsibility to make moral decisions in difficult times and to give voice to inclusivity. ""It is my hope that one day these discussions will become less necessary and that we can help make equal representation in the arts a reality.""

An excoriating column by Rachel Sylvester in The Times quoted diplomatic sources as saying that officials in Donald Trump's administration ""don't want to go anywhere near Boris because they think he's a joke"". An unnamed minister told the newspaper: ""It's worse in Europe. There is not a single foreign minister there who takes him seriously. They think he's a clown who can never resist a gag."" When asked about a claim in The Times that intelligence agencies were nervous about giving the Foreign Secretary sensitive material, the PM's spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""I'm not going to comment on a column in a newspaper. ""But the Prime Minister meets the Foreign Secretary regularly and they have a good relationship."" Asked if Mrs May had full confidence in Mr Johnson and thought he was doing a good job, the spokeswoman simply stated: ""Yes."" The spokeswoman was then pressed on whether she believed Mr Johnson, who has yet to comment on the claims, enjoyed the confidence of his European counterparts. She responded: ""The Prime Minister has a good relationship with Boris Johnson, has full confidence in him and he's doing a good job."" Michael Fuchs, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, was asked about the much-commented column in an interview with the BBC's World at One. The deputy parliamentary leader of Mrs Merkel's CDU party suggested Mr Johnson has calmed down in recent weeks. Dr Fuchs said: ""It was not very clever from him, the way he handled Europe or European negotiators at the beginning, but I have a feeling that in the last couple of weeks he was rather calm, we didn't hear much from him so maybe he thought it over and he has to come back to the negotiating table, because it's a very difficult process and big words don't help."""
2017-08-29,"With the constant blizzard of emails, text messages and cold calls from the claims management companies, not to mention the barrage of television and newspaper advertising they generate, it seems scarcely believable that there is a soul in the land who has not heard of the Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170829155625/http://news.sky.com/story/ppi-the-winners-and-losers-in-the-uks-largest-mis-selling-scandal-11011373,"According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), however, many millions of Britons may still be unaware that they are entitled to compensation for being mis-sold PPI. That is why the UK's leading financial regulator has today launched a £42m campaign, fronted by Arnold Schwarzenegger, aimed at ""cutting through the noise"", in its words. To date, some £27.4bn has been paid by the banks and building societies in compensation to those who were mis-sold the policies, which were mass-marketed largely between 1990 and 2010. That sounds a lot - but, the regulator says, only covers fewer than half of the 60 million or so policies that were sold alongside bank loans, mortgages, credit cards and store cards. Should the FCA's campaign succeed, the banks will face an avalanche of further compensation claims. They have so far set aside some £37bn or so to cover pay-outs, so potentially could be facing higher costs. However, to accompany this campaign, the FCA has also announced a deadline in which those mis-sold have in which to launch a claim for compensation. This is something that the banks have been urging for a while. They have argued that, by the time the deadline comes into force on 29 August 2019, those claiming to have been mis-sold products will have had more than eight years in which to request compensation. The deadline has angered the claims management firms that have grown rich on the PPI mis-selling scandal. One of them has even launched a legal challenge to the FCA's decision to impose a deadline. Many Britons, heartily tired of the claims firms, will welcome it. The trouble is that these firms are unlikely to pack up and go away. They are likely to alight on another cause from which they can make a profit. One of the burgeoning areas, mined profitably by companies who in the last decade made a decent living from promoting whiplash claims, is encouraging customers of tour operators to claim that they fell ill on their package holiday. One of the lasting legacies of the PPI scandal, and not for the better, is the way it has fostered and accelerated the growth of a US-style compensation culture in Britain. Yet there are also some positives. One is that the banks have been chastened. The sheer scale of the pay-outs they have had to make has made all of them think carefully about how they sell products to, and interact with, their customers. And perhaps the biggest positive of all is that, since 2011, PPI pay-outs have succeeded in putting money in the pockets of ordinary Britons during a period in which, for the most part, average earnings have failed to grow at the same pace as the cost of living. It's why it has been referred to as 'people's quantitative easing'. If the FCA campaign succeeds, the pay-outs will be rolling in for some time to come."

Irritation was initially reported by tourists visiting the clifftops and beach at Birling Gap near Eastbourne just before 5pm. The effects of the haze were also reported as far as Bexhill and towards Hastings, more than 20 miles away. Mark Battershill, who was one of those affected, told Sky News he was left with stinging eyes and a sore throat after coming into contact with the mystery chemical. He said some people had complained that they were having difficulty breathing. Conditions are being monitored at Birling Gap, a popular tourist hotspot, throughout Bank Holiday Monday."
2017-08-29,Sky Ocean Rescue's plastic whale has returned home after a nationwide tour to highlight the problem with single-use plastic.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170829155625/http://news.sky.com/story/sky-ocean-rescue-plasticus-whale-completes-national-campaign-tour-11011242,"The 10ft whale is made up of a quarter of a ton of plastic to represent the amount that enters the world's oceans every second. As part of the tour of 12 locations across Britain, it has been named Plasticus following a vote by members of the public. Recycle Michael and Whaley McWhaleface - a reference to the infamous boat-naming competition in 2016 that went awry - were among the other suggestions. :: How you can help cut plastic out of your life Sky's chief executive Jeremy Darroch said the name Plasticus ""captures the idea of a fight"" against plastic pollution in our oceans. He said: ""We have got to do something to improve and reduce the number of plastics that are flowing into our oceans and damaging marine life, affecting our coastline. That's what this campaign's all about."" Mr Darroch said the reaction from the more than half a million people who joined Plasticus' two-week tour had been ""overwhelming"". :: Plastic haunting us on adventure to save ocean He added: ""In naming the whale Plasticus, the public have brought to life the fight against plastics in the ocean - a fight we must all join and will continue to champion through our campaign."" The whale is made from single-use plastic recovered from the ocean and beach cleans. It will now rest at the recycling plant of material management company Bywaters, which made Plasticus. The firm's head of sustainability, Edward van Reenen, said the easiest way for consumers to reduce their use of single-use plastic was to cut down on plastic bottles. :: Pollution 'washing in on every tide' ""Using a water bottle for life is a nice, easy way people can reduce the amount of plastic they're consuming,"" he told Sky News. Mr Van Reenen added that coupling such a change with buying 'bags for life' rather than plastic carriers makes a ""big impact when you scale that up across a whole society"". :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"
2017-08-29,Corporate governance doesn't sound sexy. It doesn't even sound very interesting. But in the heady days of Theresa May's ascension to the premiership it came to epitomise the change of gear between her and David Cameron.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170829155625/http://news.sky.com/story/boardroom-pay-reforms-show-mays-domestic-agenda-has-withered-away-11011214,"Mrs May - and her then-chief policy adviser Nick Timothy - thought that the Brexit referendum result was about more than the EU or immigration or sovereignty. It was a ""cri de coeur"" from ordinary voters that the model of the British economy was broken, rigged in favour of big business and a corporate boss class who seemed to take all the rewards when things were good and pay little penalty when things went bad. In this she started to sound a little like Ed Miliband or Teddy Roosevelt or Joseph Chamberlain, a radical Liberal turned Conservative from the late 19th century and a hero of Mr Timothy. Mr Chamberlain was someone who was unafraid to use the power of the state to interfere in markets when required for the public good. So for instance as mayor of Birmingham he took local gas and water companies into public ownership (effectively local nationalisation). He was supposed to be the PM's new inspiration. This was a far cry from the diet of unalloyed free-market Thatcherism from which the Tory party had fed since the mid-1970s. You certainly couldn't have imagined the words of our second female prime minister coming out of the mouth of our first: ""I want to see changes in the way that big business is governed. The people who run big businesses are supposed to be accountable to outsiders, to non-executive directors, who are supposed to ask the difficult questions, think about the long-term and defend the interests of shareholders. ""In practice, they are drawn from the same, narrow social and professional circles as the executive team and - as we have seen time and time again - the scrutiny they provide is just not good enough. ""So if I'm Prime Minister, we're going to change that system - and we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well."" She went on to make a second, some would say anti-business pledge: ""We're the Conservative Party, and yes we're the party of enterprise, but that does not mean we should be prepared to accept that anything goes … So as part of the changes I want to make to corporate governance, I want to make shareholder votes on corporate pay not just advisory but binding."" This pledge was also included in the Conservative 2017 election manifesto. Together she said these two changes would help create ""a different kind of Conservatism … a break with the past."" This would be a different Tory party and a different Britain too. We now know that both of these reforms, which would have been a major transformation to the way British capitalism is governed, will not be included in the Government's proposals to be brought forward today. There will be some change. For example, firms will have to publish the ratios of the difference between their highest paid and lowest. But they are a far cry from the root and branch reform Mrs May had said was her ambition only a year ago. In that speech she also spoke of the importance of the creation of new grammar schools. That is also dead. The domestic agenda of Mrs May seems to have almost entirely withered away. Perhaps that is not surprising given the disastrous election result. She doubtless didn't wish to risk defeat in the Commons if some of her Thatcherite backbenchers rebelled. Or worse could only get the measures through on Labour votes. Thus alongside the unravelling of Mrs May's domestic agenda this saga also throws up one of the deep paradoxes of Brexit. Let's assume the PM was sincere in her wish to reform British capitalism, and I think she probably was. Had she come to office in different circumstances, without the Brexit behemoth looming large, she would have perhaps felt able to flex her muscles and be tougher on business. But with economic numbers going south and the lack of progress on a trade deal worrying UK plc she probably felt unable to announce anything which business would consider a disincentive to invest in the UK. Moreover if we also accept that the May analysis was right, that the vote was a wail of anger, a plea for governments to tame the power of massive companies and protect us against the rougher edges of globalisation and corporate greed, then it is a deep irony that the Brexit process seems to be making it harder for Britain to do much about it. And if no deal is reached, that paradox may get all the more acute. One option long discussed in Whitehall (and the veiled threat Chancellor Philip Hammond made earlier in the year) has been to pull the only other lever Britain might have in its arsenal if a deal is not forthcoming: to become a low-corporate tax (perhaps even tax haven) off the coast of Europe. Slash business taxes, liberalise labour law, reduce regulation: the Singapore option, one where, in the PM's words, in business ""anything goes."" I wonder if this is what many voters would have had in mind when they put their cross in the box and voted to ""take control"". Mrs May was asked during the election what Mayism was. She denied such a thing existed saying there was only Conservatism. But that was misleading. She had begun to sketch out what Mayism was. It would have been different to Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron. But Brexit and the General Election have both come together to reset the Conservative party back to its default setting. Mr Chamberlain, surely, would not have approved."

Detectives from the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command are now reinvestigating the case, which was initially led by the force's special branch detectives. They believe allegiances may have shifted in the years that have passed, and witnesses who were not willing to speak at the time may be willing to come forward and could have crucial information.. Mr Al-Ali, a Palestinian who worked for Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas, often drew criticism for his cartoons, which were sometimes perceived as critical of the regime in Palestine. He had received a number of death threats in the years leading up to his murder The 51-year-old was walking to his work building in Ives Street after parking his car nearby when he was shot. Witnesses described seeing a man holding a black automatic handgun who ran away after the attack. One reported seeing another man crossing Fulham Road into Lucan Place and getting into the driver's seat of a silver-grey left-hand drive Mercedes shortly after the shooting. The gun - a 7.62 Tokarev pistol - was found in open space on the Hallfield Estate in Paddington two years after the murder. Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Met's counter-terrorism command, said: ""The brutal murder of Mr Al-Ali devastated his family and 30 years on they continue to feel the loss. ""We have previously reviewed this case and followed a number of lines of inquiry which have not resulted in us identifying these two men. ""However, a lot can change in 30 years - allegiances shift and people who were not willing to speak at the time of the murder may now be prepared to come forward with crucial information."" :: Anyone with information is urged to call the investigation team, quoting Operation Amazon, on 020 3276 9014, or 0044 203 276 9014 from outside the UK.

According to The Times, the English-speaking girl was left confused and upset by the foster family's use of Arabic. The newspaper also reported that her necklace, which had a cross, was allegedly removed by the carers - and they had refused to allow the girl to eat spaghetti carbonara because it contained bacon. In a statement, Ms Longfield said: ""A child's religious, racial and cultural background should be taken into consideration when they are placed with foster carers."" A social services supervisor in the east London borough had claimed the child had sobbed and begged not to be returned to the foster family because of the language divide. One MP, Andrew Bridgen, said: ""It is a reflection of the meltdown in children's services in Tower Hamlets following a local government regime that was racked with corruption and incompetence. ""This is the fallout when public services are being delivered so badly in this way. It is people like this vulnerable five-year-old girl who are at the sharp end of this. ""It's not acceptable and the Government needs to intervene."" Robert Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Committee, told The Times that an investigation was needed to determine whether this case was a one-off. He said: ""I'd be equally concerned if a Muslim child who didn't speak English was placed with a Christian foster carer whose family didn't speak the child's language and at times appeared to show little regard for his cultural heritage."" A spokesman for the council told the newspaper that its fostering service ""provides a loving, stable home for hundreds of children every year"" - adding ""absolute consideration"" is given to each child's background and cultural identity."
2017-08-29,"At street level, there's nothing special about this road in south-west London. But take a journey 33 metres underground, and you'll see something quite remarkable.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170829155625/http://news.sky.com/story/futuristic-farms-to-fight-possible-post-brexit-food-supply-problem-11010858,"Since 2015, farming company Growing Underground has been growing micro-herbs, including pea-shoots and mustard leaves, in a disused World War II air-raid shelter. The farm, founded by Steven Dring and Richard Ballard, occupies nearly 1.2 miles of tunnels, which the duo lease from the capital's Transport for London agency. Mr Dring told Sky News: ""We wanted to build something that is grown close to where it is consumed. ""Someone has basically built a big poly-tunnel for us here so all we had to do was add the lights and the LEDs."" Mr Dring and Mr Ballard had originally looked in office buildings for their urban farm. But the tunnels provided a cheap, city-central location which, after six months of refurbishment, now provide an ideal growing environment. The micro-herbs are grown using a hydroponic system that doesn't use soil. The result is a micro-green that's more consistent in shape and quality than its above-ground cousin. They can also be grown year-round. Mr Dring said: ""One of the benefits of being down here is that we are not affected by adverse weather or the winter months, so we get a lot more crops by growing in a controlled environment like this. ""I think we need to look at innovative ways and embracing agricultural technology and technology to help produce more food locally and in the UK."" This continuity of supply, as well as their geographical proximity to clients, have given this small farm a competitive edge. For the past year they have provided their greens to top London restaurants and food markets and they have just signed a new contract with a major high street retailer. Growing Underground's success comes at a time when many other small, British farms are struggling. Figures from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board indicate more than 1,000 small British farms have closed since 2013. This led some food policy experts to warn of a looming crisis in the UK's food supply, especially with post-Brexit trade deals yet to be agreed upon. A new report by from the University of Sussex warned the government is ""sleepwalking"" into a post-Brexit future where food supply could be insecure, expensive and unsafe. ""The UK's home production has been steadily declining,"" the report's author Tim Lang wrote. ""It's like the rabbit caught in the headlights with no goals, no leadership, and eviscerated key ministries."" Around one-third of the UK's food is imported from the European Union and it's from the EU that the UK derives its food policies, such as food and farming production standards. But Ben Reynolds, from food lobby group Sustain, said Brexit discussions could herald a new beginning for the UK's own food policies - if the right decisions are made. ""Government really needs to step up now,"" Mr Reynolds told Sky News. ""We have this opportunity with Brexit, they have the responsibility. ""They can't blame Europe, it's going to be their responsibility. ""They need to sort it out in order to protect British farmers' livelihoods and make sure consumers get good quality food."""

The 52-year-old, who owned minibus firm ABC Travels, was taking the group from Nottingham to Wembley Stadium to join a tour group for Europe when the crash happened. His friend Manu Zachariah paid tribute to a dedicated father who loved his family and friends. ""Cyriac was not like normal fathers,"" he said. ""He would love to spend his money and time on his children like none of his friends. ""He was always very encouraging of their extracurricular activities.

Mr Zachariah said he believed Mr Joseph and his family moved to the UK about 15 years ago. He said Mr Joseph started his minibus business around four years ago and made mostly airport trips and similar journeys. ""He was a very close friend of mine and we used to work together,"" he said. ""It is very shocking and we don't want to believe that he is not alive... he was part of every part of our lives. ""It is a big loss to the community.""

But Kenya's environment minister Judy Wakhungu insisted manufacturers would be predominantly targeted first. ""Ordinary wananchi will not be harmed,"" she said, using a Kiswahili word for ""common man"". The East African nation joins more than 40 other countries that have banned, partly banned or taxed single-use plastic bags, including China, France, Rwanda, and Italy. Many bags drift into the ocean, strangling turtles, suffocating seabirds and filling the stomachs of dolphins and whales with waste until they die of starvation. Pastic bags can take between 500 and 1,000 years to break down. ""If we continue like this, by 2050, we will have more plastic in the ocean than fish,"" said Habib El-Habr, an expert on marine litter working with the UN Environment Programme in Kenya. But not everyone in Kenya is a fan of the ban. The country's Association of Manufacturers said it would cost 60,000 jobs and force 176 manufacturers to close. ""The knock-on effects will be very severe,"" a spokesman said. ""It will even affect the women who sell vegetables in the market - how will their customers carry their shopping home?"" Kenya is a major exporter of plastic bags in Africa, but big supermarket chains have started offering customers cloth bags as an alternative. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"

After an investigation, the broadcasting regulator concluded the content of his show was ""unsuitable for a time when children were likely to be listening"". Brand's show on Radio X is normally broadcast live, and he had only started presenting in that slot a month earlier. Nine years ago, the star resigned from his Radio 2 programme after a controversial prank on Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs. Brand and Jonathan Ross infamously left ""gratuitously offensive, humiliating and demeaning"" messages on the actor's voicemail, and the BBC was fined £150,000. During the Radio X incident, Brand asked the Elvis impersonator: ""Have you ever had sex as Elvis? You 'ave ain't yer?"" The guest replied: ""I've done it without the jumpsuit, but I have kept the cape on. ""The only difficulty with that (the jumpsuit) is they're studded, you see, and they get very spiky and so they can cut you in places that you wouldn't imagine... And if you're on top of somebody..."" Brand then exclaimed: ""You're a bit of a brutal lover there!"" The 42-year-old's co-host, Matt Morgan, later joked: ""You showed yourself up, as you always do… sexualising everything."" A discussion about prostitution was later aired. Global, which owns Radio X, described the comments as a ""fleeting moment"" and said the station was targeted towards an ""alternative"" audience.

2017-08-29,"Princess Diana, her boyfriend Dodi al Fayed and their driver all lost their lives after the car they were travelling in crashed in Paris.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170829155625/http://news.sky.com/story/trevor-rees-jones-what-happened-to-the-sole-survivor-of-dianas-crash-11005463,"Only one person inside the Mercedes survived: Trevor Rees-Jones. He was Mr al Fayed's bodyguard and was sat in the front seat at the time of the devastating collision in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel early on 31 August 1997. No one inside the car had been wearing seatbelts, with Mr al Fayed and driver Henri Paul declared dead at the scene. But when emergency workers arrived at the wreckage, they discovered that Diana and Mr Rees-Jones were alive - albeit with serious injuries. They would both be taken to Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital - and Princess Diana, who arrived for emergency treatment first, would be pronounced dead within hours. Although Mr Rees-Jones was conscious, he was trapped inside the wreckage and was suffering from severe facial trauma. The roof of the Mercedes had to be cut away by firefighters before he too could be taken to hospital. Mr Rees-Jones was sedated for almost two weeks after the crash, and suffered amnesia for many months afterwards. In the mid-2000s, expert witnesses told a Metropolitan Police investigation that Mr Rees-Jones had a ""very limited recall"" of what happened immediately before and after the crash - and this was unlikely to ever change. Dr Maurice Lipsedge, a psychiatrist, had said: ""Trevor Rees-Jones remembers getting into the Mercedes in the Rue Cambon and the car driving off, he remembers nothing after that. ""A few snatches might come back to him but his memories are not at all reliable because even for him it is impossible to tell if these are genuine memories or reconstructions of events from information he might have had later, dreams or imagination."" The conclusion that Mr Rees-Jones had suffered memory loss was challenged by Mohamed al Fayed - Dodi's father. The elder al Fayed had claimed the bodyguard ""knew exactly what happened"" before the Mercedes entered the tunnel, as well as details the security services were eager to suppress. Although Mr Rees-Jones was eager to return to work, he resigned from his job with Mr al Fayed in April 1998 on the advice of his solicitors. The bodyguard later claimed he had felt pressured by the business magnate to remember what had happened. In 2000, Mr Rees-Jones published his memoirs entitled The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, The Crash And The Sole Survivor. Mr al Fayed further alleged that this book was a ""tissue of lies"" and had actually been written by the security services in an attempt to support the British authorities' conclusion that Diana and Dodi had died in a ""simple traffic accident"". Operation Paget, the police inquiry set up in 2004 to investigate conspiracy theories surrounding Diana's death, concluded there was no evidence that Mr Rees-Jones remembered the crash - nor was there evidence that the security services were involved in the production of his book. Mr al Fayed had also claimed that the bodyguard had been given a senior job in United Nations security as ""an inducement to ensure his continued silence"" - another claim dismissed by Operation Paget. Mr Rees-Jones has given very few interviews in the years since the crash, keeping out of the public eye. According to The Sun, he now lives in Shropshire after holding several roles abroad - with friends telling the newspaper he had ""done really well for himself"" by working in Texas as a security director for the American oil company Halliburton."

Half a million people are expected to need emergency help, with the worst of the weather yet to recede. On the eve of his planned trip to the disaster zone with First Lady Melania Trump on Tuesday, the US President said: ""It's the biggest ever, they are saying it is the biggest, it's historic. ""It is a historic amount of water, there's never been anything like it."" The storm is set to bring more downpours to Houston, the state's biggest city, with the life-threatening flooding predicted to peak on Wednesday and Thursday. Up to 20 more inches of rain could fall in the coming days, on top of the 30 inches some areas have experienced so far. More than 75,000 emergency calls have been processed by Houston's services since Harvey first hit the city. At least 2,000 people have been rescued so far as a result of the storm, with 12,000 troops deployed to assist with search and rescue efforts. Mr Trump said he would speak to the US Congress about boosting emergency funds. ""We're dealing with Congress. As you know it's going to be a very expensive situation,"" he said. ""We want to take care of the people of Texas and Louisiana when that happens - we'll see what happens with the flow, the flow seems to be heading towards Louisiana right now, as we speak - we'll be there for the people of Louisiana also."" He added that recovery from the storm's damage would be a ""long and difficult road"". Texas governor Greg Abbott described Harvey as ""if not the largest, one of the largest disasters America has ever faced"". He said the state was ""just beginning the process of responding to this storm"", with authorities prioritising ""protecting and preserving life and rescuing every person we can find"". State officials have said at least eight people appear to have died as a result of Harvey. Mr Abbott added his second goal was to ensure access to necessities such as food, water and power, with electricity in the process of being restored in areas that most desperately need it. He said there was a ""need to recognise...a new and different normal for this entire region"" in the wake of the storm's devastation. Eighteen of Texas's 254 counties have qualified for federal help due to the disaster, triggering aid from Washington's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The White House insisted FEMA's $3bn balance would be enough to handle the immediate response to the storm, with the agency now prioritising its response to Harvey over earlier disasters in order to prevent it running out of money. Mr Trump vowed federal cash would arrive in the region quickly. ""You're going to have what you need and it's going to go fast,"" he said. When US Congress returns next week, it is likely to vote on a multibillion-dollar aid package. A spokeswoman for House of Representatives speaker Paul Ryan said: ""We will help those affected by this terrible disaster. ""The first step in that process is a formal request for resources from the administration."" Mexico, which Mr Trump has continued to insist will pay for a border wall ""one way or the other"", has offered assistance with the disaster."
2017-08-29,Commuters have vented their anger after disruption at London's Waterloo station and on the South Western network continued - despite the scheduled end to improvement works.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170829155625/http://news.sky.com/story/waterloo-disruption-angers-commuters-as-upgrade-works-overrun-11011601,"A month-long £800m overhaul to increase capacity at the UK's busiest station was meant to be complete but travellers reported delays and cancellations in the morning rush hour. Jasper Johns said his journey from Kingston was delayed by about 40 minutes. The 35-year-old, who has been commuting to Waterloo while the works have been going on, said: ""I've actually found going in OK, but coming out is an absolute shambles."" Another commuter, Dave Vasse, tweeted: ""Predictable & embarrassing that Waterloo should be a mess today after 8 months of advertising 28th completion date."" A 24-year-old tutor trying to get to New Malden in Surrey said: ""My train was delayed - very delayed and then it was cancelled. ""It's annoying. I was told all the work would be finished by yesterday evening but it's been delayed again and again. It's really frustrating."" South Western train passengers were told by email that services on the operator's entire network might be cancelled, delayed or changed, with disruption expected until 4pm. Stations including Queenstown Road, Earlsfield and Norbiton were closed. Network Rail boss Mark Carne, speaking in a video message, said Waterloo had reopened ""a little later than planned"" after a signalling problem closed platforms during the morning rush hour. He said the project would make a ""huge difference"" and increase capacity by 30% in the long run - meaning space for an extra 45,000 commuters in the morning and evening peaks. A statement added: ""Network Rail apologises to passengers for any delays to their journey and asks them to check before they travel this morning."" Mark Carne, chief executive of @NetworkRail, comments on the reopening of @LondonWaterloo. #WaterlooUpgrade pic.twitter.com/kwmSuElG0u A team of 1,000 worked 24 hours a day for three and a half weeks to get the work done, according to Network Rail, with platforms 1 to 4 extended by 44m so they can take 10-carriage trains. Safety and signalling across all platforms also had to be upgraded and tested. The five former Eurostar platforms at the station will now be redeveloped to bring them permanently back into service by the end of next year. Network Rail route managing director Becky Lumlock reassured passengers the work would happen ""behind the scenes"". Anthony Smith, head of the watchdog Transport Focus, said it was disappointing that the end to the upgrade works had slipped, despite promises from rail bosses. Mr Smith said lessons must be ""learnt and built into future events"". ""In the meantime, every single passenger affected should claim compensation. Send a clear message to the industry and make sure your voice is heard,"" he added."
2017-08-29,Arnold Schwarzenegger is fronting a campaign warning consumers they only have two years to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170829155625/http://news.sky.com/story/arnold-schwarzenegger-back-as-the-face-of-ppi-claims-deadline-11011088,"An animatronic model of The Terminator star and former governor of California's head features in the awareness adverts - paid for by the financial services firms with the worst complaint record for PPI. In the commercials, Arnie shouts ""come on"" and ""bye byes to the PPI"" as he urges shoppers to make a decision on claiming compensation. The £42m campaign is the brainchild of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which believes the sector's biggest mis-selling scandal is far from over as the clock ticks down to the 29 August 2019 deadline for claims. Updated figures from the City watchdog would, on the face of it, suggest it has a point. There were 64 million PPI policies sold by the likes of credit card and mortgage providers. There have been 12 million successful claims to date against PPI - an insurance product which was aimed at covering bills in the event of the policyholder losing their job or being off sick. Up to four million have been rejected. Banks and other providers have set aside £37bn to cover the cost of investigation and compensation with £27bn has been paid out so far. FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said: ""Our campaign aims to cut through the noise on PPI. ""We want to encourage people to decide whether to find out if they had PPI and whether to complain or not. ""Our message, and Arnie's, is 'do it now' and I urge people to make a decision before the deadline on 29 August 2019."" The FCA used the launch of the awareness campaign to announce that customers could be entitled to compensation even if they were not mis-sold. It said if someone had complained about PPI previously, and had the complaint rejected, they may be entitled to compensation if the provider earned a high level of commission from selling PPI. The watchdog said it had also established a new dedicated phone line designed to assist customers with their PPI queries - with full information on how best to claim available on its website. Regulators and consumer groups have urged people to complain directly amid a crackdown on the activities of claims management firms - an industry largely born from the PPI scandal - with gripes ranging from cold-calling to high fees."

South Korea's military said the missile travelled 1,678 miles and was fired from North Korea's Sunan region, near the capital Pyongyang, just before 6am local time. But Japan's military did not attempt to shoot down the missile, which broke into three pieces and fell into the sea east of Hokkaido. There was no damage reported and the Pentagon said the missile posed no threat to US territory. Earlier in August, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had threatened to fire missiles at the US Pacific territory of Guam. US President Donald Trump had promised ""fire and fury"" for North Korea if it threatened the US. Tensions appeared to have eased in recent weeks, although North Korea has previously reacted angrily to US/South Korean military drills, such as the ones currently underway, which it describes as an invasion rehearsal. Following Tuesday's missile launch, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country's authorities would ""gather information and analyse"" the situation, adding: ""We'll take all possible measures to ensure people's safety"". Foreign affairs expert Tim Marshall told Sky News that the move by the North Koreans was ""massively provocative"" but added that we ""may not be at the brink"". He said: ""Crucially, the missile fell hundreds of miles outside Hokkaido and hundreds of miles from Guam. ""What this means is that the Americans can say it's not a threat, the Japanese patriot missile system...did not need to be fired and the North Korean leadership knew this, so they've made this massive gamble. ""It's the first time in years that they've fired a missile over Japan, everyone's gone into emergency mode, quite understandable, but at the moment the signals are this is still not going over the brink. ""But it's pretty close to it and when you get close to the brink, things can happen that you haven't planned for."" Mr Marshall added: ""If this had been close to Guam, I think it could have triggered a war; if it had been so close to Hokkaido that the patriot missile system had to shoot it down then that might have triggered a war. ""That's why it is a calculated gamble from the North Koreans...it allowed some wiggle room."""

Jack O'Brien, 22, denies attempting to rob the 28-year-old on 2 November 2016. Carroll's 999 call was played to the jury, in which he was heard saying: ""There's two motorbikes, one's behind me pulling out a gun, I don't know what to do."" Beeping is heard in the background, and Carroll tells the call handler: ""Oh s***, I've hit loads of cars, I don't know what to do, he's just hit my car."" Prosecutor Simon Gladwell told the court that two bikers chased Carroll after one approached him at a set of traffic lights in Hainault, northeast London, and demanded his £22,000 watch. Carroll told the jury: ""I just pulled up at the traffic lights, my window was open, a bike pulled up next to me and said 'Nice watch'."" He said he replied ""thanks"" and told the court he thought he recognised the biker. ""He had his crash helmet on with his visor up,"" said Carroll. ""I stared at him for about 10 seconds as I thought I recognised him and thought he was going to have a conversation. I went to drive away and he said 'Give me your watch'."" He said to start with he ""didn't know if it was a joke"" but, when he did a U-turn, both bikes turned and followed him. He eventually arrived back at the training ground and told the 999 operator there were security staff there. At one point he tells the call handler: ""I'm a Premier League footballer."" ""I've probably just hit about 10 cars on the way here,"" he said. Michael Edmonds, defending, said O'Brien, of Navarre Gardens, Romford, east London, was not the motorbike rider. He said O'Brien had used the bike, jacket and helmet for crime before, but that it was not him using the motorbike on this occasion. The trial continues and is expected to last three days."

It cited several likely factors for the drop - top of these being the Brexit-linked cooling in the UK economy witnessed this year. The lender said demand for properties remained subdued given the squeeze on household budgets - a consequence of higher inflation outstripping wage growth. At the same time, a softening in mortgage approvals could reflect pressure on mortgage providers not to repeat past mistakes by allowing buyers to borrow more than they can handle. Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, said: ""In some respects the slowdown in the housing market is surprising, given the ongoing strength of the labour market. ""The economy created a healthy 125,000 jobs in the three months to June and the unemployment rate fell to 4.4% - the lowest rate for over forty years. In addition, mortgage rates have remained close to all-time lows. ""It may be that mounting pressure on household finances is exerting a drag."" He added: ""While measures of housing affordability are not particularly stretched at a UK level, pressures are evident in some regions - especially London and the South of England."" Nationwide forecast annual growth of 2% for the market this year with constrained supply supporting prices. It said the stock of homes on estate agents' books remained close to 30-year lows while the number of new homes coming onto the market remained subdued."

Mr Clark is to say today that the reforms will ""ensure our largest companies are more transparent and accountable to their employees and shareholders"". But Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the proposals were ""just more crony capitalism from the Tories, who once again prop up the rigged system for the few at the expense of the many"". Liberal Democrat leader and former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said the approach was ""strong on rhetoric, weak on action"". He said that the new corporate governance code for large private companies was ""voluntary and, therefore, likely to have little effect"". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady described the proposal as ""feeble"", saying it was ""spelling business as usual for boardrooms across Britain"". She added: ""The Prime Minister's pledge to put workers on company boards has been watered down beyond all recognition."" Big business was mostly welcoming of the plans, however. CBI president Paul Drechsler said pay ratios ""could prove a useful addition to the debate about executive pay"". He added: ""Providing shareholders with a 'say on pay' has been an effective tool and a public register will help to shine a light on the small minority of cases that warrant greater attention."" Director general of the Institute of Directors Stephen Martin added: ""Pay ratios will sharpen the awareness of boards on the issue of remuneration, but they can be a crude measure. ""Companies will have to prepare themselves to explain how pay as a whole in their business operates, and why executives are worth their packages."" The proposals include giving employees a voice in the boardroom. Listed companies where a significant number of shareholders are opposed to the executive pay packages would also have their names on a public register."
2017-08-29,Sky News has obtained covert surveillance photographs that appear to be further proof Russian intelligence was behind last year's attempt to assassinate a European Prime Minister.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170829155625/http://news.sky.com/story/photos-prove-russia-behind-montenegro-assassination-plot-11010838,"The images were taken as part of an undercover operation in the days following the unsuccessful coup in Montenegro. The photos, taken in neighbouring Serbia by an unnamed European security service, show two Russians accused of plotting the coup - Eduard Shishmakov and Vladimir Popov. Both men are said to be members of the GRU, Russian military intelligence. In one, Shishmakov is pictured meeting with a Serb, Alexsandar Sindjelic. Sindjelic was subsequently arrested and he has reportedly confessed his involvement in the attempted coup and admitted working as an agent for the two Russians. In another photo, Shishmakov and Popov are photographed together on a bench believed to be in a park in central Belgrade. The photos were taken around the time of the attempted coup. The coup was planned for the evening of 16 October last year - the day of parliamentary elections. The plan was to infiltrate a pro-Russian rally outside the Parliament building in the Montenegrin capital Podgorica. Plotters, dressed as policemen, would break into Parliament and turn their fire on the protesters, thus making it look like the Montenegrin state security had shot its own people. Separately, the pro-European Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic would be assassinated in the hope of a pro-Russian politician seizing power. The plot was foiled with hours to spare. Security sources claim these photographs are further evidence that the Russian state was directly linked with the attempted coup and show blatant aggression in a European country. Moscow has always denied any involvement - the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed the connection as ""absurd"". Politically, Russia has long been opposed to Montenegro's ambitions to join NATO and the country was formally admitted into the military alliance in recent months. The Balkan country sits in Moscow's sphere of interest and large numbers of Russian tourists visit each summer. Montenegro is politically split. Much of the population is in favour of closer ties with Europe but a sizeable and significant proportion would rather stay close to Moscow. The coup attempt went largely unnoticed at the time - partly because of the US presidential elections - but has attracted increased interest across Europe as further details have come to light. Earlier this year Sky News published images of a passport belonging to Eduard Shishmakov. He is described as an assistant military attaché to the Russian Embassy in Warsaw. Security sources say this is a commonly used alias for GRU officers. Additionally, Polish intelligence provided a statement saying they expelled Shishmakov from Poland for espionage activities and declared him persona non grata. The two Russians are believed to be back in Russia. They are therefore being tried 'in absentia' alongside 13 other defendants, including two Montenegrin opposition MPs and 10 Serbians. They have been charged with a range of offences. Earlier this year the Montenegrin Chief Special Prosecutor, Milivoje Katnic, told state television that they ""now have evidence that nationalist structures from Russia are behind the coup attempt, but also that certain state bodies of Russia are involved, on a certain level"". The trial will be the largest in Montenegrin history and highly political. It is also believed to be the first time serving GRU officers have been charged with terrorism offences and criminal activity in a European country. It briefly opened last month but was adjourned to give the defence more time. It is expected to resume next Monday. The Montenegrin prosecutor is expected to produce evidence showing the Russians' phones were adapted with software to allow covert messaging. He will also allege financial transactions linking the Russians with Sindjelic."

Around half-a-mile away from the tower, firefighters lined up, removed their helmets and bowed their heads outside North Kensington fire station. Following the minute's silence, the firefighters were embraced and thanked by carnival-goers, many of whom posed for photos with them. Emma Dent Coad, MP for Kensington, wiped away tears after the moment of reflection. She said: ""It's a really, really lovely atmosphere, there's gorgeous weather, there's a lot of good feeling out there."" The MP added she would be keeping the Grenfell disaster ""very high on the agenda"". ""I won't rest until every single family is properly housed, and despite my efforts over the last 10 weeks I've got nowhere at all and I find that very, very, very difficult,"" she said. ""I did imagine as an MP I'd be able to help people get things done, but it's been very hard."" On Sunday, dozens of white doves were released at the carnival's opening ceremony as a ""small act of remembrance"" for Grenfell victims. The birds were released from the hands of survivors and local residents, as well as leader of Kensington and Chelsea council Elizabeth Campbell, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Ms Dent Coad. A number of festival-goers wore green in a show of ""reverence and respect"" to victims, while others held aloft signs and banners in tribute. Clarrie Mendy, a relative of victims Khadija Saye and Mary Mendy, said she felt the event had been a healing experience for those grieving. She said: ""A lot of people are finding their voice and saying this is the first time since it happened they've actually found a voice to speak. ""I think they know they're not alone. They see other people suffering the same plight, they know there's a collective."""

The 30-year-old's high-speed journey was captured on police dash cams and by a West Midlands Police helicopter, before ending when he hit a traffic island and smashed into a car at a petrol station in Castle Bromwich. After crashing his £85,000 BMW M3, Farooq climbed into the back seat with two other passengers and claimed not to have been the driver. Last week, a jury at Birmingham Crown Court found him guilty of dangerous driving and driving while disqualified. CCTV from earlier in the evening showed the BMW's driver wearing clothes that matched his. Farooq, who was already banned from driving for speeding off from a police traffic stop last year, was jailed for two-and-a-half years. He was also banned from driving for 10 years. PC Robert Lattimer, from West Midlands Police's roads policing unit, said: ""This was reckless driving by someone who should not have been behind the wheel. ""Officers had suspicions around the vehicle and tried to pull it over; but Farooq failed to stop and hit speeds of 115mph in 30mph zones. ""He tried to deny being the driver despite our investigations which secured such strong evidence against him. ""This was a high performance vehicle and the outcome could have been much worse."""

The West London palace was Diana's home until she died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in Paris. It became a focus for thousands of mourners who came to leave flowers and remember her.

Sky's Scotland Correspondent James Matthews, who broke the news, said: ""I think she's simply had enough on a number of levels in a very difficult job."" It is believed that Scottish Labour members were told on Tuesday. In her resignation letter to the chair of the Scottish Labour Party, Ms Dugdale writes: ""I've given this task all that I have. ""With nearly four years until the next Scottish Parliament election, I'm convinced the party needs a new leader with fresh energy, drive and a new mandate to take the party into that contest."" Labour slipped into third place in the Scottish Parliament at the last Holyrood election, and won seven seats at the last General Election. Matthews said: ""There has been tension between the Corbyn camp and Kezia Dugdale. She has previously called him divisive and said that he wasn't the man to take Labour forward. As he gained traction within the Labour movement and the larger population, she said that he was an electoral asset. ""Within the party, and in terms of Labour's wider electoral prospects, she probably saw the long road ahead and didn't see quite where she fitted in to the Jeremy Corbyn movie."" The Labour leader has recently been in Scotland for five days, visiting marginal constituencies in a bid to win back support for the party. Responding to news of her departure, Mr Corbyn said: ""I'd like to thank Kezia Dugdale for her work as Scottish Labour leader and the important role she has played in rebuilding the party in Scotland. ""Kezia became Scottish leader at one of the most difficult times in the history of the Scottish Labour Party, and the party's revival is now fully under way, with six new MPs and many more to come. ""I want to thank Kez for her tireless service to our party and movement, and look forward to campaigning with her in future for a country that works for the many not the few."" In her resignation letter, Ms Dugdale, who announced last month she was in a relationship with SNP MSP Jenny Gilruth, also referred to her close friend Gordon Aikman, who died from Motor Neurone Disease in February. She writes: ""He taught me a lot about how to live. His terminal illness forced him to identify what he really wanted from life. How to make the most of it, and how to make a difference. ""He taught me how precious and short life was, and never to waste a moment."" Scottish Labour's executive committee will meet on Saturday, 9 September to consider the timetable and process for selecting their new leader, with deputy leader Alex Rowley taking interim charge. Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of the Unite union, said there was ""no need to rush to a leadership election""."

Pay was among the major concerns for the 30,000 police officers surveyed, with 72% reporting they were dissatisfied with their remuneration package, and more than one in 10 saying they couldn't afford to pay for daily essentials. ""Officers do a heroic job as evidenced by the events of the past year, yet they feel undervalued and under pressure,"" said Steve White, chairman of the federation, which represents rank-and-file police. ""Something has to give, and unfortunately the evidence shows that it is these officers' personal welfare, as they struggle to meet rising demand with dwindling resources and 21,000 officers fewer than 2010."" Stresses on policing, and especially terror attacks in London and Manchester during the summer, meant the lack of a pay rise for officers was a major talking point during the 2017 General Election. Central government funding to police forces in England and Wales fell by 25% between 2010-11 and 2015-16. Although the government has now promised to protect it, a ""flat cash"" settlement will mean funding will fall in real terms. The cuts have prompted the National Police Chiefs Council to call for an increase in police funding, and a senior detective told Sky News in June that officers were considering suicide because of the strain on police forces. ""We really are at a point now where we can't cope with what we're expected to deal with,"" said Detective Inspector Warren Hines, who heads up one of six murder squads in the West Midlands. ""I'm aware of incidents where sergeants in our public protection units are allocating work on the basis of who is the least tearful that morning when they get to work."" Officers in the survey were also dissatisfied with a new direct entry scheme that allows civilians to join the force at the rank of superintendent or inspector, saying they believed it would have a negative impact on policing. A Home Office spokesperson said policing remained an ""attractive career"" with competitive pay and pensions. ""Job application rates are high with staff turnover and voluntary resignations remaining low compared with both the private and public sector,"" they said."

KCNA added that it is ""necessary to positively push forward the work for putting the strategic force on a modern basis by conducting more ballistic rocket launching drills with the Pacific as a target in the future"". :: North Korea threat: What does Kim Jong UN really want? Following urgent talks, the UN Security Council described North Korea's actions as ""outrageous"" - and accused Pyongyang of deliberately undermining peace and stability in the region. A statement added: ""The Security Council, resolute in its commitment to a denuclearised Korean Peninsula, emphasises the vital importance of immediate, concrete actions by the DPRK to reduce tensions in the Korean Peninsula and beyond."" The council also said it was committed to a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation. China and Russia's ambassadors to the UN said they opposed any unilateral sanctions on North Korea and reiterated calls to halt deployment of a US missile defence system in South Korea. Only last month, the council had imposed its toughest-yet sanctions on North Korea. It is not immediately clear whether any further actions could follow. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said: ""It is time for the North Korean regime to recognise the danger they are putting themselves in. ""The United States will not allow their lawlessness to continue, and the rest of the world is with us."" Following the launch, President Trump had said ""all options are on the table"". ""The world has received North Korea's latest message loud and clear: this regime has signalled its contempt for its neighbours, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behaviour. ""Threatening and destabilising actions only increase the North Korean regime's isolation in the region and among all nations of the world."""

Detectives from the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command are now reinvestigating the case, which was initially led by the force's special branch detectives. They believe allegiances may have shifted in the years that have passed, and witnesses who were not willing to speak at the time may be willing to come forward and could have crucial information.. Mr Al-Ali, a Palestinian who worked for Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas, often drew criticism for his cartoons, which were sometimes perceived as critical of the regime in Palestine. He had received a number of death threats in the years leading up to his murder The 51-year-old was walking to his work building in Ives Street after parking his car nearby when he was shot. Witnesses described seeing a man holding a black automatic handgun who ran away after the attack. One reported seeing another man crossing Fulham Road into Lucan Place and getting into the driver's seat of a silver-grey left-hand drive Mercedes shortly after the shooting. The gun - a 7.62 Tokarev pistol - was found in open space on the Hallfield Estate in Paddington two years after the murder. Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Met's counter-terrorism command, said: ""The brutal murder of Mr Al-Ali devastated his family and 30 years on they continue to feel the loss. ""We have previously reviewed this case and followed a number of lines of inquiry which have not resulted in us identifying these two men. ""However, a lot can change in 30 years - allegiances shift and people who were not willing to speak at the time of the murder may now be prepared to come forward with crucial information."" :: Anyone with information is urged to call the investigation team, quoting Operation Amazon, on 020 3276 9014, or 0044 203 276 9014 from outside the UK.

Officials say they have received disturbing reports of people impersonating Homeland Security special agents and telling residents to evacuate in order to rob their homes. The heaviest tropical downpour in US history has left an area 15 times the size of Manhattan under water, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper. City officials readied temporary housing for about 19,000 people, with thousands more expected to flee as flooding entered its fourth day and space ran out in cramped shelters. With many reported missing, the number of dead is expected to rise once floodwaters start to recede. The National Hurricane Center says the storm has now made a second landfall - hitting Louisiana, a state that still bears deep scars from deadly Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It is expected to produce an additional 15 cm to 30cm (6in to 12in) of rain to the north and east of Houston as it moves into southwestern Louisiana. The tropical storm is projected to weaken as it moves inland to the north east and over Mississippi by Thursday, the National Weather Service added. President Donald Trump visited the affected area on Tuesday, telling rescue organisers: ""This was of epic proportion, nobody has ever seen anything like this."" The President paid a visit to Corpus Christi, where the storm made landfall, and will not travel to Houston. On Tuesday, residents within 1.5 miles (2.4km) of a chemical plant in Crosby were ordered to evacuate due to the rising risk of an explosion and subsequent leak. A breached levee south of Houston and two overflowing reservoir dams outside the city are also adding to the rising water levels. The National Hurricane Centre warned of ""ongoing catastrophic and life-threatening flooding"" continuing across south eastern Texas. And The National Weather Service warned of dangerous flash flooding pushing northeast over the coming days. Rescue services say that make-shift shelters are beginning to run out of space, as two and possibly three ""mega-shelters"" are being planned to accommodate evacuees in Houston. With rescue services overstretched, civilians with boats and trucks are responding to calls for help and helping saving lives. On Wednesday, Singapore's defence ministry sent four military helicopters to assist with the relief effort, airlifting troops, evacuees and supplies. Damage is expected to run into tens of billions of dollars, making it one of America's most expensive natural disasters."

The meeting between Mr Davis and business leaders, which will follow a similar summit held in July, will take place on 15 September at Chevening House, the country residence he shares with two other Cabinet ministers. A source said on Wednesday that Mr Davis's invitation said he wanted to discuss views on the position papers ""outlining our approach to both withdrawal and to our future economic partnership with the EU"". ""It will be particularly helpful to hear these views ahead of the October European Council and the next round of negotiations I will be leading,"" the source added. The Chevening talks reflect a desire on ministers' part to be seen as adopting a more pro-business approach following months of criticism of the muted relationship between the Government and private sector bosses before the General Election. A new business liaison group has been established by Mr Davis, Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, and Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, while the Prime Minister has also begun holding formal meetings with the heads of major employers. The papers published during the summer - which covered issues such as citizens' rights, the use of data and the future jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - were criticised this week by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president. Analysis: Brexit negotiations are starting to feel like Groundhog Day Likely attendees at next month's Chevening talks include executives from major business groups such as the CBI and British Chambers of Commerce - both of which are also represented on Theresa May's trade visit to Japan this week. There has been growing frustration among business leaders about the lack of material progress on possible transition arrangements for the period after March 2019, when the UK will cease to be a full member of the EU. While ministers have sought to reassure bosses that there will not be a cliff-edge in terms of trading arrangements and relationships, companies are moving to activate contingency plans in case a satisfactory agreement can be reached. The shape of a future trade deal with the EU is also expected to be raised by bosses at next month's meeting, according to several senior executives. DExEU declined to comment on Wednesday."

A search aided by a police helicopter followed before he was located in the pool on the site and taken to North Devon District Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police said his death is currently being treated as unexplained but the youngster, from Weymouth, is reported to have drowned. The incident happened during a week-long summer holiday camp organised by Devon Narcotics Anonymous, a group that supports its members to stop using drugs and alcohol. The group described use of the swimming pool as ""supervised"" by the activity centre's ""trained lifeguards"" but Knapp House claimed that the group had ""self-supervised"" use of the pool. In a statement, Devon Narcotics Anonymous Summer Holiday Campout Committee said the group had ""enjoyed a wonderful week of sharing lives of complete freedom from drug and alcohol use"". It added: ""One of the activities we organise with Knapp House is the supervised use of their swimming pool with their trained lifeguards. ""Very tragically, something has gone horrifically wrong, and a young child of one of our members drowned in the pool. ""We are not aware of the exact details of how this happened, and the police are obviously investigating. ""As a committee... we are devastated that a truly wonderful week has ended so tragically."" Ashley and Stuart Clements, directors of Knapp House Activity Centre, insisted that the NA group had ""self-supervised"" use of the pool. ""It is with great sadness that we can confirm that a four-year-old boy has drowned in the swimming pool at our activity centre during an event organised by Narcotics Anonymous,"" they said. ""Our deepest sympathies go out to the young boy's family and friends. ""The group had the use of the pool on a self-supervised basis for recreational use - it was not part of the planned activity program that we provide. ""The event has always been a great success but we are all absolutely devastated that this year it has ended in such tragic circumstances.""

Woods was given a four-year and four-month jail term after pleading guilty to manslaughter. Mr Saunders' niece, Heba Soliman, speaking after the sentencing, said: ""The sentence will never be enough to bring back our uncle and we just hope that he (Woods) has to live with what he has done and we hope that he is remorseful for his actions."" Liverpool Crown Court heard that Woods had been walking through St Helens, Merseyside, just after 6.40pm on 21 July this year, when he approached Mr Saunders, who was with his friend Gregory Taylor, and asked for a cigarette. When both men told him they did not smoke, Woods punched Mr Saunders, causing him to fall to the ground and fracture his skull. The 65-year-old died in hospital nine days later. The court heard Woods, who was drunk and had taken drugs, had previously told his friend he would punch someone if he did not get a cigarette. When police went to Woods' home to arrest him the following day, the teenager tried to headbutt an officer and had to be restrained as he tried to escape. Judge Clement Goldstone told Woods: ""You snuffed out his life and brought untold sadness and grief to countless people. ""No sentence of this court can or will be seen as doing justice to the mindless violence which you perpetrated against Mr Saunders on the afternoon in question and no sentence of this court can bring him back."" Mr Saunders was described as ""a shining, yet very modest, star within the local St Helens community to which he devoted his life"". Ms Soliman told the court he had dedicated his life to charity and volunteering. She said: ""We will never forgive or forget the actions of the person that did this. He took away our beloved Len's life. He did so in the most evil and vicious way."" Mr Saunders' nephew, Ramy Soliman, said: ""If that boy had been in distress on that road, my uncle would have been the first person to go and help him. It's just so sad what's happened to him."""
2017-08-30,"The highest bridge in the UK has opened to traffic for the first time, marking the end of a 10-year, £1.35b building project.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/delays-as-queensferry-crossing-opens-to-traffic-for-the-first-time-11012393,"Northbound traffic was diverted to the 210-metre high Queensferry Crossing, on the main road between Edinburgh and Fife, at around 2am on Wednesday morning. But the fanfare was troubled by delays after a breakdown on the hard shoulder of the bridge caused tailbacks later in the day. Six years in the making, the new Queensferry crossing is the longest free-standing balanced cantilever bridge in the world, and stretches 1.7 miles between the banks of the Forth. It uses 35,000 tonnes of steel, 150,000 tonnes of concrete - almost enough cabling to stretch around the equator - and was built by a team from 24 countries. Its opening was preceded on Monday with a light show, and a procession of vintage and modern vehicles overseen by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Michael Martin, the Project Director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said build the bridge had been ""pretty stressful"" at times. ""This has been a challenging job from the outset - building the towers, the tallest bridge towers in the UK, in very hostile conditions,"" he explained. ""You are basically in the North Sea and the wind conditions, in the winter in particular, are truly horrible. ""There isn't a day goes past where you don't get something thrown at you, a problem to be overcome. But that's what engineering is about."" The new bridge is near to the Forth Bridge, a rail crossing built in 1882, and the original road bridge which will now carry cyclists, pedestrians and public transport. Bad weather delayed the completion of the new bridge by two years. But the crossing has been designed with the weather in mind, with perspex sheeting to prevent the weather troubling crossing vehicles. Cabinet Secretary for the Economy Keith Brown, who was among the first people to cross the new bridge in a chorus of car horns early on Wednesday morning, said the design was ""fantastic"". He said: ""You immediately notice coming over the new bridge - as traffic is now doing - the absence of the slap, slap, slap that you get on the existing bridge. ""It's a very smooth passage right across the Queensferry Crossing."""
2017-08-30,When there is a force to be reckoned with there must be a reckoning. North Korea's latest launch of a missile that flew over northern Japan is a signal that Kim Jong Un is now just one of those global forces.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-threat-what-does-kim-jong-un-really-want-11011206,"He's not Hurricane Harvey. He cannot realistically threaten the United States. But he's given ample evidence that he could, perhaps, if he were so minded, drop a nuclear warhead on Japan or drown South Korea in an atomic holocaust. The key here is the ""so minded"" bit. Sure he's a weirdly shaped man with a weird hairdo surrounded by sycophants. And the similarities to his nemesis, Donald Trump, don't stop there. Seeing into his mind, specifically the soundness of it, is something that not even his closest associates have been able to do. :: North Korea leader Kim Jong Un 'killed relatives over China coup plot' But it takes more than an ambitious autocratic nutter to build a nuclear weapon (or the impression of a nuclear weapon in the minds of the enemy). So what does the North Korean leader want, assuming he's not insane? He knows his country can we wiped off the face of the earth, with him at the epicentre of a nuclear firestorm. He knows he could get a few blows in against the South, perhaps Japan, before he was vapourised by the US. He will be certain in the knowledge that the outcome of a conflict with his neighbours would be to turn him into a grease stain in history. So war isn't what he wants. He's not a suicidal jihadi, he's the third Kim to occupy North Korea's throne and he wants, it seems, respect. Getting a nuke is a pretty good way to get it. It gives an impoverished dictatorship, perpetually on the brink of mass starvation, a global status that its otherwise comical leader does not deserve. The mutually assured destruction (MAD) of North and South Korea means that some kind of alternative has to be found - no matter how unpalatable. This is the moment to call the North's bluff. To offer the unconditional opportunity of negotiations before Kim gets hold of a really dangerous weapon. He's spun away from the influence of Beijing. But he is looking for a place in the world. Perhaps a role beyond the comic-book baddy he's so far played so well. His vanity is the gap in his armour and it is through that gap that an offer to talk should be whispered. What about? It does not matter. What matters is that the region is brought back from the Chinese have called this ""tipping point"". Isolating North Korea has failed as a tactic. It has driven the Kim dynasty to the point of threatening a war it cannot win but that it might fight. Kim is the kid excluded from school who has his face pressed against the chain link fence of international affairs. He'll be less dangerous if he's allowed into the playground."

Dr Palmer said: ""We have long enjoyed a loyal following from Japanese customers and the public alike, with our new dealership in Tokyo set to become our largest worldwide by volume.""

2017-08-30,Corporate governance doesn't sound sexy. It doesn't even sound very interesting. But in the heady days of Theresa May's ascension to the premiership it came to epitomise the change of gear between her and David Cameron.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/boardroom-pay-reforms-show-mays-domestic-agenda-has-withered-away-11011214,"Mrs May - and her then-chief policy adviser Nick Timothy - thought that the Brexit referendum result was about more than the EU or immigration or sovereignty. It was a ""cri de coeur"" from ordinary voters that the model of the British economy was broken, rigged in favour of big business and a corporate boss class who seemed to take all the rewards when things were good and pay little penalty when things went bad. In this she started to sound a little like Ed Miliband or Teddy Roosevelt or Joseph Chamberlain, a radical Liberal turned Conservative from the late 19th century and a hero of Mr Timothy. Mr Chamberlain was someone who was unafraid to use the power of the state to interfere in markets when required for the public good. So for instance as mayor of Birmingham he took local gas and water companies into public ownership (effectively local nationalisation). He was supposed to be the PM's new inspiration. This was a far cry from the diet of unalloyed free-market Thatcherism from which the Tory party had fed since the mid-1970s. You certainly couldn't have imagined the words of our second female prime minister coming out of the mouth of our first: ""I want to see changes in the way that big business is governed. The people who run big businesses are supposed to be accountable to outsiders, to non-executive directors, who are supposed to ask the difficult questions, think about the long-term and defend the interests of shareholders. ""In practice, they are drawn from the same, narrow social and professional circles as the executive team and - as we have seen time and time again - the scrutiny they provide is just not good enough. ""So if I'm Prime Minister, we're going to change that system - and we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well."" She went on to make a second, some would say anti-business pledge: ""We're the Conservative Party, and yes we're the party of enterprise, but that does not mean we should be prepared to accept that anything goes … So as part of the changes I want to make to corporate governance, I want to make shareholder votes on corporate pay not just advisory but binding."" This pledge was also included in the Conservative 2017 election manifesto. Together she said these two changes would help create ""a different kind of Conservatism … a break with the past."" This would be a different Tory party and a different Britain too. We now know that both of these reforms, which would have been a major transformation to the way British capitalism is governed, will not be included in the Government's proposals to be brought forward today. There will be some change. For example, firms will have to publish the ratios of the difference between their highest paid and lowest. But they are a far cry from the root and branch reform Mrs May had said was her ambition only a year ago. In that speech she also spoke of the importance of the creation of new grammar schools. That is also dead. The domestic agenda of Mrs May seems to have almost entirely withered away. Perhaps that is not surprising given the disastrous election result. She doubtless didn't wish to risk defeat in the Commons if some of her Thatcherite backbenchers rebelled. Or worse could only get the measures through on Labour votes. Thus alongside the unravelling of Mrs May's domestic agenda this saga also throws up one of the deep paradoxes of Brexit. Let's assume the PM was sincere in her wish to reform British capitalism, and I think she probably was. Had she come to office in different circumstances, without the Brexit behemoth looming large, she would have perhaps felt able to flex her muscles and be tougher on business. But with economic numbers going south and the lack of progress on a trade deal worrying UK plc she probably felt unable to announce anything which business would consider a disincentive to invest in the UK. Moreover if we also accept that the May analysis was right, that the vote was a wail of anger, a plea for governments to tame the power of massive companies and protect us against the rougher edges of globalisation and corporate greed, then it is a deep irony that the Brexit process seems to be making it harder for Britain to do much about it. And if no deal is reached, that paradox may get all the more acute. One option long discussed in Whitehall (and the veiled threat Chancellor Philip Hammond made earlier in the year) has been to pull the only other lever Britain might have in its arsenal if a deal is not forthcoming: to become a low-corporate tax (perhaps even tax haven) off the coast of Europe. Slash business taxes, liberalise labour law, reduce regulation: the Singapore option, one where, in the PM's words, in business ""anything goes."" I wonder if this is what many voters would have had in mind when they put their cross in the box and voted to ""take control"". Mrs May was asked during the election what Mayism was. She denied such a thing existed saying there was only Conservatism. But that was misleading. She had begun to sketch out what Mayism was. It would have been different to Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron. But Brexit and the General Election have both come together to reset the Conservative party back to its default setting. Mr Chamberlain, surely, would not have approved."

She has been attending the wedding with her parents in Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and guests began frantically searching for her after the DJ announced she was nowhere to be seen. Posters of the dark-haired girl have gone up throughout the town, with dozens of divers and police dogs deployed to search ""very dense vegetation"" and a river in the area. Yvez Marzin, the police chief in the region, said three sniffer dogs had all lost the scent from her cuddly toy at the same spot in a car park outside the party venue. ""One of the possible theories is that little Maelys left in a car, one way or another,"" he said. The 180 guests who attended the wedding, as well as 70 people who had gone to two other parties being held nearby, are being questioned by detectives. Dietlind Baudoin, a local prosecutor, said: ""Given the time that has elapsed since the disappearance of the young Maelys and given the resources that have been sadly deployed in vain to find her, the criminal possibility can no longer be ruled out.""

Business Secretary Greg Clark will give details of how £146m of previously announced funding, spread over four years, will support priorities including advanced therapies and medicines, vaccines development and manufacturing. Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, will pledge £14m to support medical technology research centres intended to encourage collaboration between the NHS and industry. Launching his ""ambitious"" report at the University of Birmingham, Sir John will say: ""We have created a strategy which capitalises on our strong science base to further build the industry into a globally-unique and internationally competitive life sciences eco-system, supported by collaboration across industry, Government, the NHS, academia, and research funders to deliver health and wealth."" The report calls for increased funding for basic science; improving growth and infrastructure; encouraging NHS collaboration through early access to new drugs and adopting a plan to invest in skills across the NHS and life sciences. The Government funding, first announced in the spring, will be available to companies, academic institutions and consortia operating in five priority areas. It will be awarded in a bidding process run by Innovate UK. Britain has an enviable scientific and medical tradition and a strong pharmaceutical industry, but the vote to leave the European Union prompted grave concerns within industry, academia and the NHS. The European Union's Medicine Regulatory Agency is to leave London as a result of the Brexit vote, with 19 EU member nations bidding to host the agency. Pharmaceutical industry leaders have warned that the MRA's departure will negatively impact on business and potentially patients in the UK, who may face a longer wait for new drugs as a result. Universities and academics have also warned that institutions may lose access to EU research budgets as a consequence of Brexit, which could impact on UK research and innovation. In comments released to the media prior to publication of the report Mr Clark did not address Brexit directly, but said: ""The life sciences sector is of critical importance to the UK economy and UK health - with over 5,000 companies, nearly 235,000 employees and a turnover of £64bn in 2016 - and the Government is committed to continuing to help this sector go from strength to strength."" Mr Hunt said: ""The UK has always been at the forefront of scientific excellence. From the discovery of antibiotics to our world-leading 100,000 Genomes project, we have a proud history of medical breakthrough and innovation. ""I want patients to continue to be at the front of the queue for the best treatments available... a strong and growing life sciences sector ensures this, particularly as we negotiate our exit from the EU."" The Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries (ABPI), which has lobbied for ""continuity"" in any Brexit deal, welcomed the Government investment in life sciences. Mike Thompson, chief executive of the ABPI, said: ""We look forward to working with Government and other partners to implement these recommendations - including through a sector deal with the bio-pharmaceutical industry and a voluntary agreement on UK medicines policy between industry and the Department of Health. ""These measures will provide confidence for global companies to invest in the UK during and beyond Brexit."""

2017-08-30,A Christian girl who was living with Muslim foster carers has been reunited with her family following a court ruling.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/christian-girl-fostered-by-muslim-parents-rejoins-family-11012387,"The five-year-old had been placed in the foster family's care by Tower Hamlets Council in east London. She is now living with her grandmother after a judge ruled against the local authority's placement. The decision was made by Judge Khatun Sapnara, who re-examined the case on Tuesday, said a spokesman for the Judicial Office, which represents judges. The Times reported on Monday that the English-speaking girl was left confused and upset by the foster family's use of Arabic. The newspaper said her necklace, which had a cross, was allegedly removed by the carers - and they had refused to allow the girl to eat spaghetti carbonara because it contained bacon. A social services supervisor reportedly said the child had sobbed and begged not to be returned to the foster family because of the language divide. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner, said she was ""concerned"" at the reports. ""A child's religious, racial and cultural background should be taken into consideration when they are placed with foster carers,"" she said in a statement. Social services bosses at the London council said there had been ""inaccuracies"" in reports and that the child had been temporarily placed with an ""English-speaking family of mixed race"". A council spokesman said in a statement that staff have ""always been working towards the child being looked after by a family member"". ""We would like to give more details but we are legally restricted to do so,"" he said. He added: ""Tower Hamlets Council has the welfare of children at the heart of what we do. ""The decision to choose foster carers for a child is based on a number of factors including cultural background and proximity to promote contact with the child's family and the child's school in order to give them as much stability as possible."""
2017-08-30,Japan is one of the UK's most important trading partners.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/japans-value-to-a-post-brexit-britain-explained-11012562,"In 2015, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics, it was the 11th largest buyer of UK exports, buying £10.5bn worth of British goods and services, putting it ahead of the likes of the United Arab Emirates, India, Australia, Canada and Russia. Britain is also a major buyer of Japanese goods, buying £9.6bn worth of goods and services that year, making the Land of the Rising Sun the 14th biggest supplier of imports to the UK. :: PM's Japan trip to focus on trade and security Strikingly, despite the very long history of Japan selling Britain manufactured items such as electrical goods, Britain enjoyed a trade surplus with Japan in 2015 for the first time in at least 16 years. The strength of British exports to Japan is all the more impressive given the ""gravity model of trade"", developed by economists over many years, which holds that the two biggest factors influencing trade ties between two countries are the size of the two economies and the distance between them. In short, the closer a country is to another, the more likely it is to trade goods and services with it. It is quite remarkable that Britain exports more to Japan, which is more than 9,000 miles away, than it does to Sweden, which is on our doorstep. Japan is also a crucial investor in Britain. In 2015, its companies were the fourth-largest overseas investors in the UK, while in 2016 alone, Japanese investors ploughed £27bn into buying 37 UK businesses, most notably the chip designer ARM Holdings. In total, there are around 1,100 Japanese-owned businesses in the UK, accounting for some 140,000 jobs. The best-known example of Japanese investment into Britain is in car-making. Nissan made 478,000 cars in Britain last year, of which around 80% were exported to the EU, while Toyota made 196,000 in the UK, nine in 10 of which went to the EU. Katsunori Kitakura, lead strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, one of Japan's largest asset management firms, said: ""An increase in costs following Brexit could lead to a decline in Japanese investment in the UK and the relocation of production bases to other EU countries. ""As such, the ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU will be crucial for the future investment relationship between the UK and Japan. ""Japanese companies want to continue their investments in the UK after Brexit. However, the UK government will need to respond to their requests and take measures to maintain the same business environment that is currently in place as far as possible."" He said Japanese manufacturers exporting from Britain to the EU were concerned about higher tariffs on exports following Brexit and also about tariffs on parts imported from the EU to the UK. Nor is Japanese investment in UK manufacturing confined to car-making. One of Britain's best-known manufacturers, the renowned St Helens-based glassmaker Pilkington, is owned by Nippon Sheet Glass. Hitachi, which developed Japan's famous ""bullet"" trains, built the javelin trains used on the high-speed rail link from London to the Channel tunnel at its site in Newton Aycliffe, Co Durham, which is currently producing new inter-city high-speed trains for the Great Western and East Coast Mainlines. Apart from the manufacturing sector, Mr Kitakura also highlighted the financial services sector, which is watching Brexit negotiations closely. He added: ""Many major Japanese financial institutions have their European operations based in the UK. ""If the EU single passport expires, it will be necessary to review office locations and staffing arrangements, In fact, Japanese financial companies have already begun steps to establish core bases in continental Europe in preparation for Brexit."" The facts speak for themselves. Japan, with its history of patient investment for the long term and promoting technical excellence, is a crucial, vital trading partner for the UK and one whose views our politicians must take seriously."
2017-08-30,"A charity has demanded card firms are banned from raising the credit limits of customers without permission, claiming those struggling with repayments are more likely to be targeted.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/ban-raising-credit-card-limits-without-permission-charity-11012231,"Citizens Advice says the practice has hit almost one in five borrowers struggling with long-term debt - accusing lenders of carrying out poor affordability checks. It released its report covering the activities of card providers at a time when regulators worry that consumers and banks alike may be getting out of their depth. Officials are particularly keen to avoid any credit bubble bursting. Unsecured borrowing - buoyed by low interest rates - has been growing much faster than household incomes at an annual rate of more than 10% this year. Figures released last month showed the total was back at its financial crash level above £200bn - with a third of that figure on credit card balances. However, there has been a noticeable slowdown in lending since the Bank of England's intervention - which also coincided with the Brexit-linked slowdown in the UK economy. Statistics published by the Bank on Wednesday showed unsecured borrowing rising at its lowest annual rate since April last year, at 9.8% last month though total credit card balances continued to rise to almost £69bn. :: Banks ordered to build up reserves to guard against shock Citizens Advice said it had helped nearly 66,000 people with over 140,000 credit card debt problems over the past year. It cited several examples of bad practice including the experience of one man who owed £15,000 on four different credit cards. The charity said that despite only making minimum repayments on each card which covered the interest, he was notified by all four providers that they were increasing his credit limit with his bill eventually hitting £30,000. The Financial Conduct Authority has proposed that people with persistent debt have their cards suspended to help them get to grips with the problem and avoid further charges. Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ""The regulator must ensure that lenders are taking into account people's whole financial and personal situation before agreeing further credit. ""Banning firms from raising existing customers' credit limits without seeking their express permission first would also help people take more control over their finances. ""Lenders must act responsibly and direct people struggling with debt towards free and independent advice and support - rather than more credit."""

Locals initially accused Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council, which has come under heavy criticism for their response to the fire, of painting over the mural. But the council told Sky News the building was private property and the artwork had been removed by the owner. People posted on Facebook that locals had ""loved"" the mural. Emma Daniels, who grew up in the Ladbroke Grove area, told Sky News that locals felt the mural was a ""fitting tribute"". ""We've got a community and we spent weeks painting this thing,"" she said. ""They've whitewashed a wall the same way they've whitewashed the problem,"" added Liz Martins, who lives in the area.. ""If it was a piece of Banksy art people would put a piece of plastic over it and protect it. It's still a piece of art with a message."" ""If it gets taken down it's going to go straight back up again,"" she added. The mural was created by Miguel De Amorim-Gil, a local artist who works under the name Flexwon. He told Sky News the removal highlighted tensions in Ladbroke Grove, an area affected by gentrification and where income inequality is high. ""I lost a lot of people in Grenfell and I had the backing of a lot of Grenfell survivors,"" Flexwon said. ""Taking this down is not helping people heal."" ""There is a lot of anger,"" he continued. ""You can't sugarcoat this."" The building, opposite a primary school attended by families affected by the Grenfell blaze, had been used for decades as a memorial site. Previous murals on the wall had been funded by the community and remained there for years. Flexwon said a representative of the council had visited the site and expressed support for the work. Locals also set up a petition to preserve the mural and create a memorial site. The council said it would continue to work with the owner of the property and the community on a project to mark the tragedy, preferably in the same location. ""The Council is now working with local artists, specifically graffiti artists, to create permanent murals for Grenfell around the community,"" a spokesperson said. ""We also intend to work with schools and building owners to put something the community wants in that same space."""
2017-08-30,Britain is facing a social care crisis with many people unaware and unprepared for the potential care costs that come with older age.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/britain-facing-social-care-crisis-charities-warn-11012199,"UK adults underestimated the average weekly cost for elderly residential care by over £300 when asked by think tank the Centre for the Modern Family. While the true cost of care is around £866 a week, when surveyed people substantially undervalued the fees, saying they thought it would be around £549 a week. One in four of those surveyed admitted they had no idea how they would cover these costs for themselves or a relative. With only 15% of people saving money on a monthly basis to pay for their own care when the time comes, and almost half (49%) said they avoided thinking about the issue because it makes them feel stressed. Jane Curtis, Chair of the Centre for the Modern Family said: ""The number of people in care in the UK will almost double by 2035. Our research shows that an over-reliance on relatives and the state could put families in serious financial difficulty. ""It's clear that many people simply don't understand the social care benefits and support system. Providing clarity and raising awareness of what is and isn't available is critical to helping people prepare for the longer-term future."" Currently you have to pay for care if you're in a residential home in England and have assets of more than £23,250. During the election the Conservatives said that will go up to £100,000 - but the new calculation will include the value of your house even if you're cared for at home. The government says they will now consult on their new funding proposals and a preliminary report is expected later this year. Emily Holzhausen OBE, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at Carers UK says it has been demanding action for decades but political stagnation on the issue has exasperated the problem. She said: ""All of these years as we have been discussing social care, our population has been ageing and the amount of care people get has been reducing, so if we were in a fair amount of crisis before, we certainly are now."" Nicola Dobey suffers from seizures which leave her unable to walk far. Her husband Paul is her full-time carer and their family of four rely entirely on the state for financial support. But the £1,200 they receive a month, does not go far. Paul Dobey told Sky News: ""It's not living, it's surviving, from day to day."" Despite only being 43-years-old, with no savings, Nicola fears being she will be unable to fund her social care in older age. She told Sky News: ""We're not going to be able to afford to go in to a home. Will the kids pay for us to go into a home? Will they have the money to pay for us to go to a home? ""Sooner or later I'm not going to be able to get upstairs, so what's going to happen? Do we sell the house? Do we bring a bed downstairs?"""
2017-08-30,The Police Service of Northern Ireland hired a private cybersecurity firm to investigate alleged Twitter accounts of officers mocking senior management.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/psni-hired-cybersecurity-firm-to-unmask-twitter-critics-of-chief-constable-11012405,"An internal investigation was launched a year ago after the PSNI's chief constable George Hamilton was criticised online for comments he had made to a junior officer on social media. Mr Hamilton told the officer to stop ""wallowing in self pity"" and ""dry your eyes"" after the officer raised concerns about the increasing pressures of the job. Following the exchange, a number of Twitter users criticised Mr Hamilton and posted anonymous complaints about the job and criticisms of PSNI management. The chief constable subsequently apologised to the officer. The PSNI brought in a private security firm to identify who was behind those accounts, many of which were suspended last week, according to the Press Association. One account posted a satirical recruitment video to Twitter showing PSNI officers dancing beside a police helicopter. A voiceover sarcastically suggests: ""Are you considering a career where every day you drive home you fear you will be shot? Do you want the rush of wondering if the IRA has planted a bomb under your car? Do you want to be told to dry your eyes when asking for mental health support? ""Then join the Police Service of Northern Ireland today. Recruitment is now open to a host of new officers to be belittled by senior management teams, spat on by the public, harassed by the police ombudsman and have their spirits crushed."" A security source told the Press Association that it was around the time of the video being made that the unnamed cybersecurity firm was asked to help trace the suspected police officers operating the accounts. One of the most concerning accounts had allegedly made racist and sectarian comments, had trolled other social media users and shared classified police information. On Monday, the PSNI said the organisation ""will not accept any racist, sectarian, sexist or homophobic behaviour from any of our staff."" PSNI assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton said the force was ""examining material posted on personal social media accounts by a number of individuals and are undertaking investigations to establish if the individuals are all serving officers."" Meanwhile, a survey of officers by the Police Federation has revealed they are becoming increasingly demoralised at work."

But critics said the ""absurd"" approach ""defied all logic"" and had reduced the role of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox to being ""left in a room with a photocopier"". Mrs May said: ""When we leave the European Union, there's obviously a number of trade deals that the EU has with other countries and we are looking at the possibility of those being able to be brought over into trade deals with the United Kingdom."" The PM is expected to reiterate the UK's commitment to a swift conclusion of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement during the trip. She will also seek agreement from Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the UK and Japan should work to ensure that this deal can form the basis of a bilateral arrangement ""quickly after Brexit."" The trip comes as the latest round of Brexit talks continue in Brussels, with top EU figures issuing downbeat assessments about the state of the talks. As a result of Brexit, Britain will have the opportunity to negotiate its own bespoke free trade deals with countries around the world. The UK can hold talks with other countries to lay the groundwork for post-Brexit free trade deals, but it cannot officially sign them until it has left the bloc. Opponents have been swift to point out that the approach of basing the deals on current EU arrangements does not match the lofty rhetoric of the EU referendum campaign. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""Brexiteers promised a new dawn of improved trade deals across the world. But rather than jet-setting around the globe, Liam Fox might as well be left in a room with a photocopier. ""The Government's Brexit strategy now defies all logic. It is not even asking Japan for a bespoke trade deal. India has already told us they won't give us one. The Government should not be surprised if China says the same. ""Far from bagging lots of new trade deals, the Government is simply trying to cut and paste our existing arrangements. Its Brexit strategy has just reached new levels of absurdity."" Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the pro-EU campaign group Open Britain, echoed this line of attack. He said: ""Leave campaigners like Boris Johnson told us that a global Britain needed to leave the EU to sign new and better trade deals, but it turns out the best the Government is aiming for is to copy and paste deals we already have through our membership of the EU. ""The Government's position is absurd. They are pulling out of the Customs Union, which will damage our economy, in order to sign trade deals which will be no better - and could easily be worse - than the ones we have now."" Also high on the agenda during the PM's trip to Japan is the North Korea crisis. Mrs May has called on China to ""do everything it can"" to apply more pressure on Pyongyang over its ""illegal"" and ""outrageous"" missile tests."
2017-08-30,"The Co-op Group has moved into pole position to swoop on Nisa Retail, trumping its rival J Sainsbury in an accelerating battle to consolidate Britain's convenience store market.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170830191108/http://news.sky.com/story/co-op-advances-talks-to-buy-convenience-group-nisa-retail-11012348,"Sky News has learnt that the board of Nisa Retail has granted a period of exclusivity to the Co-op to negotiate a takeover of the member-owned business. It comes just days after Sainsbury's put the brakes on its interest in Nisa amid concerns about competition regulators' likely view of a tie-up. In a message circulated on Wednesday, Peter Hartley, Nisa's chairman, told shareholders that the Co-op had ""confirmed, subject to further due diligence, its intention to progress matters as quickly as possible, in the hope that a transaction can be finalised"". Mr Hartley cautioned that ""key elements"" of a takeover by the Co-op had not been resolved, adding: ""Your board continues to focus on resolving them in a manner which is satisfactory to members."" ""As a result, and in line with the board of Nisa's duty to act in the best interest of all Nisa members, your board has granted the Co-op a period of exclusive due diligence from today. ""Thereafter, and subject to the results of the due diligence, it is anticipated that the Co-op could be in a position to make a final offer to the Members for your consideration. ""Should an offer of merit emerge from this process, it will be for you, the Members, to decide on whether to accept it. ""However, it is important to stress, that there is no guarantee that an offer will be forthcoming. ""As you are all aware our business and the convenience sector continue to evolve at pace and the board of Nisa will continue to review serious queries and offers which emerge (within the constraints of any agreed exclusivity period) and which it believes are in the best long-term interest of the members."" Scunthorpe-based Nisa, which is being advised on the sale process by bankers at Lazard, trades from roughly 3,000 stores across the UK. The Co-op has a long history in the wholesaling sector and is thought to have informed Nisa that it is prepared to pay close to £140m for the business despite the recent loss of a wholesale supply deal with McColl's to Wm Morrison. In a statement issued to Sky News, a Co-op spokesman said: ""We can confirm that we've entered into a period of exclusivity with Nisa, which will provide the opportunity for us to carry out more detailed due diligence in the coming weeks. ""Following this period and subject to approval from our board, we hope to be in position where we can put forward an offer to Nisa members "" Some Nisa members had expressed opposition to a deal with Sainsbury's. Roughly 1,400 members hold up to 250 shares each in Nisa Retail, which they can use to vote on issues such as board appointments at its AGM. Members are able to acquire additional equity up to the 250-share ceiling, with a simple majority required to vote through a change of ownership. Nisa recently finalised a £120m refinancing deal amid a shake-up of the sector which has been given extra impetus by Tesco's proposed £3.7bn takeover of the wholesaler Booker. Trading under brands such as Nisa Local, it has seen its fortunes improve under Nick Read, who took over as its chief executive two years ago. Mr Read, who joined after a £3m loss in 2015, has launched an ambitious transformation plan which includes a target of growing sales to £2bn by 2019. Last year, it recorded a £7.3m profit on sales of £1.3bn, enabling it to kick off fresh refinancing talks with lenders. In 2017, the comparable earnings figure is expected to be £8.5m. It grew its membership base by ‎a further 225 stores in the fourth quarter of its last financial year, and said this summer that it was ""in a positive position for the new financial year"". Some of Nisa Retail's members trade under their own names, with the group supplying stock and retail support in return for a fee. Despite the improved performance, Nisa Retail and rivals like Costcutter face challenging conditions, with growing competition from the major supermarket chains as well as discount-focused retailers. Palmer‎ & Harvey, a delivered wholesaler which supplies Tesco and other big retail groups, has been put up for sale following a struggle to negotiate its own refinancing. Britain's convenience sector was valued at £37.5bn last year, according to Nisa Retail - a figure expected to grow to £41.9bn by 2021, underlining its appeal to rivals."

Burke, who is due to appear in the upcoming season of Strictly Come Dancing, said her mother would have wanted her to ""carry on"" and appear in the BBC programme, as she revealed her loss. Burke wrote on Twitter: ""Mummy has always been my biggest supporter and was over the moon when I told her I was doing Strictly. ""It was always a dream of hers that I would one day be part of the show and I know that she would have wanted me to carry on xx.""

The group's single Wish, on which she recorded lead vocals, featured on their greatest hits album Volume IV in the same year. It peaked at number 24 in the UK singles chart. She went on to release more solo singles before forming a new band Soul Explosion. The Islington Tribune reported in 2008 that Bell suffered from kidney disease and needed regular dialysis which sometimes made it difficult for her to watch her daughter take part in the talent show she went on to win. In 2015, Bell told The Guardian that she had refused a kidney from her daughters as ""it may hamper their chances of having children"". Burke told the newspaper at the time: ""It was difficult at first, but now it feels normal to check on her every day. I would love to help her and she says I can donate a kidney after I have kids, but not before. ""Mum's illness means that I don't take a day for granted."""

In the days before Carnival, Sky News revealed that police have more than 20 million facial recognition images on the British public, including hundreds of thousands on innocent people. There are a number of legal questions surrounding the police's databases, especially following a High Court ruling in 2012 which said that the retention of those images was unlawful. Silkie Carlo, the technology policy officer for human rights group Liberty, observed the trial and described it as a ""worryingly inaccurate and painfully crude facial recognition operation"". Ms Carlo explained that the erroneously arrested individual was flagged up as being wanted on warrant for a rioting offence. However, betweem the construction of the suspect database and Carnival, the individual had already been arrested and was no longer wanted. ""The project leads viewed this as a resounding success - not a failure,"" wrote Ms Carlo. Independent sources have confirmed details in a blog post by Ms Carlo noting that five members of the public were flagged as suspects by the system and approached by officers to prove their identities. The individuals had identification documents on them, but had they not they could potentially have been wrongfully arrested. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Service declined to comment on the trial to Sky News.

Earlier, Mrs May stated she was ""in this for the long term"" - indicating she would lead the Tories into the 2022 election. This has been met with scepticism from colleagues - but the PM was defiant when asked about her future during an official visit to Japan. ""I'm not a quitter,"" Mrs May said, when asked to clarify her remarks as she finished the first day of a three-day trade mission. She said there were ""real issues that we need to be dealing with and I'm there to do it"". Asked about scepticism over her leadership ambitions back home, she said: ""For most members of the public, they would say they want the Government to get on with the job and that's exactly what I and the Government are doing."" Just two months ago, in an interview with The Sun, Mrs May refused to commit to fighting the next general election as head of the Conservatives. Last week, reports emerged that Mrs May was going to quit her premiership on 30 August 2019. Number 10 dismissed the claims as ""peak silly season"". The idea that she now wants to spend another five years as party boss came as a surprise to some of her MPs. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the backbench Tory MP who this summer dismissed reports he could be the next leader, threw his support behind the PM. ""It's important to have clarity and stability during the Brexit negotiations,"" he told Sky News. He said Mrs May was doing a good job in the talks, adding: ""She is offering leadership and clarity of purpose, but above all she is doing her duty. ""It can't be easy to be a prime minister at the moment and she is putting the interest of the nation ahead of her personal interest."" ""I think that's really impressive and deserves support."" Lord Heseltine, a former deputy prime minister for the Tories, told Sky News the idea was ""not realistic"". ""I don't believe there will an appetite, particularly in the parliamentary party, to rerun the last general election. I believe they'll want a new leader,"" he said. The Prime Minister has used her Japan trip to push the message she wants her premiership to stand for more than Brexit. In a huddle with journalists on the plane, Mrs May spoke about how she wanted to pursue a domestic agenda with renewed vigour. The Conservative Party conference in October is expected to concentrate on issues such as housing and education - taking Mrs May back to the speech she delivered on the steps of Number 10 after she was first elected as Prime Minister last summer. Former Tory leader William Hague has added his backing for Mrs May, despite her loss of her Commons majority in June. Lord Hague urged Conservative MPs to get behind the Prime Minister as she tackles Brexit. He said: ""In fact the ones who manoeuvre probably will not become the leader. ""They should get behind Theresa May and help her to do a good job in these exceptionally difficult circumstances of having to deliver Brexit and keep the economy going at the same time without a majority in the House of Commons."""
2017-08-31,"Theresa May needs to ""get her finger out"" over Brexit because it is going to be a ""disaster for the UK economy"", Ryanair's chief executive has told Sky News.

And he warned that flights to Europe could be hit if no trade deal was reached and the fallback of World Trade Organisation rules was triggered. ""There's no fallback in aviation,"" he explained. ""We're not covered by WTO rules. ""There is going to be a cessation of flights from March 2019 if she doesn't get her finger out and get a deal done in the next 12 months."" Mr O'Leary sounded a gloomy note on the progress of talks so far: ""The negotiations are not going well. What do the British expect? The Europeans will not move. The onus is on the British Government to deliver a deal."" He added: ""If there's no deal by March 2019 Britain gets thrown out of the European Union, you're out of Open Skies and there will be no flights. ""And we've been asking Mrs May's Government, what's the plan? What's Plan B, and we haven't got any Plan B, we haven't even got Plan A-and-a-half yet."" Mr O'Leary said the Government had only about a year left to indicate where the talks were heading - at least for his business. ""The problem for the aviation industry is we need to know six months before March 2019, so about this time next year - September/October 2018,"" he said. ""If there isn't the likelihood or the outcome of an agreement there will be skin and hair flying. ""People trying to book their holidays for summer 2019 here in the UK, this time next year, the options will be drive to Scotland or get a ferry to Ireland."" The Ryanair chief also suggested Mrs May had got her priorities wrong: ""She's just come back from the Swiss Alps - everybody's entitled to their holidays, but there is a crisis coming down the road. ""Brexit is going to be a disaster for the UK economy, and she needs to be over there negotiating, not swanning around Japan drinking tea and sake."" Mr O'Leary did, however, strike a note of optimism, saying his airline was planning on the basis that ""somebody"" in the Government would ""sort out the Brexit"". ""We're going to continue to invest in the UK and grow jobs here,"" he said."

She has been attending the wedding with her parents in Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and guests began frantically searching for her after the DJ announced she was nowhere to be seen. Posters of the dark-haired girl have gone up throughout the town, with dozens of divers and police dogs deployed to search ""very dense vegetation"" and a river in the area. Yvez Marzin, the police chief in the region, said three sniffer dogs had all lost the scent from her cuddly toy at the same spot in a car park outside the party venue. ""One of the possible theories is that little Maelys left in a car, one way or another,"" he said. The 180 guests who attended the wedding, as well as 70 people who had gone to two other parties being held nearby, are being questioned by detectives. Dietlind Baudoin, a local prosecutor, said: ""Given the time that has elapsed since the disappearance of the young Maelys and given the resources that have been sadly deployed in vain to find her, the criminal possibility can no longer be ruled out."" However, she stressed that all leads into the case are being explored, and she warned against ""making hasty conclusions""."

Talking is not the answer!"" Mr Trump tweeted. The US President's comments follow his declaration that ""all options are on the table"" after the North Korean missile flew over the Japanese island of Hokkaido. The test was considered to be one of the most provocative ever from the reclusive state, and came as US and South Korean forces conduct annual military exercises on the peninsula. Mr Trump's comments appeared to be contradicted by defence secretary Jim Mattis later in the day. When asked by reporters just hours later if the United States was out of diplomatic solutions, Mr Mattis replied: ""No. We are never out of diplomatic solutions."" North Korea's missile test took place a day before British Prime Minister Theresa May visited Japan. She called on China to ""do everything it can"" to put more pressure on North Korea to stop ""illegal"" and ""outrageous"" missile tests. Speaking to journalists on the flight, Mrs May said: ""The actions of North Korea, of DPRK, are illegal. They are significant actions of provocation. ""I think it's outrageous. That's why we will be working with our international partners - as we have done previously but we will be doubling our efforts with our international partners to put pressure on North Korea to stop these illegal activities."" :: UK shoulder to shoulder' with Japan over N Korea threat :: North Korea threat: What does Kim Jong Un really want? On Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated Beijing's call for peace talks. She said ""pressure and sanctions"" against North Korea ""cannot fundamentally solve the issue"". ""On the one hand, sanctions have continued to be put in place via resolutions, and on the other hand North Korea's nuclear and missile launch process is still continuing,"" she said. Earlier this month, North Korea reportedly made a miniaturised nuclear warhead that could fit inside one of its intercontinental ballistic missiles. It prompted Mr Trump to issue a warning of ""fire and fury"" on the North, while Pyongyang threatened to fire missiles towards the US territory of Guam. Any missile fired towards Guam would have to fly over Japan and analysts said Tuesday's test presented a major challenge to Tokyo and Washington. ""Pyongyang has demonstrated that its threats to the U.S. base on Guam are not a bluff,"" said Konstantin Kosachev on Tuesday, chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament's international affairs committee."

Woods was given a four-year and four-month jail term after pleading guilty to manslaughter. Mr Saunders' niece, Heba Soliman, speaking after the sentencing, said: ""The sentence will never be enough to bring back our uncle and we just hope that he (Woods) has to live with what he has done and we hope that he is remorseful for his actions."" Liverpool Crown Court heard that Woods had been walking through St Helens, Merseyside, just after 6.40pm on 21 July this year, when he approached Mr Saunders, who was with his friend Gregory Taylor, and asked for a cigarette. When both men told him they did not smoke, Woods punched Mr Saunders, causing him to fall to the ground and fracture his skull. The 65-year-old died in hospital nine days later. The court heard Woods, who was drunk and had taken drugs, had previously told his friend he would punch someone if he did not get a cigarette. When police went to Woods' home to arrest him the following day, the teenager tried to headbutt an officer and had to be restrained as he tried to escape. Judge Clement Goldstone told Woods: ""You snuffed out his life and brought untold sadness and grief to countless people. ""No sentence of this court can or will be seen as doing justice to the mindless violence which you perpetrated against Mr Saunders on the afternoon in question and no sentence of this court can bring him back."" Mr Saunders was described as ""a shining, yet very modest, star within the local St Helens community to which he devoted his life"". Ms Soliman told the court he had dedicated his life to charity and volunteering. She said: ""We will never forgive or forget the actions of the person that did this. He took away our beloved Len's life. He did so in the most evil and vicious way."" Mr Saunders' nephew, Ramy Soliman, said: ""If that boy had been in distress on that road, my uncle would have been the first person to go and help him. It's just so sad what's happened to him."""
2017-08-31,British officials have slammed their EU counterparts as being incapable of carrying out the Brexit negotiations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/eu-negotiators-incapable-of-flexible-brexit-talks-uk-officials-believe-11013133,"In a sign the talks have reached a particularly low point, officials from the UK's Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) are understood to have come to the conclusion their opposite numbers on the EU side do not have a mandate to negotiate effectively. The damning assessment by the British comes as Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is in Brussels, prepares to hold a news conference alongside his opposite number Michael Barnier to mark the end of the third round of talks. The European Commission's team of negotiators, led by former French minister Mr Barnier, are mandated by the governments of EU member countries to carry out the negotiations on their behalf. However, sources close to the Brexit talks have said British officials are increasingly of the view EU negotiators have not been given the freedom to negotiate, in the form of a loose framework, but are instead tied by a rigid template. The consequence - in the view of the British side - is deadlock, with the EU side setting out their position on the various issues and then waiting for the British to move to that position. The UK believes there is little in terms of a proper negotiating process bringing the two sides closer together. Responding, the EU side have said they can only move once they are entirely clear on what the British position is on the numerous issues. ""To be flexible you need two points, our point and their point,"" Mr Barnier told reporters on Wednesday. ""We need to know their position and then I can be flexible."" And in a tweet late on Wednesday, he wrote: ""European Council guidelines are designed for serious and constructive negotiations, but we need clear UK positions on all issues."" His department has given no further comment. On Monday, before the start of the latest round of talks, Mr Barnier said it was time for ""serious"" negotiations. ""To be honest, I'm concerned."" he said. ""We must start negotiating seriously. We need UK papers that are clear in order to have constructive negotiations."" Negotiations ongoing: #EUCO guidelines are designed for serious and constructive negotiations, but we need clear #UK positions on all issues In reference to Mr Barnier's comments, a British source familiar with the negotiations told Sky News: ""The view around town is that 'serious' means agreeing with them. That is not what it means."" Reacting to suggestions the UK has entered into these negotiations unprepared, British sources have claimed that as well as detailed ""position papers"" on the separation issues, they have entered into each negotiating session with detailed presentations. On the most intractable issue, the so-called divorce bill, three hours of intense discussion on Tuesday was accompanied by 23 slides and 11 pages of dense text, a source said, pointing out that the EU has provided just 4 pages to outline its position. ""Why would the UK negotiators sign off large sums on four pages?"" the source said. Broadly, it is clear this third week of negotiations has not gone well. Officials seem to have downgraded the definition of ""progress"" to simply meaning that issues have been discussed and better understood by both sides. Genuine progress on any of the key separation issues - the Northern Irish border, citizens' rights and the financial settlement - appears almost entirely absent. One hundred British and 47 EU negotiators have been locked in five separate rooms inside the European Commission headquarters all week hammering out the three issues. The EU has insisted ""sufficient progress"" must be made on all the separation issues before talks can move to the second phase - the future relationship and trade talks. The British have repeatedly claimed phase two trade issues must be discussed now as they are inextricably linked to the separation issues. :: May accused of pursuing 'cut and paste' Brexit over trade deals But the EU has flatly refused to allow any future relationship discussion. On the exit bill, the two sides appear to be approaching the issue from entirely different directions. The EU team's ""top-down"" approach is, according to sources familiar with the UK view, formulaic and over-eggs the amount actually owed. The British are insisting a ""bottom-up"" approach is the appropriate and legal way to reach agreement, as each area of financial contention involves unique issues. Neither side has ever said how much they believe the UK owes the EU in financial contributions, although the EU has consistently chosen not to deny a reported demand for €60bn (£55bn). Although Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson recently said Brussels could ""go whistle"" with its financial demands, the UK Government has accepted some sort of payment will be made and that it will meet its legal obligations. British negotiators have once again called for an intensification of the negotiating process with more negotiating rounds. The current timetable set by the European Commission allows for four negotiating days per month. It was hoped that ""sufficient progress"" on the separation issues would be achieved by a key summit of EU leaders in late October, but that is now looking unlikely. ""If it goes very slow, as is the case at the moment, it will be very difficult to say there is sufficient progress when we are in October,"" the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, told his fellow MEPs on Wednesday. Article 50 stipulates the UK must leave the EU by March 2019. And so the longer the phase one divorce issues take to agree on, the shorter the time available for the UK to try to shape its transitional arrangements and future relationship."
2017-08-31,London's Fire Chief has told Sky News she is having counselling because of the horrors she saw at the scene of the Grenfell Tower fire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/london-fire-chief-dany-cotton-has-counselling-over-grenfell-tower-fire-11013198,"Dany Cotton said she still cannot sleep at night, three months on from the disaster which killed at least 80 people. The capital's top firefighter said some of her colleagues who battled the blaze are having to take time off work to cope with the stress. The Commissioner, the first woman in the top job, says she could not believe her eyes when she first turned up at the scene. She said it looked like a disaster film and she found herself asking ""how on earth could that happen?"" Ms Cotton, who was in the tower with her crews as it burned, says they could have done nothing more to save lives, such was the fury of the blaze. In an exclusive interview, the commissioner addressed criticism at the time that there was a lack of high ladders to tackle the flames. She said the heat was so intense, they would have made no difference. Ms Cotton told Sky News that not a day goes by without her thinking about what happened in north Kensington and not just when she is at work. ""I'm not sleeping brilliantly. Like a lot of people, there's a lot going on in my mind. The effects of what happened that night will stay with me forever. ""I'm not making any bones about the fact that I'm having counselling."" Her real focus is her staff and making sure they get all the help they need, she said. Colleagues keep an eye on each other, looking for signs they are not coping. The people who are ""quiet and withdrawn"", she said, are the real worry. But the Commissioner is also concentrating on the future and wants the Government to reconsider a request from London mayor Sadiq Khan for £6m more in funding for the fire brigade in the wake of Grenfell. ""I really hope somebody is going to pay and recognise the fact that we need to be ready and prepared with the best equipment available,"" she said. ""Sadly I've not got a money tree stored in my office, or an endless budget, but there are new threats."" Dany Cotton hopes, as everyone does, that Grenfell Tower is a one off. But with a string of terror attacks already this year in the capital and the possibility of more to come, the Commissioner does not want to be strapped for cash as the need for the fire service peaks in future."

It was originally reported that the girl was Christian and had complained after she was placed by Tower Hamlets Council with carers who were Muslim. Now, in a ruling by Judge Sapnara, it has emerged there is evidence the girl's maternal grandparents have a Muslim background. The Times reported on Monday that the English-speaking youngster was left confused and upset by the foster family's use of Arabic. The newspaper said her necklace, which had a cross, was allegedly removed by the carers - and they had refused to allow the girl to eat spaghetti carbonara because it contained bacon. A social services supervisor reportedly said the child had sobbed and begged not to be returned to the foster family because of the language divide. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner, said she was ""concerned"" at the reports. Judge Sapnara decided to release an eight-page written order she had made following a private hearing in the East London Family Court on Tuesday. She said the case had a complex history and background. The girl's mother had told the court her family had a Christian heritage, the judge said, and had ""raised some concerns"" about whether her child's placement was appropriate. But she had never applied for a change of foster carer, the judge added. She said the little girl had been placed with foster carers on an emergency basis in March after police exercised their powers of protection. The judge said said ""no culturally matched foster placement"" was available at the time. Social services staff disputed allegations made against the foster carers and produced a statement which they said showed they had taken the ""cultural appropriateness"" of the foster placement into consideration. She said social services had since carried out an assessment of the mother's mother as a possible long-term carer. The judge said: ""It is positive and recommends her as a suitable carer. ""The grandmother has changed her position now to say that she wishes to return to her country of origin and care for the child there. ""Documents, including the assessment of the maternal grandparents, state that they are of a Muslim background but are non-practising. ""The child's mother says they are of Christian heritage."" The judge said the mother has now agreed to the girl going to live with her grandmother for an ""interim"" period - something the judge had approved. A further reconsideration of the case will take place at a hearing in the East London Family Court at 2pm on 2 October."
2017-08-31,The bitter fight between Sir Philip Green and the veteran Labour MP Frank Field escalated on Thursday when the tycoon threatened legal action over potential disclosures relating to his £363m BHS pension bailout.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/tycoon-greens-lawyers-warn-field-over-bhs-pension-disclosure-11014370,"Sky News has learnt that Sir Philip and his lawyers warned Mr Field that The Pensions Regulator had been alerted over what they allege would be a contravention of pension and data protection laws by the parliamentarian. The latest salvo in a months-long row between the two men follows a radio interview given by Mr Field last week in which he said he was in possession of confidential information obtained by the regulator during its probe into BHS's collapse. The MP said he had been the recipient of ""a major leak"" of papers relating to the pension deal prior to parliament's summer recess. Sir Philip's lawyers are understood to have responded on Thursday by warning that any disclosure of the information contained in those documents would be a breach of The Pensions Act 2004. Referring to Sir Philip's summer spent aboard his luxury yacht, Mr Field said last week he thought the tycoon would be feeling ""seasick"" about the revelation of details of the pension settlement. In his letter to Mr Field, a copy of which has been seen by Sky News, Sir Philip described the latest allegations by the MP as ""disgraceful"", saying: ""You claim to have new dynamite evidence against me. ""How can this be the case when the document you referred to on the radio is not new; it is a document produced by the Regulator last year?"" He added: ""You will today receive a letter from my lawyers which you should read very very carefully in order that you clearly understand the content and the seriousness of your actions."" It is not the first time that the owner of Topshop and Dorothy Perkins has threatened Mr Field with court action. Sir Philip has repeatedly claimed during the last 16 months that he has been the subject of a witch-hunt led by Mr Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee. ‎A non-binding parliamentary vote was held last year which resulted in MPs declaring that Sir Philip should forfeit his knighthood, although the high street tycoon subsequently agreed to pay more than £360m into BHS's two retirement schemes. ""Surely everyone can see, except you it seems, that I have fulfilled what I had said I would do,"" Sir Philip wrote in his letter to Mr Field. ""This sum of money was paid on a strictly voluntary basis, a settlement was reached with the regulators and I was given statutory clearance by them."" Mr Field is understood to have received the letters from Sir Philip and his lawyers on Thursday evening. The MP said: ""I welcome this intervention from Sir Philip Green. ""We now know it's going to be a multi act drama - he's not boxed this off into a one act play. ""I feel sorry for the lawyers who've had to write me a letter like this. This is a bullying act by Sir Philip."" It is the latest in a string of legal threats and actions relating to the collapse of BHS. Last week, the pensions watchdog announced that it was prosecuting Dominic Chappell - who bought BHS for £1 in 2015 - over his alleged failure to cooperate with its investigations. Meanwhile, the liquidators of the high street chain said last Friday that they were dropping a legal claim against Sir Philip after his Arcadia Group agreed to relinquish a claim over £30m of BHS's assets That agreement meant that unsecured creditors in BHS will eventually be handed tens of millions of pounds more from the wreckage of the retailer, following a lengthy row over a £35m fixed and floating charge held by Arcadia. FRP Advisory, the joint administrator and subsequently the liquidator of BHS, had queried that charge seven months after BHS collapsed with the loss of about 11,000 jobs. A spokesman for The Pensions Regulator declined to comment."

The two brothers and the Duchess of Cambridge also visited the White Garden that has been planted in Kensington palace gardens in memory of their mother and hosted representatives from half a dozen charities that she supported in the years before she died. Peter Waddup from The Leprosy Mission told Sky News she continues to have an impact, after becoming the most high profile person in the world to touch anyone who had leprosy. He said: ""There was certainly this opinion this woman that was admired by so many people that she is a bit crazy because she is getting near to people that most of us wouldn't speak to and wouldn't go near and so it was incredible the impact she had. ""We work in 32 different countries, everything she did, all the personal meetings she had with patients affected by leprosy are still making a difference today."" There are no formal events planned to mark the Princess' death and the Princes are expected to spend the day privately. Crowds are expected to gather in Kensington Palace gardens. Throughout the summer newspapers and magazines have run dozens of articles about every aspect of Diana's life, and television documentaries have also reflected on the circumstances surrounding her death and her legacy, a sign of the continued appetite to learn more about Diana, the wife, mother and international icon."

Mrs May earlier called on China to step up its action against North Korea and refused to rule out Britain getting involved in military action to stop the rogue state's illegal weapons programme. Downing Street said the length of time the PM had spent with Mr Abe on the first day of three-day visit was ""unusual"" and demonstrated the ""strength and continuing positive relationship"" between the two. :: Theresa May hails Aston Martin's £500m worth of trade with Japan The pair met at the Omotesenke tea house in Kyoto, where the tea-making ceremony dates back to Sen no Rikyu, the 16th century founder of the tradition. Mrs May, who was wearing a red dress and white jacket - the colours of the Japanese flag - removed her leopard print pumps before emerging from the back of the tea house side by side with Mr Abe, who pointed out moss in the garden. ""Very attractive, very calm,"" the PM said. Flanked by interpreters, the leaders sat on a low bench behind the table while the master of ceremonies and his two assistants sat on the floor on the other side of the room. :: Analysis: Japan's value to a post-Brexit Britain explained Before getting on a high-speed bullet train to Tokyo, Mrs May and Mr Abe enjoyed a banquet that included ""salted entrails of the sea cucumber"". Talks over the course of the day focused on North Korea, which on Tuesday fired a missile over Japan, but Brexit was also touched upon. Critics back home have accused the PM of pursuing a ""cut and paste"" Brexit after saying she wanted to use the trade deal being finalised between the EU and Japan as the starting point for a future agreement with Britain. Mrs May is expected to use the trip to reiterate the UK's commitment to a swift conclusion of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. She will also seek agreement from Mr Abe that the UK and Japan should work to ensure that this deal can form the basis of a bilateral arrangement ""quickly after Brexit."""

Driver Samuel Saldivar escaped through a window but was unable to rescue the other six passengers - his parents Belia Saldivar, 81, and Manuel, 84, along with their great-grandchildren Devy, 16, Dominic, 14, Xavier, 8, and Daisy, 6. He survived by clinging onto a tree and was rescued by officers who were alerted to his shouts. After floodwaters in the area receded, the van was spotted by family members and recovered by police. Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said: ""The family is devastated, we all are as well. Our worst fears have been realised."" Storm Harvey has caused catastrophic flooding in Houston and other parts of Texas, leaving billions of dollars of damage in its wake. Forecasters say Louisiana is now ""under the gun"" of the storm after it made landfall for a second time. As Harvey bore down on her home on Sunday morning, Devy Saldivar spoke of her fears on Facebook. She posted: ""No sleep & anxiety, please let this pass sooner."" Hours later, her great-uncle Sammy tried to drive the family to safety but got into difficulty as floodwaters engulfed the van on a bridge. Sammy's brother Ric said water ""picked up"" the vehicle and sent it plunging into a stream. ""It went headfirst in and water came in real fast,"" Ric Saldivar told CNN.

2017-08-31,I'll admit I was rather shocked by Theresa May's answer to my question over whether she wanted to fight the next general election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/pm-had-little-choice-but-to-say-yes-to-another-election-11013977,"She responded with a straight ""yes"". Firstly, she'd not said it before; secondly, it was an unequivocal answer to a direct question by a Prime Minister who often avoids and deflects with planned soundbites, not always relevant to the enquiry. :: PM: I'm no quitter and will fight 2022 election Then I was left wondering, what choice did she have? At some point the Prime Minister had to put this question to bed. With reports, perhaps 'fake news', suggesting she'd set a date to resign - it was time to take a position. If she'd confirmed she was making a mid-term exit, after Brexit, that would have fired the gun for a two-year leadership race, immediately undermining her authority. So if she does eventually quit then, like her disastrous election, it has to be a snap decision. It could, however, also be the political determination of a woman described by Ken Clarke as ""bloody difficult"" and who has chosen to be bloody difficult to remove. After all, she's waited long enough for the job - and a lot can be learned from her opposition leader about blanking out the negative voices. She will have to do that today. Former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, former party chair Grant Shapps and Tory grandee Michael Heseltine all expressed surprise at her determination to go on. The critics tend to come from the Remain camp and supporters from the Eurosceptic side of the party. Those vocally supporting Mrs May include John Redwood, Boris Johnson and Peter Bone, who says she will ""emerge a national hero"" if she delivers Brexit. On that subject, the Japan trip is having mixed results. Mrs May appears to have a reassurance from her counterpart Shinzo Abe that he will work toward a free-trade deal with the UK based on the EU deal once that has been has been concluded. He also made positive sounds about continued investment in the UK after Brexit - but made clear that Japanese companies saw the UK as a ""gateway to the EU"" and they would be would be ""watching carefully"" how the UK approaches Brexit. Mr Abe's main concern seemed to be ""minimising the impact of Brexit"". He asked Mrs May for ""transparency and predictability"" during her EU exit negotiation. It's clear the Japanese PM sees Brexit as a damage limitation exercise - and as it happens that is what's going on in the Conservative Party right now following Mrs May disastrous snap election. Big questions remain over whether that includes restructuring at the top."
2017-08-31,Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster has called for the immediate restoration of Northern Ireland's devolved government alongside a parallel process to deal with outstanding areas of disagreement.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/dup-leader-arlene-foster-calls-for-parallel-process-to-break-stormont-deadlock-11014501,"Addressing her party executive for the first time since the General Election, she dismissed claims that the DUP did not want a return to devolution because of ""the unprecedented position"" it now finds itself in Westminster. Mrs Foster said: ""As appealing as it first appears, that view fails to take account of our longer-term best interests. ""The Democratic Unionist Party has always believed that Northern Ireland is best governed by a democratic, fair and accountable government comprising locally elected representatives."" The former first minister said Northern Ireland could not continue without democratic oversight and envisaged ""the speedy introduction of direct rule"" if agreement is not reached. She said it was clear another prolonged negotiation would be ""little short of a waste of time"" and offered an alternative solution. ""I am proposing that we restore an Executive immediately,"" she said. ""Put ministers back into posts so that decisions can be made and that Northern Ireland can have a government again. ""We also agree to bring forward legislation to address culture and language issues in Northern Ireland within a time-limited period to be agreed. ""If we fail to do that in a way that commands cross-community support, then the Executive would cease to exist."" Earlier, Sinn Fein again refuted the suggestion that the party was not committed to the restoration of devolved government. Responding to comments made by Mrs Foster, Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's leader at Stormont, said her party was ""entirely committed to making the political institutions work for all citizens"". ""For over 10 years Martin McGuinness maintained the Executive while seeking to have the outstanding commitments of the agreements implemented with respect and equality for all,"" she said. ""Over this period the DUP and the British government refused to honour the agreements and operate powersharing on the basis of equality. On that basis Martin McGuiness resigned. ""The statement by the DUP leader demonstrates that they have not listened or acknowledged the reasons of Martin's resignation. ""Establishing an Executive that may collapse after a matter of months on the same issues will only fail all our people. ""Let's agree to quickly conclude talks on implementation and rights, that is the only way to build a sustainable Executive that will last."" The DUP and Sinn Fein had been sharing power for almost 10 years when the devolved government collapsed over a botched renewable energy scheme costing millions of pounds. Six months after the Northern Ireland Assembly election, there appears little hope of an agreement to restore it and prevent the return of direct rule from Westminster."

The Deadline news site reported that filmmakers Scott McGehee and David Siegel are contemplating rewriting the novel for screen, with a group of schoolgirls instead of young male characters like Ralph, Jack and Piggy. The pair said they hoped to do a ""very faithful but contemporised adaptation of the book"", which they said was about children ""replicating the behaviour they saw in grown-ups."" They hope the new film - which is still in the early concept stages - could break away from conventions around the ""ways we think of boys and aggression."" But online, the idea has not gone down well [flies into frame on a broom]the thing about lord of the flies is that it's about systemic male violence + how it replicates[flies away] According to a lot of readings, the whole point of Lord of the Flies is that it tackles how we think about boys and aggression. uhm lord of the flies is about the replication of systemic masculine toxicity every 9th grader knows thisu can read about it on sparknotes https://t.co/EQFyuSA3MV And a lot of people think that a story about boys replicating destructive masculinity might not make sense if men are replaced by women. Many critics suggested the remake had already been created in the form of movies like Mean Girls or 1980s clique murder flick Heathers. The WB is remaking Lord of the Flies with an all female cast. It will take place in a high school and be called 'Mean Girls' Others imagined what a Lord of the Flies featuring girls might actually look like, and came to the conclusion it might not be blockbuster material. The all-female Lord of the Flies will just be a group of young women apologizing to each other over and over till everyone is dead. The news also prompted criticism for failing to make an effort to tell stories that had been written and produced by women - especially since the proposed movie would be made by two men. imagine having such little interest in seeking out original stories about girlhood by women that you remake LORD OF THE FLIES with girls William Golding spoke about why he wanted to write a story describing how boys would ""really behave being boys and not little saints."" One reason was that he had been a boy too, so knew what he was talking about. But he also said a group of boys would be ""more like scaled down society than a group of little girls will be."" ""I think women are foolish to pretend they're equal to men. They're far superior and always have been,"" he said. ""One thing you cannot do with them is take a bunch of them and boil them down, so to speak, into a set of little girls who will then become a kind of image of civilisation of society."""
2017-08-31,When there is a force to be reckoned with there must be a reckoning. North Korea's latest launch of a missile that flew over northern Japan is a signal that Kim Jong Un is now just one of those global forces.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-threat-what-does-kim-jong-un-really-want-11011206,"He's not Hurricane Harvey. He cannot realistically threaten the United States. But he's given ample evidence that he could, perhaps, if he were so minded, drop a nuclear warhead on Japan or drown South Korea in an atomic holocaust. The key here is the ""so minded"" bit. Sure he's a weirdly shaped man with a weird hairdo surrounded by sycophants. And the similarities to his nemesis, Donald Trump, don't stop there. Seeing into his mind, specifically the soundness of it, is something that not even his closest associates have been able to do. :: North Korea leader Kim Jong Un 'killed relatives over China coup plot' But it takes more than an ambitious autocratic nutter to build a nuclear weapon (or the impression of a nuclear weapon in the minds of the enemy). So what does the North Korean leader want, assuming he's not insane? He knows his country can we wiped off the face of the earth, with him at the epicentre of a nuclear firestorm. He knows he could get a few blows in against the South, perhaps Japan, before he was vapourised by the US. He will be certain in the knowledge that the outcome of a conflict with his neighbours would be to turn him into a grease stain in history. So war isn't what he wants. He's not a suicidal jihadi, he's the third Kim to occupy North Korea's throne and he wants, it seems, respect. Getting a nuke is a pretty good way to get it. It gives an impoverished dictatorship, perpetually on the brink of mass starvation, a global status that its otherwise comical leader does not deserve. The mutually assured destruction (MAD) of North and South Korea means that some kind of alternative has to be found - no matter how unpalatable. This is the moment to call the North's bluff. To offer the unconditional opportunity of negotiations before Kim gets hold of a really dangerous weapon. He's spun away from the influence of Beijing. But he is looking for a place in the world. Perhaps a role beyond the comic-book baddy he's so far played so well. His vanity is the gap in his armour and it is through that gap that an offer to talk should be whispered. What about? It does not matter. What matters is that the region is brought back from the Chinese have called this ""tipping point"". Isolating North Korea has failed as a tactic. It has driven the Kim dynasty to the point of threatening a war it cannot win but that it might fight. Kim is the kid excluded from school who has his face pressed against the chain link fence of international affairs. He'll be less dangerous if he's allowed into the playground."
2017-08-31,Ladbroke Grove residents say they are angry and frustrated that a mural for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire was painted over.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/anger-after-grenfell-justice-mural-whitewashed-11012799,"The graffiti design, which featured the word ""Justice"" and the names of people killed in the blaze, was found whitewashed on Wednesday morning. Locals initially accused Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council, which has come under heavy criticism for their response to the fire, of painting over the mural. But the council told Sky News the building was private property and the artwork had been removed by the owner. People posted on Facebook that locals had ""loved"" the mural. Emma Daniels, who grew up in the Ladbroke Grove area, told Sky News that locals felt the mural was a ""fitting tribute"". ""We've got a community and we spent weeks painting this thing,"" she said. ""They've whitewashed a wall the same way they've whitewashed the problem,"" added Liz Martins, who lives in the area.. ""If it was a piece of Banksy art people would put a piece of plastic over it and protect it. It's still a piece of art with a message."" ""If it gets taken down it's going to go straight back up again,"" she added. The mural was created by Miguel De Amorim-Gil, a local artist who works under the name Flexwon. :: Inquests opened into victims Hesham Rahman and Ernie Vital:: Grenfell: The victims  He told Sky News the removal highlighted tensions in Ladbroke Grove, an area affected by gentrification and where income inequality is high. ""I lost a lot of people in Grenfell and I had the backing of a lot of Grenfell survivors,"" Flexwon said. ""Taking this down is not helping people heal."" ""There is a lot of anger,"" he continued. ""You can't sugarcoat this."" The building, opposite a primary school attended by families affected by the Grenfell blaze, had been used for decades as a memorial site. Previous murals on the wall had been funded by the community and remained there for years. Flexwon said a representative of the council had visited the site and expressed support for the work. Locals also set up a petition to preserve the mural and create a memorial site. The council said it would continue to work with the owner of the property and the community on a project to mark the tragedy, preferably in the same location. ""The Council is now working with local artists, specifically graffiti artists, to create permanent murals for Grenfell around the community,"" a spokesperson said. ""We also intend to work with schools and building owners to put something the community wants in that same space."""
2017-08-31,Prince William and Prince Harry have opened up for this 20th anniversary in a way that we've never heard them talk about Princess Diana before.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/prince-william-and-harry-dianas-love-and-energy-wouldnt-go-to-waste-11013155,"In two interviews for documentaries they have very deliberately wanted to talk about their mother. They are grown up now, have their own defined public roles, and this is a chance for them to take ownership of their mother's story. But it's also given a new striking insight into how they coped in the days after her death. It's still hard to comprehend how two boys, just 12 and 15, walked behind their mother's coffin in front of an international audience of millions. Not shedding a tear as thousands in the crowds wept. William has talked about hiding behind his fringe as they walked past the crowds, ""It wasn't an easy decision and it was a sort of collective family decision to do that. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But we were overwhelmed by how many people turned out, I mean it was just incredible. There is that balance between duty and family and that's what we had to do."" In an interview with Newsweek earlier this year Prince Harry seemed to criticise the decision to make them walk. He told the publication: ""I don't think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances. I don't think it would happen today."" But in a documentary interview he seemed to contradict that saying: ""I think it was a group decision, but before I knew it I found myself, you know, with a suit on, with a black tie, white shirt I think, and I was part of it. Genuinely, I don't have an opinion whether that was right or wrong - I'm glad I was part of it. Looking back on it now, I'm very glad I was part of it."" At the time the royal family faced public outcry as they stayed up in Balmoral. No one in the family has ever talked about it. But this has been a chance for William and Harry to defend the Queen and for the first time talk about their fathers support. Harry said: ""One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died. How you deal with that I don't know but, you know, he was there for us. He was the one out of two left and he tried to do his best and to make sure we were protected and looked after. But, you know, he was going through the same grieving process as well."" His brother William added: ""At the time, you know, my grandmother wanted to protect her two grandsons and my father as well. Our grandmother deliberately removed the newspapers and things like that, so there was nothing in the house at all, so we didn't know what was going on. We had the privacy to mourn and kind of collect our thoughts and to try and just have that space away from everybody."" The way the Prince's interact with the press continues to be a talking point today. Hearing them talk about how as young boys they witnessed Diana being pursued by the paparazzi certainly helps to explain further why they are reluctant to let the press get too close. Prince William said it was often the thing that would upset his mother most. He said: ""I don't believe that being chased by 30 guys on motorbikes, who block your path, who spit at you, who shout at you and who react really badly to get a reaction from you and make a woman cry in public to get the photographs - I don't believe that is appropriate. I certainly remember most of the time she ever cried was to do with press intrusion."" In the context of how she died, the role of the paparazzi is even more raw for Prince Harry, he said: ""I think one of the hardest things to come to terms with is the fact that the people that chased her through into the tunnel were the same people that were taking photographs of her while she was still dying on the back seat of the car. And William and I know that, we've been told that numerous times by people that know that was the case. ""She'd had a - quite a severe head injury, but she was very much still alive on the back seat, and those people that - that caused the accident instead of helping were taking photographs of her dying on the back seat. And then those photographs made - made their way back to news desks in this country."" But there have also been touching moments, where they've shared their fondest memories of a woman who was most importantly their mum, including a story about Diana inviting supermodels to Kensington Palace. Prince William said: ""She organised when I came home from school to have Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell waiting at the top of the stairs, I was probably a 12 or 13-year-old boy who had posters of them on his wall. ""I went bright red, and didn't know quite what to say and sort of fumbled and I think pretty much fell down the stairs on the way up. I was completely and utterly awestruck. That was a very funny memory that's lived with me forever..."" Prince Harry also describes her as ""a total kid through and through"" whose motto was ""you can be as naughty as you want, just don't get caught"". But most poignantly you get the sense they just want their mother to be proud of them and how they dealt with her death. Prince William said: ""I wouldn't let it break me, I wanted it to make me. I wanted her to be proud of the person I would become. I didn't want her worried or her legacy to be that, you know, William or Harry were completely devastated by it, and that all the hard work and all the love and all the energy that she put into us when we were younger would go to waste."""
2017-08-31,There has been a dramatic drop in the number of Cash ISAs being opened and in the amount saved in the wake of the Brexit vote.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/cash-isa-saving-falls-by-a-third-as-tax-rules-change-11013819,"Official figures from the taxman show there were 1.6 million fewer accounts taken out in the last financial year - falling to 8.5 million. The biggest fall was reserved for the amount saved - dropping by £19.5bn in 2016/17 to £39.2bn. It represents a reduction of 33% on the previous tax year, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) said, at a time when other data has shown household saving rates hitting all-time lows during 2017 as prices rise at a higher rate than wages. Financial analysts blamed the introduction of the personal savings allowance last year, which allows basic rate taxpayers to earn £1,000 of savings without paying any tax (£500 for higher rate taxpayers). It means the interest to be earned from many bank account savings is on par with Cash ISAs - whose best rates are currently only around 1%. Analysts suggested the cut in interest rates in the wake of the EU referendum result were also a factor. :: Spending power in longest decline since 70s as savings hit new low At the same time, the HMRC figures showed the amount of money invested in stocks and shares ISAs had overtaken the total held in the cash versions for the first time on record. It reported totals of £315bn versus £270bn respectively. Danny Cox, chartered financial planner at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Low interest rates and the new personal savings allowance have precipitated a collapse in cash ISA saving. ""While understandable, this may prove to be short-sighted as neither low interest rates nor the personal saving allowance are necessarily a permanent fixture of the financial landscape, though it's fair to say both do look set to remain in place for the foreseeable future."" He added: ""ISAs are the saver and investor's friend and should be at the heart of every portfolio. ""Record subscriptions to stocks and shares ISA are a reflection of interest rates being at such a low ebb and the stock market being pretty much the only game in town if you want an income from your savings."""

The West London palace was Diana's home until she died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in Paris. It became a focus for thousands of mourners who came to leave flowers and remember her.

2017-08-31,Many people are reflecting on where they were when the news of Diana Princess of Wales's death was announced.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170831195829/http://news.sky.com/story/princess-diana-the-royal-death-that-shocked-the-world-11013222,"For me it's easy. I was in bed at home and woke when the 'pager', which Sky News insisted I carry at all times, buzzed into life. Bleary eyed, I reached for it and read the code words I half expected ""Royal Down"". All broadcasters had for some time prepared themselves to respond to the Queen Mother dying. She seemed eternal but was then in her 97th year. Seconds later, my mother came into the room and told me what she had just seen on the television. The shock was intense. Diana was my age. Her life had seemed agonisingly complicated and public in the months preceding this jolt, but this development was beyond all fathom. As Sky's Commentator of National Events, it was not immediately clear what my role might be. After all, the marriage between Prince Charles and Diana had been over for some time and it didn't seem likely that a Royal Ceremonial Funeral would follow. My instinct (how wrong I was), leant towards a Spencer family funeral. The only part of this that arguably did transpire was that the Spencer's retained a strong lead in presence and style and, after 10 fraught days, Diana found her eternal rest on the island in the lake of her family home. Diana was a phenomenon and so, as frequently happens in Britain, events took hold of protocols and made them bend to a ferocious public expectation and utility. By the time I was sat in the studio at Osterley at 9am on the morning of the funeral - the audible apex to a gargantuan team effort by Sky - the United Kingdom had writhed through a heart attack of sorts. In the middle of this wounded lion's cage stood the courtiers at Buckingham Palace, who had zero precedent to draw on and must have had to fumble in search of the right solution. While this evolved, the newly elected and exceptionally popular Government had a strong influence, the media's views were everywhere and Diana's family must have fought for space. The Armed Forces were put on standby but, for what? Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Ross was the Queen's principal adviser on ceremonial matters. We had both served in the Scots Guards and I'm sure his training must have helped. His team, in what is called the Lord Chamberlain's Office, worked through the nations emotions to fix upon a ceremonial and an Order of Service. Any family that faces bereavement, especially a shock one, must recognise that there can be difficulties. I'm sure errors of approach must have been made by all sides, many might have been disappointed by stands taken or ideas posed but, in the end, the book of protocol produced a unique ceremony for a unique person. The template for Diana's funeral, at Westminster Abbey, was indeed that held for the ageing Queen Mother but marching servicemen were replaced by representatives of countless charities and great organisations, which this great icon of a mother had championed. And there in the centre, where in 1920 for the State Funeral of the Unknown Warrior the King Emperor, George V walked, were Diana's two boys. Men now, but boys then. And the impression upon crowd and world was intense. Ceremony and event are the servants of emotion, though sometimes they can tweak it. On 6 September 1997, as the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery and Welsh Guards Bearer Party stepped off from Kensington Palace, the global catharsis of mourning and healing began. In the seconds before going live to commentate the event, I thought much of the young girl whose father had been a school friend of my father's in the war. The young woman who had been friend to so many I knew. It was a grim duty, but to be a part of what was actually a striking and internationally profound event was a privilege. And the funeral ceremony itself was a conduit for every view, opinion, anger and sadness that boiled about the world. Twenty years on, some of these emotions still unsettle many, but the nation delivered Diana, Princess of Wales from an imperfect world into the peace of her Althrop island grave, perfectly."
