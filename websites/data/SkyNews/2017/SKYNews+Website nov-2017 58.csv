2017-11-01,A father and five children between the ages of four and 11 are understood to have died in a fire at a farmhouse in Powys.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/five-children-aged-between-four-and-11-and-man-die-in-powys-farmhouse-fire-11107059,"Dyfed-Powys Police said they were killed in the fire at the remote property at Llangammarch Wells, Powys when it broke out after midnight on Monday. Three other children aged 13, 12 and 10 managed to escape the blaze unharmed. The dead man has been named locally as David Cuthbertson and is thought to have been in his 60s. Superintendent Jon Cummins, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: ""Based on current information available to us, we are working on the hypothesis that one adult male and five children, aged between four and 11 years old, are unaccounted for and believed to be deceased within the house. ""Due to the severity of damage at the scene we are unable at this stage to identify any of the deceased."" Supt Cummins said the cause of the fire was being investigated, but at the moment it remained ""unexplained"". He added: ""Dyfed-Powys Police is continuing to investigate and deal with the tragic house fire that occurred at Poityn Farm, Llangammarch Wells, Powys, shortly after midnight on Monday October 30. ""Specialist scientists and fire investigators continue to assess the scene, which is very complex and perilous."" Fire and rescue search dogs and other fire brigade officials arrived to carry out investigations as flowers and tributes were left at the scene. One tribute said: ""Such a terrible tragedy, special thoughts to family and friends."" Family friend Barry Smith wrote on Facebook: ""The devastating news of the fire in Llangammarch Wells, I knew Dave for around 14 yrs... I can't & won't get over it....rest in peace Dave & all the little ones that died with you."" Writing on a JustGiving page set up in the wake of the blaze, Colin Ashton wrote: ""Very very sad. I knew David from the early 1990s when he was the main person to restore our barn in West Sussex. A really nice man and a real family man and an excellent builder."" Ron Birchall, 73, who lives in the village, said the father ""doted"" on his children and that he was separated from his partner, who moved away after suffering a stroke. He said: ""He was a great guy. All I can say is that he was a great father who loved his kids and doted on them."" Mr Cuthbertson, who lived in the area for decades, had around 17 children and lived with eight of them at the farmhouse, locals said. They said he had at least two further relationships following the end of his second marriage to his wife Judith, who now lives in Greece. Supt Cummins added: ""Our officers and all our partners such as the fire service are working in extremely challenging conditions and circumstances, and I thank them and commend them for their efforts. ""This is a tragic incident, and our deepest sympathies are with the family and all those affected."" County Councillor Tim Van-Rees, who represents the area, said the community was in shock. He said: ""I knew the family, not well, and I knew the father and several of the children. ""They were a large family, although I am not sure how many were living there. ""It is absolutely shocking and a devastating blow and it is possibly just as well we are in half-term at the moment because the effect on our children and the schools would have been very severe."""
2017-11-01,"An Army sergeant accused of tampering with his wife's parachute would have been financially worse off had she died, a court has heard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/parachute-tampering-trial-emile-cilliers-better-off-with-wife-victoria-alive-11107292,"Giving evidence at the Winchester Crown Court trial of Emile Cilliers, Victoria Cilliers agreed her husband was ""financially incontinent"" and had debt problems. However, wills and a post-nuptial agreement signed by the couple would not have benefited Cilliers if his wife had died, the court heard. The 42-year-old suffered multiple injuries when she plunged 4,000ft at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire in 2015. Cilliers denies attempted murder after being accused of tampering with his wife's parachute before she did the jump. Ex-Army officer Mrs Cilliers said they had signed a post-nuptial agreement in 2014 which set out their financial situation and how their assets would have been divided in the event of a divorce. She agreed with the suggestion by Elizabeth Mash QC, defending, that her husband had not challenged the drafting of the agreement or sought to get his name on the mortgage deed. Ms Marsh said: ""When you proposed this, did Emile say 'that's outrageous'?"" Mrs Cilliers replied: ""No, we discussed it, he admitted that money was potentially an issue and given we anticipated being married for life, it did not appear at that point to make a difference."" The defence counsel asked: ""He was not pushing back in any way against this decision of both of you to protect your assets from him?"" Mrs Cilliers replied: ""No, he was not."" Ms Marsh said the accused was helping Mrs Cilliers pay off a Â£45,000 loan from her brother, which she had borrowed because she could not get a mortgage, in return for a share of their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire. She asked: ""And this only subsists while you're alive does it not?"" Mrs Cilliers replied: ""Yes."" Ms Marsh said: ""Because if you die, the house and all your savings go to the children and he is on his uppers."" The physiotherapist responded: ""Yes."" Cilliers had also paid for life insurance, and Mrs Cilliers said she believed the payout on her death would go to her husband. But the insurance policy ""makes it plain"" payment would go to a legal representative or executor and not necessarily a spouse, Ms Marsh said, and continued: ""So if Emile had died during currency of this policy, money would have gone to his estate. ""Similarly, if you died, the money would not go to your husband it would go to your estate, did you know that?"" Mrs Cilliers replied ""no"", adding: ""I assumed wrongly it was most likely it went to him. ""I cannot recall a conversation with my solicitor, I think because I thought it went to Emile I left the house to the children (in the will) knowing he would get the life insurance money."" Ms Marsh asked: ""Does it come to this, putting the insurance money aside, Emile would have been better off with you alive than you dead, wouldn't he?"" She replied: ""Yes."" Cilliers, 37, denies two counts of attempted murder and a third charge of damaging a gas valve recklessly endangering life. The trial continues."
2017-11-01,"Downing Street says Theresa May ""has confidence in her Government and her ministers in getting on with the job"", amid claims of inappropriate behaviour at Westminster.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-says-she-has-confidence-in-government-amid-harassment-claims-11106940,"But her spokesman refused to say whether the Prime Minister had ""full confidence"" in Sir Michael Fallon after he apologised for touching a female journalist's knee. The Defence Secretary will not be investigated by the Cabinet Office over the incident however, as no complaint has been made, according to Number 10. When asked if Sir Michael had offered to resign, the spokesman said they did not want to get into ""running commentary, speculation"". It comes as allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against several MPs and ministers sweep Westminster. International trade minister Mark Garnier is already being investigated by the Cabinet Office over whether he breached the ministerial code when he asked his secretary to buy sex toys. : May reveals thousands of new Brexit jobs The PM's spokesman would not confirm whether any other ministers had been referred to the Cabinet Office. There are also questions as to what would happen if a backbench MP was accused of sexual harassment and cannot, therefore, be judged against the ministerial code. The Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow wrote to all MP staff members on Tuesday encouraging anybody who experiences or witnesses bullying or harassment ""of any kind"" to report it. He also admitted that ""current processes for dealing with this require review"" and said that the Commission was working on new ways to ""enable people to speak up without fear or favour"". A spreadsheet of the alleged inappropriate sexual activities of 40 MPs, including several Cabinet ministers, is currently being circulated by Conservative aides. The list, seen by Sky News, includes claims that some parliamentarians are ""handsy with women"" and ""inappropriate with female and male staff"". The Prime Minister has condemned all allegations of sexual impropriety in Westminster as ""completely unacceptable"". A whistle-blower helpline will be ""strengthened"" and told to recommend all serious allegations to police as a result of the accusations, the Government announced on Monday."
2017-11-01,"A damning new report into how the Hillsborough families were ""dehumanised"" has been published by the former Bishop of Liverpool.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/hillsborough-families-dehumanised-damning-report-into-stadium-tragedy-released-11108367,"The Rt Rev James Jones was asked to review relatives' experiences after the tragedy by Theresa May following the conclusions of the fresh inquests in April 2016. His 240-page report, 'The Patronising Disposition of Unaccountable Power', paints a shocking picture of how the families were treated by the authorities, police and media after the 1989 tragedy which killed 96 Liverpool fans. One family member revealed how their loved one's possessions were handed back by a police officer who tipped the contents onto a table, including a picture that had been taken after their death. One grieving mother told how a police officer told her to ""look again, love"" when she had been searching a notice board in Sheffield where Polaroid photos of the dead had been posted for identification to take place. :: Liverpool fans back safe standing areas in English football grounds ""Over the last two decades as I have listened to what the families have endured, a phrase has formed in my mind to describe what they have come up against whenever they have sought to challenge those in authority - 'the patronising disposition of unaccountable power',"" the Rt Rev Jones wrote. ""The Hillsborough families know that there are others who have found that when in all innocence and with a good conscience they have asked questions of those in authority on behalf of those they love, the institution has closed ranks, refused to disclose information, used public money to defend its interests and acted in a way that was both intimidating and oppressive."" :: Sombre but significant day for families of Hillsborough victims The report makes 25 recommendations, including the setting up of a charter for ""families bereaved through public tragedy"" and ""proper participation"" of bereaved families at inquests. It also calls for the establishment of a ""duty of candour"" to address unacceptable behaviour of police officers - serving or retired - who fail to cooperate fully with investigations into alleged criminal offences or misconduct."
2017-11-01,"Apple's chief executive describes the iPhone X as ""the future of smartphones"", but reviews are suggesting that this future is not imminent.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/has-apple-gone-too-far-for-999-iphone-x-to-be-a-success-11108185,"We already know that the iPhone X - pronounced 10 - features wireless charging, an infrared camera and improved battery life. We also know that it is going to be Apple's most expensive handset ever, setting consumers back Â£999 when it hits the shelves on Friday. But what we didn't know was how well its edge-to-edge screen would work, if its Face ID unlocking system would be accurate, and whether it could possibly be worth that much money. Many reviewers have complained about the limited time they had with the phone due to delayed deliveries - and all criticised the continued lack of a headphone jack, which was discontinued after the iPhone 6. Apps which aren't designed for the iPhone X leave the edge-to-edge screen looking odd, with the iOS autolayout feature meaning icons are blocked or obscured. A particular issue for US technology news network The Verge is the sensor housing at the top of the screen, which breaks the typical layout for iPhones of a perfect rectangular display. It would fall to the app developers to handle this display oddity, but when the apps worked the results were complimented by all reviewers. The iPhone X is Apple's first phone to use an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display rather than LCD and uses the technology to keep the screen's colours sharp. The edge-to-edge front means the iPhone X was set up to be billed as the most attractive smartphone ever made, but it fell short for The Verge, whose reviewer gave that title to the iPhone 4. The Telegraph went so far as to say the design took a backseat, despite the full screen being billed as an achievement for Apple's chief design officer Sir Jony Ive. Face ID worked for all of the reviewers, despite a wobble during the launch event which risked embarrassing the company. The biggest issue with Face ID, which uses infrared light to map users' faces and unlock the phone, was the difficulty of using it in bright environments. It was ""a little inconsistent"" in bright sunlight and in the presence of fluorescent light, reported The Verge, although Forbes claimed to find it worked well in bright light. For all this, Apple will be hoping the iPhone X launch on Friday will be less muted than that of the iPhone 8, for which a paltry 13 customers queued outside of its Regent Street store. Those rumoured supply demands will almost certainly play in Apple's favour come Friday morning when customers who have not pre-ordered a device will be queuing to pick one up in person."
2017-11-01,The widow of a murdered former Royal Navy Officer has described the âoverwhelming griefâ which has haunted her since his death.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/mike-samwells-killer-ryan-gibbons-jailed-for-27-years-11108271,"Jessica Samwell watched in horror as serial burglar, Ryan Gibbons ran over her husband Mike Samwell as he tried to stop him stealing his car. The couple were woken in April as Gibbons, 29, broke into their Â£450,000 house in Chorlton, south Manchester, snatching the keys to their Audi A3 sports car from the kitchen table. Gibbons claimed he didn't see Mike Samwell but heard ""screaming"" and thought, ""something had gone under the wheel"" before speeding off. Ahead of sentencing, Jessica Samwell read a poignant victim impact statement at Manchester Crown Court describing how her husband had been ""mindlessly and brutally killed."" She explained: ""It feels like no-one will ever understand. The last image I have of Mike lying on the ground, groaning in pain, holding his hand will stay with me for the rest of my life."" Breaking down at times she said that the memory of the night had left her with panic attacks and that she is unable to return to work or their family home. She said: ""There are no words that can truly express how the loss of Mike has affected me. ""I feel overwhelming grief for the future we will never have, the birthdays and anniversaries, and to think of the children we will never share is devastating. ""The loss of such a caring, loyal and warm man who supported me for 10 years is too much to bear. The hole he's left becomes even more tangible,"" she added. ""I now know the days get harder, the physical pain, loss and longing for Mike has not ended. The loss of Mike has felt catastrophic,"" she said. Sentencing father of four Ryan Gibbons, 29, to life in prison with a minimum of 27 years behind bars for murder, the judge rejected his account of what happened saying he deliberately ran over Mike Samwell. Mr Justice William Davis told Gibbons: ""You are a dangerous young man, you are a regular burglar and on this occasion, to get what you wanted, you quite ruthlessly killed a man."" Raymond Davies, 21, of Castlefield Walk, Manchester, who drove Gibbons and two other men, who have not been caught by police, to the address to steal the car, was sentenced to 8 years for manslaughter."
2017-11-01,"Britons should not be afraid of eating chlorinated chicken imported under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, Liam Fox has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/liam-fox-dont-be-afraid-of-us-chlorinated-chicken-after-brexit-11108663,"The International Trade Secretary insisted there are ""no health reasons"" why UK consumers should not enjoy chlorine-washed meat, if regulations on food produce are relaxed once Britain leaves the EU. Dr Fox has made striking a trade deal with the US one of his first priorities when ministers gain control of UK trade policy outside the EU. But this has led to fears British supermarkets will be flooded with goods produced using American farming practices, which often include methods banned by the EU. Appearing before the House of Commons' International Trade Committee, Dr Fox was asked by Tory MP and fellow Brexit supporter Nigel Evans about concerns over US-produced chicken. ""There are no health reasons why you couldn't eat chicken that had been washed in chlorinated water,"" Dr Fox said. ""Most of the salads in our supermarkets are rinsed in chlorinated water. ""In terms of reduction of campylobacter bacteria food poisoning, the US has - in general - much lower levels of campylobacter food poisoning than most countries in Europe."" He added: ""I have no objection to the British public being sold anything that is safe as long as they know what they are eating. ""I'm a great believer in giving the British public the choice over what they eat and as long as scientists tell us it's safe, then I think that should be our guiding principle."" Pressed on whether UK tourists should avoid eating chicken when they travel to the US, Dr Fox replied: ""No."" The Cabinet minister denied Britain is desperate for a trade deal with the US, insisting the Government would reject any agreement that was not in the UK's interests. ""If we were offered a deal we didn't think was to our advantage, we wouldn't take it, it wouldn't be a deal,"" he said. Earlier this year, it was reported the issue of whether to include agriculture in a possible post-Brexit trade deal with the US was the subject of a Cabinet rift. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has previously ruled out allowing US-produced chicken into Britain, as he insisted agricultural standards would not be reduced after Brexit. In his committee appearance, Dr Fox also accused the EU of acting like a ""gang"" over Brexit negotiations, suggesting an exit agreement that moved away from the current UK-EU relationship would be a ""political"" choice. He said: ""The language, which is regrettable, that some people want to punish Britain for leaving in case any other people would want to leave is the language of a gang and not the language of a club. ""In the longer-term it's in the interests of all EU citizens to maintain an open, liberal trading environment."" Commenting on Dr Fox's committee appearance, Labour MP Chris Leslie - a supporter of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign - accused the Brexit supporter of being ""disgracefully complacent about the prospect of a deal with the US leading to a flood of chlorinated chicken invading our supermarkets""."
2017-11-01,The Port of Dover is something of a gift for lazy journalists looking to do a report on the progress towards Brexit (or lack thereof).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/dover-and-out-niall-paterson-takes-in-the-brexit-views-11103770,"It's not just the seemingly limitless opportunities for terrible puns and tortured analogies - ""is the course set by Captain May leading us into a perfect storm"" *yawn* / ""(white) cliff edge Brexit"" *semi-avoided in my report* / ""clearish, blueish water between us and the EU"" - well, I did end up using that one. It's also that this staunchly pro-Brexit constituency is one of very few places that could, in a matter of moments after we officially leave the European Union, grind to a halt if a deal isn't struck, especially if we fail to adequately prepare for that outcome. The town, indeed the country, relies upon goods moving on and off those lorries with ease. And, even before we've left the EU, this part of the world can grind to a halt with a mere handful of cancelled Channel crossings. Little wonder then that as ""no deal"" has moved from being a topic of discussion among pointy-headed policy wonks in the corridors of power to a phrase muttered darkly over pints up and down the land that the local MP, the Tory Charlie Elphicke, has demanded action is taken to prepare for that eventuality. ""You can't know whether you're going to be able to end up with an agreement when you start a negotiation,"" he told me (on the white cliffs). ""We all want to see a really positive deal between Britain and Europe. We want to see a positive relationship in the future as we go out into the world. ""But nevertheless we can't guarantee a deal, and that's why we need to be ready on day one, deal or no deal."" That's why he has demanded the Treasury includes in the next Budget a billion pounds to prepare for leaving before agreement. No word yet on whether they agree. But take a guess. Some apparently influential commentators have suggested that if we start spending massive sums of money then that's the point that we will see large companies, and their tax take, leave the UK for pastures new. Certainly it's a risk. I'd say it's more likely that there will be capital spend on their part that they'd rather avoid, and perhaps there will be some significant overtures towards securing new continental HQs, and an anxious wait and see if there's progress. But if ""no deal"" remains on the table, surely it follows that we prepare for it? A more pertinent point in the context of Dover is that there is clearly a growing sense of frustration at the lack of progress in the UK/EU talks; and, concomitant to that, a diminution of the regard in which those negotiating are held. People who gladly queued up to vote Conservative now eagerly wait in line to criticise their strategy. It's all grinding to a halt, they told me. Theresa May is just desperate for a deal at any cost. Some even suggested that a combination of Labour and some Tory MPs were trying to wreck the process. It's clear that's by no means a majority opinion - despite the grumblings about the negotiations, those we spoke to generally believed our exit from the EU was going to happen, and some were remarkably sanguine about the prospect of no deal. But notice how the conversation is shifting. Transition is no longer a dirty word among even the most Brexity of Brexiteers. There's acceptance of the Commons getting a vote on the deal. Supporters of Brexit, once defined by their understandable triumphalism, are beginning to complain of establishment stitch-ups, of connivance between Remoaners in government and the opposition, and those most concerned now fear that we may stay in the EU rather longer than expected. Which of course raises the question of a second referendum. Given how the debate has progressed, the incremental detail added to both the UK's negotiating position and the Opposition's favoured negotiating strategy, is it really that unthinkable that at some stage people begin to consider it openly? My guess? Not entirely unthinkable, but certainly not any time soon. Labour of course has its own presentational problems given how many of its voters chose to leave, especially if the public perception grows that they are wreckers and not scrutineers. Still, there is but one politician who has tied their future, both short and long term, to the Brexit process. Theresa May understands better than most the nature of negotiations and the negative press that invariably emerges when neither side is (entirely understandably) willing to be entirely candid as to how discussions are proceeding. But her majority is paper thin; and that paper has pictures of the Queen printed upon it. A jolly (Sir Ivan) Roger? Waving not drowning? Sinking or swimming? Treading water awaiting rescue? Hey May, Mayday, M'aider? Tortuous the puns and analogies may be. So too these Brexit negotiations."
2017-11-01,Women who have survived rape and sexual violence are still being sent to immigration detention centres despite recent guidelines advising against it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/refugee-yarls-wood-detention-centre-was-like-room-where-i-was-raped-11108023,"The charity Women for Refugee Women interviewed 26 women who had spent time in detention. They found 22 were victims of sexual and gender-based violence, and most had been detained for at least a month. Last year the Government introduced new guidance to cut the number of vulnerable people being sent to detention centres. The 'Adults at Risk' policy states individuals at risk should not be detained, including those who have been ""a victim of sexual or gender based violence, including female genital mutilation"". One of the women in detention was Vivian, who escaped to the UK from West Africa, after her husband forced her into prostitution. She believed a new life in Britain would be better, but instead spent six months this year in the notorious Yarl's Wood detention centre, even though immigration officials agreed she was ""at risk"". She told Sky News her story: I was homeless from the age of 10. I was driven out of my house because they said I was a witch. Then I met a guy and I told him everything, that I didn't have any family - I trusted him and married him. It turned out to be my worst dream. He started abusing me and using me for prostitution. I'd just go to work and come back and he would lock me in a room and then he would force men to have sex with me. And it was like that until I met somebody that encouraged me to go to the police. I didn't want to go because I know the police are corrupt. And when I came back that was just the beginning of another trend of torture. They beat me so much that they thought I had died or was about to die. Later, a customer saw me and noticed that I was depressed. She encouraged me to relocate to another country and I came to the UK. But when I was in Yarl's Wood detention centre, it was just like I was in that room where men came in and forced me to have sex. It's a confined space and I was afraid of being in a confined space. I was suicidal, I was depressed and it was very traumatic. I wasn't sleeping - I was having flashbacks because of the memories that happened to me in that room. I felt like I was caged in again. I only went to the room when I knew it was absolutely necessary because it reminded me of what happened to me back home. My roommate was always screaming at night as it was bringing her back to what happened to her in her country. They placed me on a watchlist and came to see me every 24 hours because the lady knew that I was suicidal after what happened to me. Still, they said that they would not release me. It was a very bad experience, very traumatic and very depressing."

Mr Erlij, a 48-year-old businessman and steel mill owner, paid for the costs of the trip for some of his friends so they could make the class of 1987 reunion in the Big Apple, according to media reports in Argentina. :: What we know about NY terror attack suspect Didier Reynders, Belgium's foreign minister, said a Belgian woman, from Roeselare, who was in New York with her sister and mother was also among those killed. ""I am deeply saddened to announce a Belgian victim in #Manhattan - I express my condolences to the family and friends,"" he wrote on Twitter. The other two victims remain unidentified. :: 'Hero cop risked his life' to shoot suspect The attack happened a short distance from the World Trade Center memorial, the site of the 9/11 terror attack in 2001, the deadliest in US history.

2017-11-01,"Doctors in Folkestone have warned patient safety is at risk because of a GP shortage that has seen one surgery close this week, with seven other practices telling officials they are too full to take any more patients.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/doctors-warn-patients-are-in-danger-as-gp-shortage-forces-clinic-to-close-11108837,"The Folkestone East surgery closed on Tuesday with more than 25% of its 4,700 patients, many of them extremely vulnerable, yet to be allocated a place with an alternative doctor. Local GPs say the Kent town has 16 fewer GPs than it needs, and warn remaining surgeries are ""on their knees"". The situation has left doctors in revolt against the local health authority. Earlier this year, GPs at seven practices told the South Kent Coast Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) that they want to close their lists to new patients. The CCG, which has to give permission, refused, and instead effectively forced surgeries to accept new patients through a system of allocation, where places are determined centrally. The surgery says 1,900 patients have still not been found places, while the CCG says it is only 1,300. Doctors say the GP shortage is compromising the level of care they can provide and that the CCG refused to accept that many patients, including some with cancer, mental health conditions and substance dependencies, should be prioritised. The British Medical Association (BMA) told Sky News the position in Folkestone reflects an acute shortage of doctors in primary care across the country. The Folkestone East surgery closed following the retirement of two GPs and a third leaving the area. Despite trying to recruit replacements in the UK and abroad for more than a year, the practice did not have a single application. Dr Vanessa Goodall, a partner at the practice, said it left them with no choice but to close. ""We tried [to recruit] for over a year both in this country and abroad, and didn't get a single applicant. Not one,"" she said. ""Only a couple of years ago there would have been 20 plus replies to that advertisement and we would have to run a couple of days of interviews. There are just no GPs available now, everyone is working to their maximum capacity."" Dr Goodall said patients had been upset by the closure and care may suffer as patients lose their connection with their family doctor. She added: ""We've already seen the impact, the level of stress and distress we've seen in the last six months I never want to see again. Many of our patients are fearful, really fearful for the future. ""I personally feel that they are going to practices with experienced GPs, but those practices are already full and bulging at the seams. To continue to provide care to 500 or 1,000 new patients overnight, who they've never met, is a tall ask."" To be allocated a new doctor, patients had to fill in and return a nine-page form that is processed under contract by Capita at offices in Preston. They are then assigned a doctor and have to visit the surgery to register. South Kent Coast CCG said 1,300 people are yet to return the form and will receive reminders. Dr Goodall said the surgery asked the CCG to automatically allocate all 4,700 patients but it refused. Doctors and the CCG have also disagreed about the definition of vulnerable patients. The surgery said 2,320 patients should be prioritised, but the CCG calculated that only 1,143 qualified. The surgery said those left off their list included those with diabetes, cancer, HIV, heroin and cocaine addiction, and some who have made recent suicide attempts. Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the BMA's GPs committee, said: ""The pressures that GP practices in Folkestone are a reflection of a huge workload pressures that practices are experiencing right around the country. ""We're seeing reports of practices under pressure right around the country and that's because of a decade of underfunding, a difficulty recruiting new GPs and many practices feeling that the service that they are offering to patients is at risk of not being safe enough."" In a statement, South Kent Coast CCG said: ""The vast majority of Folkestone East patients have been successfully allocated to another local GP practice. We would encourage any remaining patients to complete and return their allocation form as soon as possible so that we can assign them to a new surgery."" A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""We understand the pressures GPs face as demand increases and our population ages - that's why we are investing an extra Â£2.4bn in GP surgeries over the next three years. ""But it is imperative that communities have access to their local surgeries, and we would urge GPs to consider the impact closing their lists would have on the wellbeing of their patients."""
2017-11-01,A senior Tory MP has suggested Damian Green should stand down from his Cabinet role while he is investigated over allegations he behaved inappropriately towards a female journalist.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/senior-tory-suggests-green-should-stand-down-amid-harassment-claims-11108233,"Former Conservative minister Anna Soubry told Sky News it is ""a matter for him"" whether or not the First Secretary of State, who is effectively Theresa May's deputy, continues to serve in Government. But the Broxtowe MP claimed outside of politics, allegations of impropriety resulting in an investigation would lead to an employee's suspension. She said: ""It is an allegation that he denies so I think it is very important that we don't have trial by media. ""In my opinion, it is actually quite a serious allegation and it is a matter for him as to whether or not he continues in his office whilst that investigation is up and running and until findings are made. ""In other organisations you would be suspended. ""Now sometimes that's actually quite unjust and people feel greatly aggrieved by that, especially when they are completely exonerated from any allegation. ""But, I think my point is this, those of us in politics, those of us who also work in Parliament, we should be subjected to exactly the same standards, practices and procedures, disciplinary-type results for all of that, as anybody else in any other organisation or business."" Ms Soubry added: ""Why should we be different just because we are politicians, or MPs, or members of Government or the Cabinet? ""There's a good argument our standards should be higher than what we expect from other people."" The Conservative backbencher said she would not tell the Prime Minister what to do in the face of the allegations against Mr Green, but suggested Mrs May ""will be robust in this and she must be robust"" as a sexual harassment scandal engulfs Westminster. On Tuesday, the most serious claims emerged as a Labour activist revealed she was discouraged from reporting a rape allegation by a party official. Ms Soubry said she couldn't be confident Bex Bailey would have been treated any differently had she been a Conservative aide. ""I don't think any political party has taken these things in the serious way they should have done,"" she said. Prominent Labour MP Jess Phillips said sexual harassment was ""inevitable"" in Westminster, telling Sky News: ""It's a place where power and control play a huge role and there are hundreds if not thousands of people wanting to make their way in the world. ""That is potentially a toxic environment."" The Birmingham Yardley MP accused the PM of failing to show leadership over the scandal, as she questioned why Tory MP Stephen Crabb had not had action taken against him after he apologised for sending explicit messages to a 19-year-old woman. Mrs Phillips also claimed those who have branded the scandal as ""hysteria"" or a ""witch hunt"" are ""delegitimising"" the voices of women. The Prime Minister has referred allegations against Mr Green to the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to ""establish the facts"". The accusations, made in The Times by freelance columnist Kate Maltby, have been strongly denied by Mr Green who has instructed libel lawyers over the allegations. He said: ""It is absolutely and completely untrue that I've ever made any sexual advances on Ms Maltby."" Separately, International Trade minister Mark Garnier is being investigated over a possible breach of ministerial rules after he admitted asking a former aide to buy sex toys."
2017-11-01,"An expected Bank of England interest rate rise will have only a ""modest"" impact on mortgage borrowers, the UK' s biggest building society said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/rate-hike-will-have-modest-impact-on-mortgages-says-nationwide-11108306,"Nationwide said fewer homeowners in the past would be affected, as the vast majority taking new loans now opt for fixed rate deals. Those with mortgages linked to the Bank rate now represent a record low of 40%, down from a peak of 70% in 2001. But it still means two in five home borrowers face a typical Â£15 rise in monthly repayments, or Â£180 a year, at a time when a squeeze in real terms wages has seen them fall to their lowest levels since 2005. That will happen if as expected policy makers opt for a 0.25 percentage point hike this week - which would be the first increase in a decade. The rise is opposed by some experts as economic growth remains sluggish and a squeeze on consumer incomes could be exacerbated by higher borrowing costs. But Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ""Providing labour market conditions do not weaken significantly, the impact of a small rate rise on most UK households is likely to be modest. ""That's not to say the rise will be welcome news for many borrowers. ""Household budgets are under pressure from the fact that wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. ""Indeed, in real terms (i.e. after adjusting for inflation) wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005."" The comments came as Nationwide said UK house price growth had edged up to an annual rate of 2.5% last month - though the outlook for the market remained subdued. Prices rose 0.2% month on month, the building society said. Mr Gardner said low mortgage rates and healthy levels of employment growth were supporting demand while prices were also being pushed up by a lack of homes on the market. However, pressure on household incomes appeared to be weighing on confidence. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said he was sceptical about the prospects of an upturn in the housing market. He said it remained ""under pressure from squeezed consumer purchasing power, fragile confidence and appreciable caution over engaging in major transactions"". ""A likely Bank of England interest rate hike on Thursday may very well also weigh down on housing market activity,"" he added."
2017-11-01,What is it about fixed-odds terminals that makes some people lose thousands of pounds in minutes?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171101195725/http://news.sky.com/story/fixed-odds-betting-addict-in-his-own-words-i-just-self-destruct-11106617,"As the Government says the maximum stake is to be reduced from Â£100 to between Â£2 and Â£50, a man struggling with his addiction to the machines shares his story. This is James Lowe's story, in his own words. :: I'm an addict I think about using the machines all the time. Every day. Several times a day. Twenty minutes ago. It's just there all the time. I'm always thinking, 'What if I can win that Â£2,000 jackpot in 4 minutes?' I don't think about what if I lose that Â£200 in a few minutes and can't eat for the next two weeks. :: Biggest loss The worst it's ever got was when I lost Â£5,000 in 65 minutes. I was just in, in, in. Cash, debit card everything. I couldn't stop. I was getting angry. After about Â£2,000 the guy behind the counter kept stopping the machine saying to calm down or he would kick me out. I said, 'That's what I want, I physically can't stop myself. You need to step in and stop me because I can't.' He didn't and by the end of it my knuckles were bleeding because I'd been banging the buttons so hard. :: First contact  I first came across the machines in around 2008. They used to have normal fruit machines in bookmakers and I remember that they started getting these screen machines in and I thought, 'These are nice, this is different, there's a lot of different games you can play'. The first few months I thought, 'This is good', but then it just spiralled out of control within a couple of months. I just started wasting more and more. :: Why they're so addictive? It's the quick wins. The amount of money that you can win so quickly, it's pretty crazy. I've walked into a bookies with Â£10 and literally within 15 minutes I've won nearly Â£2,500. It's that quick. But then on the flipside, you can lose Â£2,000 in an hour if not more if you're doing the maximum Â£100 bets.:: What it feels like to lose so much money When I lose, I hate it. I've been suicidal, I've got angry and violent and abusive. I don't care when I'm in that zone, I don't care what's going on around me or who's around me, it doesn't matter who's there if it's family, friends or whatever. I'll just deliberately self-destruct.:: How to stop the addiction Personally, I'd like to see these gambling machines banned from bookmakers altogether, but if that's not possible I'd like them to reduce the stake down from Â£100 to Â£5 or Â£2 and also bring the jackpot down as well. It's the only way. If the jackpot is still high, people will still do it. ::The Association of British Bookmakers said in a statement: ""Betting shops cater for over 6 million customers every year and the vast majority of them gamble responsibly. ""The average amount lost on a betting shop gaming machine in a session is just Â£9.17. ""We know that most problem gamblers use seven or more different types of gambling products, therefore there is a challenge for the whole gambling industry to move from a position where there is a stable level of problem gambling in this country to one where problem gambling rates are decreasing. ""Betting shops are investing very significant sums of money to help identify those at risk so that they get the help that they need. ""And an independent review of betting shops' self-exclusion scheme found that 83% of participants agree that it has been effective in reducing or stopping their gambling activity. We are continually updating and working to improve this scheme."""

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Nandy said: ""I brought that information to her in this House and I warned her at the time that unless real action was taken we risked repeating those injustices again today. ""On three occasions I asked her to act and on three occasions she did not. ""So can I ask her - in this of all weeks, for the fourth time, will she finally take concrete action to tackle this?"" Ms Nandy also tweeted a question she asked Mrs May in July 2014, about the child sex abuse insuiry. In it, she highlighted the claim by an ex-Tory whip made in a 1995 documentary that his office routinely helped MPs with scandals, including those ""involving small boys"", during the 1970s. Mrs May responded on Wednesday by promising to ""look back"" at the interventions. 3 yrs ago, I asked Theresa May to act on evidence that Whips had covered up sexual misconduct. Today at #PMQs I asked her again to act. pic.twitter.com/NBl0iwyJK3 She said: ""I will say to her that I am very clear that the whips office - I hope this goes for all whips offices across this House - should make clear to people that where there are any sexual abuse allegations that could be of a criminal nature that people should go to the police. ""It is not appropriate for those to be dealt with by whips offices - those should go to the police. ""That continues to be the case."" Downing Street insisted that Mrs May had responded to Ms Nandy's questions, because the role of political parties had been included within the terms of reference of the child sex abuse inquiry. ""The matters raised were dealt with,"" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. It comes as a series of fresh sex assault and harassment claims brew in Westminster. A whistle-blower helpline will be ""strengthened"" and told to recommend all serious allegations to police as a result, the Government announced on Monday."

Their investigation will also probe the activities of a firm called Better for the Country Limited (BFTCL), of which Mr Banks is a director, as well as the recipients of funds from both BFTCL and Mr Banks. Mr Banks registered as a permitted participant with the Electoral Commission and gave three loans totalling Â£6m to the Leave.EU campaign group he jointly founded during the referendum campaign. It made Mr Banks, who has also bankrolled UKIP, the biggest funder to the Brexit campaign. BFTCL was not registered as a permitted participant in the EU referendum, with five registered campaigners reporting donations totalling nearly Â£2.4m from the company, according to the Electoral Commission. Their investigation will look at whether or not BFTCL was the true source of donations made to campaigners or if it was acting as an agent; and whether or not Mr Banks was the true source of loans reported by a referendum campaigner in his name. Bob Posner, the Electoral Commission's director of political finance and regulation and legal counsel, said: ""Interest in the funding of the EU referendum campaigns remains widespread. ""Questions over the legitimacy of funding provided to campaigners at the referendum risks causing harm to voters' confidence. ""It is therefore in the public interest that the Electoral Commission seeks to ascertain whether or not impermissible donations were given to referendum campaigners and if any other related offences have taken place."" The Electoral Commission is already conducting a separate investigation into Leave.EU's spending return from the EU referendum campaign. In response to the investigation, Mr Banks told Sky News: ""This is a politically motivated decision - all of the financing was UK-based and above board. He added: ""I have no confidence in the Electoral Commission which is not up to the job. ""This should be a judge-led inquiry and overseen by Parliament. ""They would do be better to look at the funding behind the official Vote Leave and Remain campaigns."" Mr Banks also posted on Twitter: ""Gosh I'm terrified."" Last week, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw told Parliament there was ""widespread public concern about foreign, particularly Russian, interference in western democracies"". He urged the Government and the Electoral Commission to examine reports over ""the role of dark money in the EU referendum"" and ""the real wealth of Arron Banks"". Mr Banks told Sky News: ""My only involvement with the Russians was a six hour lunch with the Russian ambassador. I had a great time."""

Speaker John Bercow said he ""expects"" the Government to respect the decision - despite confusion over whether the result is binding. Opposition Day debate motions are traditionally non-binding, but Labour had tabled a special ""Humble Address"" motion. It is a centuries-old and infrequently used procedure that asks the Queen directly to request documents from the Government. Mr Bercow had only advised: ""Motions of this kind have in the past been seen as effective or binding."" He warned ministers could be in ""contempt"" of Parliament if they ignore the call. Afterwards, SNP MP Peter Grant said: ""Today's debate at Westminster was an utter shambles - and clearly the Tories are in a total panic about these secret papers.

It has published plans to reduce so-called interchange fees charged to card issuers from 25p to 20p per withdrawal, over the next four years. But Ron Delnevo, executive director of the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA), said thousands of free-to-use cash machines could go - with some starting to charge customers and others disappearing completely. LINK said there would still be an extensive network of free cash machines and that any reduction would likely be in areas where there are currently a number of them close together. It said the number of cashpoints was at near-record levels, with more than 70,000 across the country, of which 80% are free to use. LINK chief executive John Howells said: ""Free access to cash is vital for UK consumers and LINK intends to maintain this for many years to come."" But the network pointed to figures from UK Finance predicting that over the next 10 years, the number of cash payments would fall by 43% to 8.7 billion payments. Mr Delnevo said there were 22,000 independently operated free-to-use machines, many of them already operating very efficiently. ""These kind of cuts will make a lot of these services uneconomical,"" he told Sky News. ""In theory, all of these are at risk."" He rejected the idea that machines would only be lost in areas that were already well served - citing as an example high streets that have a number of bank branches, which he said were unlikely to close their machines. Mr Delnevo was also sceptical about the idea that Britain is heading for a cashless society - pointing to data showing that three quarters of transactions in convenience stores are still made using cash. The ATMIA said cash remained a vital part of the economy and many people, especially the most vulnerable, depended on free access to it."

Mr Brokenshire also revealed he was taking legal advice on whether MLA - members of the Assembly - should keep being paid while deadlock remains. But he said any interventions by Westminster should not be seen as a reason by both main parties to abandon negotiations.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who has has been involved in the discussions, said the British government was reluctantly imposing a budget and had held off doing so for as long as possible. ""Both governments share the view that it is regrettable and deeply concerning that, eight months after the last Assembly election, a powersharing Executive is not in place to make the necessary decisions, including on budgetary issues, for Northern Ireland,"" he said. Mr Coveney added: ""The Irish government, working with the British government, has spared no effort in supporting and facilitating these talks over many months but the issue at the heart of this is the relationship between the parties. ""The issues under discussion - particularly those on language and culture - go to the heart of the divisions in society here in Northern Ireland and so agreement on them was always going to be very challenging. ""However, I have always believed that it is possible to reach an honourable compromise which reflects the core principles of the Agreement - partnership, equality and mutual respect."""

""It seems the only requirement was to be a male under the age of 30 for Mr Spacey to feel free to touch us,"" the Mexican actor wrote. ""I also had a couple of unpleasant encounters with Spacey which were on the verge of being called harassment,"" he added. :: Peter Tatchell: Spacey's gayness is irrelevant now Cavazos, who also appeared in Doctor Who, wrote the post to denounce similar issues in Mexican theatre, but took the opportunity to discuss accusations made by actor Anthony Rapp regarding Spacey. ""There are many of us [actors] with a 'Spacey story',"" he wrote. Cavazos also said that he knows many people ""which have told me the same story"", where ""Spacey would invite them to meet with him to talk about their careers"". :: Is a House of Cards spinoff a good idea? He said his experience involved ""a picnic with champagne at the set"", adding that had happened to others as well. ""Each story varied in terms of how far the picnic went, but his technique was the same,"" he added. Cavazos, who acted in three plays at the Old Vic during Spacey's tenure as artistic director, said Spacey also tried to do that to him twice, but he never let him. ""But I know of some who feared stepping up."" :: Is Kevin Spacey using his sexuality as a PR spin? The Old Vic theatre said it was ""deeply dismayed"" by the allegations against Spacey, adding ""no complaints"" had been made towards the actor during his time there or after he had left. It added in a statement: ""We aim to foster a safe and supportive environment without prejudice, harassment or bullying of any sort, at any level, as set out in our joint statement with the theatre industry on 23 October. ""We want our employees to feel confident, valued and proud to be part of The Old Vic family. Any behaviour we become aware of which contravenes these goals will not be tolerated."" Following the allegations, Spacey issued an apology to Anthony Rapp, saying he did not recall the incident, and revealing he was ""now living as a gay man"". The statement has been widely criticised by both his Hollywood peers and the gay community, and Netflix has since halted production of his show House Of Cards before the final season. Sky News has approached Spacey's representatives for comment but have not received an answer."

Sky Germany is behind the Â£25m eight-part drama series and filming gets under way this week in the French seaside town of La Rochelle. The naval base that the Nazis built using slave labour in the 1940s still stands, thanks largely to the 8m-thick reinforced concrete that they used. ""This is an absolutely perfect location because the producers don't need to change anything,"" said French historian Herve Sinquin, who is working as a historical adviser on the project. ""This was where the Germans were based for five years and they built that structure to protect their U-boats. ""This stretch of Atlantic coast was hugely important to the German navy, so that's why they put so much effort into ensuring it couldn't be bombed. And it was bombed, but it withstood those Allied bombardments."" La Rochelle was one of the last French towns to be liberated from Nazi control and the residents here are curious to see how the producers will take their famous harbour and coastline back to some of the darkest days in French history. The 1981 Wolfgang Petersen Das Boot film was nominated for six Oscars and is widely regarded as the most important German film ever made. ""It had a huge impact all around the world,"" said producer Holger Reibiger, who is working on the new series. ""People watched that movie and saw that German cinema had something, it put us on the map. So yes, there's a big responsibility taking on a project of this scale, especially given the name and the history attached to it. ""Germans will watch this and no doubt they will compare, that is real pressure. I really hope we can do it justice. ""We have German stars, French stars and American stars in the cast, but if you ask me, the real star is the actual U-boat itself."" The boat measures 67m and was shipped to western France from a base in Malta this week. Das Boot will be broadcast in the autumn of 2018."

However, the site's traditional Aboriginal owners, the Anangu, consider the rock sacred and believe it should be respected. The Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park board voted unanimously on Wednesday to bring an end to climbing, with the ban coming into force in October 2019. Speaking to state broadcaster ABC, board chairman Sammy Wilson said the site was ""an extremely important place, not a playground or theme park like Disneyland"". In a statement, Mr Wilson said: ""The land has law and culture. We welcome tourists here. Closing the climb is not something to feel upset about but a cause for celebration. Let's come together; let's close it together. ""If I travel to another country and there is a sacred site, an area of restricted access, I don't enter or climb it, I respect it. It is the same here for Anangu. We are not stopping tourism, just this activity."" The board had set three preconditions for closing the climb, including seeing climber numbers drop to less than 20% of visitors, which officials say has now happened. Locals have long asked tourists not to climb the site out of respect for the Anangu and their land, and photography is banned in some parts. The rock holds cultural significance to Anangu, who believe it was formed by ancestral beings. Director of National Parks Sally Barnes said there were ""many alternative activities on place on the ground that people can enjoy instead of climbing"". ""This includes experiencing Uluru's culture - for which we're World-Heritage listed,"" she said. ""This is a significant moment for all Australians and marks a new chapter in our history. It clearly says we put country and culture first."""

Among the 470,000 or so files - the fourth collection to be made public by the US - were videos such as children's films Antz and Cars along with games such as Final Fantasy VII. There were three documentaries on the computer about bin Laden - one was called Where in the World is Osama bin Laden. His son's wedding video was also among the collection. Some of the material has not been released due to fears of breaching national security, the files were corrupted, or because they were pornographic. CIA director Mike Pompeo said: ""Today's release of recovered al Qaeda letters, videos, audio files and other materials provides the opportunity for the American people to gain further insights into the plans and workings of this terrorist organisation. ""CIA will continue to seek opportunities to share information with the American people consistent with our obligation to protect national security."" The release also includes 18,000 documents, including bin Laden's journal, about 79,000 audio and image files and more than 10,000 videos. The CIA said the material gave an insight into the differences between al Qaeda and Islamic State. It said they also revealed disagreements within the group and its allies and the problems it faced at the time of the death of its leader. Thomas Joscelyn and Bill Roggio, of think tank Defence of Democracies, were allowed to study the trove before it was made public. Mr Roggio said: ""These documents will go a long way to help fill in some of the blanks we still have about al Qaeda's leadership."""

But he picked up an acetone-free bottle of nail varnish remover, rather than hydrogen peroxide, when shopping for chemical ingredients at an Asda store in Derby, the Old Bailey has been told. Mohammed, a Sudanese immigrant, is said to have quickly formed an ""emotional attachment and shared ideology"" with fellow divorcee El-Hassan. While the pair dated, between Derby and London, Mohammed allegedly made contact with an Islamic State commander and volunteered to carry out a terror attack in Britain. A jury was shown footage from the supermarket, where Mohammed is said to have spoken to El-Hassan on the phone about what to buy. She sent him a link to a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, the court heard. Anne Whyte, prosecuting, told jurors Mohammed's till receipt showed he had bought a Sally Hansen acetone-free nail remover instead. The prosecution alleges he saw the word 'acetone' and assumed he was buying a TATP explosive component. A week later, he allegedly visited Ace Discounts in Derby and looked at pressure cookers, which the prosecution said could contain explosives. Mohammed was arrested on December 12. The court was told that in a search of his home, police found two of the three components of TATP - hydrogen peroxide in a wardrobe, and a bottle of hydrochloric acid in the freezer. In London, a police search at El-Hassan's home found an unopened bottle of high percentage instant drain cleaner containing sulphuric acid, which can be used to make explosives, alongside disposable face masks, jurors were told. Mohammed told police he had planned to clean his car alloys with the hydrochloric acid and had been advised by El-Hassan to use hydrogen peroxide to treat a burn. Mohammed, 36, from Derby, and El-Hassan, 33, from northwest London, deny preparing terrorist acts between November 2015 and December 2016."

He was given around Â£12,500 in money and possessions from charities and the local council - but actually lived miles away in southeast London. The 52-year-old - who has 28 previous convictions - was pictured next to Prince Charles when he visited a memorial wall near the tower in the weeks after the fire. Nguyen told the media - including Sky News - that he had escaped from the 15th floor with his 12-year-old son and wife. He said the blaze had destroyed ""everything"" he owned and appeared distressed as he described escaping from the tower, and the deaths of his loved ones. Nguyen said he had become separated from them and recounted seeing dead bodies in the hallways as he fought his way out of the building with a wet towel for protection. He claimed to have spent two nights in the Westway centre, set up for survivors, and that he was trying to get family over from Hong Kong for his wife and son's funeral. However, two days after Prince Charles' visit, Nguyen was arrested, and has now pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation. He has also admitted one count of making an untrue statement for the purpose of obtaining a passport. Nguyen, of Beckenham in southeast London, showed no emotion as he entered the pleas at Southwark Crown Court. His lies were discovered after he gave several different flat numbers - some of which did not exist and one where a real victim had lived. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay previously told the court that Nguyen had ""applied for Â£5,000 and gave his address as flat 18 Grenfell Tower, but there is no flat 17 or 18"". Vietnam-born Nguyen has been in the UK since the 1980s and has 28 other convictions for offences such as grievous bodily harm, arson and theft. He also has 17 aliases. Judge Philip Bartle called Nguyen's actions ""despicable"". He said: ""This defendant succeeded in achieving money out of the misery and tragedy of people who... genuinely suffered by this terrible fire."" Nguyen will be sentenced next month."

He will be taken straight to the Mountbatten Suite on the fifth floor for an operational briefing - a rundown of the global footprint of Britain's Armed Forces. This will be delivered by the Chief of the Defence Staff if he is in the country, otherwise one of his deputies will stand in. The room can connect to bases around the world using video conferencing. Mr Williamson will be brought up to speed on the whereabouts of the UK's nuclear deterrent, Special Forces deployments and other highly sensitive missions. It's about now that the new Secretary of State will be making an internal decision: to let the machine take him along or to rebel and do his own thing. :: May picks Fallon replacement after resignation It is a daunting few hours and requires the confidence of an assured politician. No other department has such a tricky mix of civil servants, politicians and the military. ""The MOD is a hard place to land initially,"" one former insider who oversaw the welcome of a previous Defence Secretary told me. Mr Williamson will have precious little time to get across his new brief. Next Wednesday and Thursday, NATO Defence Ministers meet in Brussels; on Friday his US counterpart James Mattis is stopping in London for bilateral talks; on Sunday, he will represent the Armed Forces when at the Cenotaph on Whitehall on Remembrance Sunday. Mix into that a concluding National Security Review that could see hundreds of Royal Marines cut and the loss of the UK's amphibious capabilities - he won't have long to influence the outcome. It is a demanding job which can require decisions of genuine life and death. His schedule will require a lot of foreign travel and countless ceremonial events. Balancing political demands with military needs will often seem impossible; the scrutiny will at times be intense, but it is a fantastic job, one that few don't grow to love. My advice to Gavin Williamson is this: don't try to be the military's friend - there are just too many competing divisions - but listen to what they advise, show them you take your job and theirs seriously, fight for them in public if not always in private, and you will earn their respect."

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Nandy said: ""I brought that information to her in this House and I warned her at the time that unless real action was taken we risked repeating those injustices again today. ""On three occasions I asked her to act and on three occasions she did not. ""So can I ask her - in this of all weeks, for the fourth time, will she finally take concrete action to tackle this?"" Ms Nandy also tweeted a question she asked Mrs May in July 2014, about the child sex abuse insuiry. In it, she highlighted the claim by an ex-Tory whip made in a 1995 documentary that his office routinely helped MPs with scandals, including those ""involving small boys"", during the 1970s.

""It is not appropriate for those to be dealt with by whips offices - those should go to the police. ""That continues to be the case."" Downing Street insisted that Mrs May had responded to Ms Nandy's questions, because the role of political parties had been included within the terms of reference of the child sex abuse inquiry. ""The matters raised were dealt with,"" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. It comes as a series of fresh sex assault and harassment claims brew in Westminster. A whistle-blower helpline will be ""strengthened"" and told to recommend all serious allegations to police as a result, the Government announced on Monday."

Gibbons claimed he didn't see Mike Samwell but heard ""screaming"" and thought, ""something had gone under the wheel"" before speeding off. Ahead of sentencing, Jessica Samwell read a poignant victim impact statement at Manchester Crown Court describing how her husband had been ""mindlessly and brutally killed.""

""I think it would be worth reflecting whether there were others that were more experienced and suitable for that role,"" she told the BBC. Dr Wollaston suggested Mr Williamson's position as a close ally of the Prime Minister played a part in his appointment.

Once the new MSPs had been sworn in, she said: ""I want to start with the words that I have always wanted either to say or to hear someone else say - the Scottish Parliament, which adjourned on March 25, 1707, is hereby reconvened."" There was a fitting symmetry to this because the modern phase of the campaign for Scottish self-government had begun with her victory in the 1967 Hamilton by-election. She overturned a Labour majority of 16,000. Until then, the SNP had only ever won a seat in the exceptional circumstances of wartime. Hamilton was the big breakthrough and they have been continuously represented at Westminster ever since. Back in 1967, George Reid was a reporter for Scottish Television. He said: ""Winnie was an articulate, very presentable young woman at the time. ""There was an enormously dedicated SNP campaign and a pretty derelict Labour machine that thought they had the seat for life. I thought there was a 50/50 chance she might do it."" He recalled: ""I remember shouting, 'She's done it' as the result came in."" Mrs Ewing's son Fergus, now a Scottish Government minister, was just 10-years-old when his mother shocked Scottish politics. He said: ""My dad bet, I think, Â£200 on mum winning and got odds of nine to one. That was a big sum in those days. We all got huge toys! ""Seriously though, my belief is that my mother's victory, and her huge workload in the following three years as MP for Hamilton, by touring Scotland and addressing well-attended public meetings was to set Scotland on a course of attaining self-government - a course from which we have never been deflected."" The SNP had been coming up in the polls for some time. In 1962, SNP chairman William Wolfe came second in a by-election in West Lothian with 23% of the vote. Under his leadership the party became more professional and expanded rapidly. But Hamilton gave the SNP credibility by showing that they could actually beat Labour in their heartland. Mr Reid said: ""It had an effect on me personally. ""In those days my ambition was to go to ITN and become a foreign correspondent. That is what I was going to do. ""For me and many others it was a call to arms. I very much doubt I would have stood in Clackmannan if she had not pointed the way."" In October 1974, Mr Reid was elected to Westminster himself as one of 11 SNP MPs. It took another quarter of a century, but he was there too when the Scottish Parliament opened in 1999. The SNP has had its highs and lows over the decades and Scotland is still on a journey. Fifty years ago, Hamilton is where it all began."
2017-11-02,It is hard to think of another Bank of England decision that is simultaneously as momentous and as inconsequential as this one.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171102203313/http://news.sky.com/story/who-are-the-winners-and-losers-if-the-bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-11108804,"The mere fact that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to raise interest rates this month is a landmark moment all of its own. It would be the first time rates have been lifted in a decade - a watershed after a period in which borrowing costs dropped to the lowest level on record. And for many economists, it is only the start of a long road that might take rates back up towards a more normal level (though this will almost certainly be lower than the pre-crisis ""normal"" of about 5%). But, on the basis of other measures, an interest rate rise is likely to have little impact. In part that is because, for all the headlines recently about levels of indebtedness, Britons' overall household debt levels have actually dropped a fair bit in recent years. A decade ago in the summer of 2007, the last time the Bank raised rates, the average UK household had Â£1.44 of debt for every pound of savings they had in the bank. Today, that ratio has dropped to Â£1.13 of debt for every pound of savings. Yes, that number has started to rise recently thanks to an increase in consumer credit lending, but only very slightly - and it is a long way shy of its pre-crisis peak. :: Interest rate rise looms next month after lift in economic growth Then there's the question of how many people will feel an instant impact of the Bank's decision - the ""transmission mechanism"", to use the economic terminology. Here, too, things have changed. Five years ago, 73% of the population had floating rate mortgages - in other words, loans where rates would instantly go up by 0.25% or near enough as soon as the Bank did likewise. Today, only 43% of mortgage holders have floating rate loans - the lowest proportion in history. That's the total stock of loans across the UK, many of which will be smaller loans. The reality for recent homebuyers (the ones with the bigger loans) is even more stark in the most recent quarter. A whopping 94% of mortgages were issued with fixed rates - the highest proportion in history. Long story short: fewer people than ever before will be affected on day one. None of this is to say that higher interest rates won't take their toll. It just underlines that the impact will be gradual and subtle, rather than immediate. But as anyone who has experienced debt problems before will know, that is precisely the way individual debt problems mount. :: Interest rate rise should not be feared, says Bank of England economist You face a short-term problem - say your rent going up, your job being lost or hours being cut, and you borrow a little bit to tide you over. Then things get worse, not better. Your debt costs rack up further and you find yourself mired in debt you can no longer see an escape from. It is a lonely, miserable experience, and something many families in the country struggle with. And that is the important point about rising interest rates. The Bank is not worried about a nationwide debt crisis, or an abrupt implosion of demand as it increases the cost of borrowing. However, it is concerned about small pockets of trouble across the country. In particular, low income households are likely to be most exposed - families who have had to borrow to absorb the cost of rising food and fuel prices, who have seen their real wages slide, and are now facing extra pressure from the benefits squeeze. It is they who will be most affected by rising rates. Again, this may not happen overnight: indeed, of all the interest rates out there in the market, those on credit cards and payday loans are perhaps least affected by Bank rate itself. But any increase in the cost of borrowing is unlikely to help. Finally, what about savers? Well, this is where things get interesting. On the one hand, savers have had a torrid time over the past few years - especially those expecting to live off the interest on their savings. On the other hand, the vast majority of other asset prices have gone up dramatically in that period: share prices, house prices (although mostly house prices in London), bond prices. Moreover, savers have benefited from an unusual phenomenon in recent years. Most of the time, the interest rates you're paid on your savings is below the official Bank rate. For instance, between 1999 and 2008, the average rate on an instant access savings account was 2.2 percentage points below the official Bank rate - and the rate on a long-term savings account was 0.6% below Bank rate. Since the crisis, the average instant access savings account has paid 0.24 percentage points above Bank rate while the average long-term account has paid 1.66 percentage points above the official rate. This is largely down to the fact that Britain's banks have spent this period trying to rebuild their balance sheets by attempting to lure in new customer deposits. In other words, while it hasn't been a great time to be a saver, it hasn't been quite as bad as the official Bank rate suggests. Which raises another question: if and when the official rate starts going up, do the savings rates themselves also increase, or do they stay where they are?"
2017-11-02,The Bank of England acts to curb inflation but what are the effects of an interest rate increase on day-to-day finances?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171102203313/http://news.sky.com/story/what-an-interest-rate-rise-means-for-you-11108751,":: Who are the winners and losers? First, this is not a big change. Interest rates are now back to their financial crisis level but the shift is likely to leave some worse off nonetheless, with borrowers set to feel the pinch most. Savers, who have had the most to complain about in the low interest rate environment, will see their interest rates return to the admittedly poor but higher levels that were last seen before August 2016, when the Bank cut rates in reaction to the Brexit vote. :: What will be the impact for my mortgage? Consumer groups say almost half of the UK's 9.1 million mortgage holders have never experienced the effects of a Bank of England rate rise, so this is important. If you are in the majority of 4.4 million with a fixed-rate mortgage (currently in high demand), you have nothing to worry about - yet. Your rate is guaranteed for the life of your current deal so there will be no extra cost. That said, lenders could now raise the cost of new fixed-rate mortgages to reflect the Bank of England's decision - making remortgaging more expensive. :: Interest rate: Latest updates According to industry body UK Finance, there are 3.7 million households on variable-rate or tracker mortgages - so named because they track any movement in the Bank of England's base rate of interest. Those borrowers will see their payments rise. How much depends on the terms of the deal, but a 0.25% increase in monthly repayments over a year would represent an average increase of up to Â£200, according to Moneywise. :: Why will savers benefit? Interest on most savings products since the financial crisis has been woeful, with investors turning to more risky alternatives such as the stock market and other investment products for meaningful rates of return. Here's why: average interest rates on easy access accounts have fallen below 0.5% this year so there will be some relief from a rate rise for a change. Banks and other providers are expected to pass the 0.25% interest rate on in full though individuals with fixed rate savings are likely to be disappointed. :: The effect on my credit card balance? This is less clear. The annual rate of growth in unsecured consumer credit is currently 9.9% with Â£200bn outstanding - a level last seen in 2008. The amount held on credit cards is included in this sum and the good news for borrowers is that card providers are currently under regulatory pressure to prevent a credit bubble and surge in defaults. It means that operators are less likely to pass on the rate rise by increasing APRs for fear of a backlash but never say never. :: Will this bring down prices at the shops? While the Bank of England has raised interest rates to tackle rising inflation, this move will not be reflected in everyday prices for some time to come. It took six months for the effects of the Brexit-hit pound to raise prices as imports became more expensive. Retailers fear rate rises as higher mortgage and other bills for consumers mean they will have less money to spend. :: Are there likely to be further increases in interest rates? This is the big question - but some think a series of rises next year is most unlikely. That is because the Bank is forecasting inflation to fall back below 3% and it will be mindful that rate rises risk choking weak growth in an economy already beset with Brexit-related jitters, despite strong employment levels."
2017-11-02,What is it about fixed-odds terminals that makes some people lose thousands of pounds in minutes?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171102203313/http://news.sky.com/story/fixed-odds-betting-addict-in-his-own-words-i-just-self-destruct-11106617,"As the Government says the maximum stake is to be reduced from Â£100 to between Â£2 and Â£50, a man struggling with his addiction to the machines shares his story. This is James Lowe's story, in his own words. :: I'm an addict I think about using the machines all the time. Every day. Several times a day. Twenty minutes ago. It's just there all the time. I'm always thinking, 'What if I can win that Â£2,000 jackpot in 4 minutes?' I don't think about what if I lose that Â£200 in a few minutes and can't eat for the next two weeks. :: Biggest loss The worst it's ever got was when I lost Â£5,000 in 65 minutes. I was just in, in, in. Cash, debit card everything. I couldn't stop. I was getting angry. After about Â£2,000 the guy behind the counter kept stopping the machine saying to calm down or he would kick me out. I said, 'That's what I want, I physically can't stop myself. You need to step in and stop me because I can't.' He didn't and by the end of it my knuckles were bleeding because I'd been banging the buttons so hard. :: First contact  I first came across the machines in around 2008. They used to have normal fruit machines in bookmakers and I remember that they started getting these screen machines in and I thought, 'These are nice, this is different, there's a lot of different games you can play'. The first few months I thought, 'This is good', but then it just spiralled out of control within a couple of months. I just started wasting more and more. :: Why they're so addictive? It's the quick wins. The amount of money that you can win so quickly, it's pretty crazy. I've walked into a bookies with Â£10 and literally within 15 minutes I've won nearly Â£2,500. It's that quick. But then on the flipside, you can lose Â£2,000 in an hour if not more if you're doing the maximum Â£100 bets.:: What it feels like to lose so much money When I lose, I hate it. I've been suicidal, I've got angry and violent and abusive. I don't care when I'm in that zone, I don't care what's going on around me or who's around me, it doesn't matter who's there if it's family, friends or whatever. I'll just deliberately self-destruct.:: How to stop the addiction Personally, I'd like to see these gambling machines banned from bookmakers altogether, but if that's not possible I'd like them to reduce the stake down from Â£100 to Â£5 or Â£2 and also bring the jackpot down as well. It's the only way. If the jackpot is still high, people will still do it. ::The Association of British Bookmakers said in a statement: ""Betting shops cater for over 6 million customers every year and the vast majority of them gamble responsibly. ""The average amount lost on a betting shop gaming machine in a session is just Â£9.17. ""We know that most problem gamblers use seven or more different types of gambling products, therefore there is a challenge for the whole gambling industry to move from a position where there is a stable level of problem gambling in this country to one where problem gambling rates are decreasing. ""Betting shops are investing very significant sums of money to help identify those at risk so that they get the help that they need. ""And an independent review of betting shops' self-exclusion scheme found that 83% of participants agree that it has been effective in reducing or stopping their gambling activity. We are continually updating and working to improve this scheme."""
2017-11-02,A notorious gangster who arranged taxis to ferry cash from his crime empire has been jailed for money laundering.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171102203313/http://news.sky.com/story/gangster-tommy-adams-jailed-for-seven-years-for-money-laundering-11109735,"Tommy Adams, the youngest of three brothers who headed the infamous Adams family, was caught after police bugged a cafe where he discussed his crimes with associates. The cash was driven or brought by train to London from Manchester, where other villains owed money to Adams - the brother of Terry and Patrick Adams, who have both been jailed for other matters. Undercover police watched couriers exchanging thousands of pounds in a Marks and Spencer plastic bag on the busy concourse of Euston station. Adams was said to have spent some of the cash on a new car for his daughter. He was jailed for seven years in August after a trial which can only be reported now after a second trial he faced was scrapped because of his ill health, and reporting restrictions were lifted. Adams, 59, suffered a heart attack outside a pub as he waited for the jury's verdict in the first trial. He was convicted after jurors heard how he had almost Â£250,000 cash brought from Manchester to London - money owed to him by fellow gangsters. Police secretly recorded Adams discussing the plot at a cafe opposite the headquarters of Independent Television News in central London. The Adams family - known to detectives as the A-Team - have been the target of several police operations over many years, suspected of involvement in various major crimes. Terry, the oldest of the brothers, was jailed in 2007 for seven years for tax evasion. He was ordered to pay back Â£700,000 under proceeds of crime laws. Earlier this year it was revealed that the 63-year-old was the godfather and adviser of playboy businessman James Stunt, recently divorced from Petra Ecclestone, daughter of Formula 1 racing boss Bernie Ecclestone. Patrick Adams, 61, was jailed for nine years last December for grievous bodily harm, shooting a former associate in a car after claiming he was attacked first and acted in self defence. His victim refused to give evidence. He had been on the run with his wife Constance in Amsterdam before he was captured and extradited. She was cleared of all charges. As she jailed Tommy Adams in August, Judge Alice Robinson told him and his co-defendants: ""The evidence demonstrated significant planning, contrivance and subterfuge."" Seven others were given jail sentences, including taxi firm boss Steven Mardon, 58, described as Adams' bookkeeper, and Antoniades Haralambos, 48, who the prosecutor said was his fixer. In total, they were given 33 years in prison, with one sentence suspended. In a separate case, Tommy Adams' son Shaun admitted using a forged pay slip to get a Â£231,000 mortgage to buy the lease on a pub. He was jailed for six months, suspended for a year. Another man, Lukas Menicou, admitted transferring criminal property, paying Â£150,000 into a bank account, as part of a building development. He got 10 months in prison, suspended for a year."

They will be tried in a military court. It is understood that one of the men who has been charged is still serving in the forces. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: ""Any decision to prosecute any personnel, veteran or serving, is made by the Service Prosecuting Authority, an independent body."" Lance Corporal Edward Maher and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts were pronounced dead on the Brecon Beacons after suffering heatstroke in July 2013. Corporal James Dunsby died at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital from multiple organ failure more than two weeks later. At the inquest into their deaths in 2015, coroner Louise Hunt said parts of the planning and conduct of the 16-mile SAS test march on 13 July, 2013, were inadequate or not fit for purpose. She said inadequate supplies of water also contributed to one of the deaths. All three men died as a result of a ""failure to properly organise and manage"" the march, she added. The two men could face up to two years in prison and dismissal if convicted."

Its usage has risen by more than 365% in the last twelve months, after it was enthusiastically adopted by Donald Trump in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. It succeeds last year's definitive word, ""Brexit"", which saw an unprecedented increase in use of over 3,400% during last year's fateful referendum. Other words on the 2017 shortlist included ""genderfluid"", ""fidget spinner"" and ""gig economy"" - the term for a system of casual, unstable employment that firms like Uber and Deliveroo have normalised. Significant terms from the last 12 months also include ""antifa"", an abbreviation of ant-fascist; ""echo-chamber"" to describe opinions being reinforced through social media; and ""Corbynmania"". ""Much of this year's list is definitely politically charged, but with a new president in the US and a snap election in the UK it is perhaps no surprise that politics continues to electrify the language,"" Helen Newstead, Collins' head of language content, said. ""'Fake news', either as a statement of fact or as an accusation, has been inescapable this year, contributing to the undermining of society's trust in news reporting."" Although Donald Trump has attempted to claim ownership of Fake News - describing it last month as ""one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with"" - it's been used to describe content from across the political spectrum. During the US election it was used to describe false news stories on propaganda-style blogs, which proved more popular on sites like Facebook than accurate coverage. According to a Buzzfeed analysis the most popular of those stories were pro-Trump - stories about Hillary Clinton selling weapons to ISIS, for example, or Pope Francis giving Mr Trump a presidential endorsement. It was only later that Donald Trump adopted ""Fake News"" as a slur against mainstream media outlets, such as CNN and the New York Times, which he claims harbour an unfair bias against him. In a press conference in January the President refused to answer a question from a CNN journalist with the retort ""you are fake news"". He has used the label to dismiss reports on issues ranging from Russian interference in the 2016 election to the effect of extreme weather in Puerto Rico. And because the term is now being used to discredit any fact or opinion the speaker doesn't agree with, many are worried that it could be having a damaging effect on democracy and our ability to know what is true. All the new words and definitions will now be added to the Collins dictionary. Will that help people tell the difference between real and fake news? That may have to be seen to be believed."

Carl Rogberg, John Scouler and Christopher Bush deny charges of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting. Mr Lewis told the court he had already become concerned about the financial structure of the group following a preliminary meeting with finance executives on 14 August 2014, following the announcement of his appointment to replace Philip Clarke as chief executive. He described how he volunteered to take up his post a month earlier than planned after receiving a call from then chairman Sir Richard Broadbent, who told him the company was poised to issue a profits warning. Under questioning from Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting the case for the Serious Fraud Office, Mr Lewis outlined the situation the company found itself in when he took over. He said he met the executive committee on 1 September 2014 at the company's headquarters in Hertfordshire. Mr Lewis said: ""I explained that clearly the business was in a difficult position. ""I asked them to alert me if there were any significant financial issues or indeed any reputational ones."" Mr Lewis explained that at another meeting on 4 September, Bush had raised concerns around the ability of making the UK side of the business more competitive, but that it was hard to afford to do that given the profits warning. He added: ""There was an awful lot of things in terms of the financial structure of the group that were deeply concerning. A lot of outstanding issues that needed attention."" The chief executive said he was told about the misstatement of profits on 19 September. When asked what his immediate reaction had been, Mr Lewis replied: ""One of surprise and one of shock really."" Tesco announced it in a statement to the stock market on 22 September - sparking a Â£2bn fall in its market value. The trial continues."

2017-11-02,The Bank of England has increased interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to 0.5% - the first rate rise since 2007.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171102203313/http://news.sky.com/story/bank-of-england-hikes-interest-rates-to-05-11109712,"Millions of mortgage borrowers face an increase in their monthly repayments after the decision by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) but savers should see a boost. The increase in the Bank rate was widely expected but marks a watershed moment after years of rock-bottom borrowing costs. Governor Mark Carney said that with unemployment at a 42-year low and inflation above its 2% target, it was time ""to ease our foot off the accelerator"" of stimulus which has been supporting the economy. Royal Bank of Scotland - which includes NatWest and Ulster Bank North - and TSB were among the first to confirm the hike was being passed on to some customers. The Bank of England also signalled that it may increase rates further in the coming years. :: What an interest rate rise means for you:: Why the Bank of England has raised interest rates But currency markets were unimpressed by the announcement, sending the pound more than one-and-a-half cents lower against the dollar to below $1.3050. That was after the pace of future increases implied by the Bank's forecasts was lower than some economists were expecting. They implied rates hitting 1% by 2020, with one increase of a quarter percentage point likely next year. Economists saw this as ""dovish"" in tone. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: ""We do not expect the MPC to act again until at least the fourth quarter of 2018."" The weaker pound boosted dollar earners on the FTSE 100, which closed just one point shy of its record high at 7555. Shares in UK-based banks RBS and Lloyds - which tend to benefit from higher interest rates - fell nearly 1% though. The MPC was split on Thursday's decision, with seven members including governor Mark Carney voting for the increase but two - Sir Jon Cunliffe and Sir Dave Ramsden - voting to keep rates on hold. Experts estimate eight million Britons have never seen an interest rate rise. The Bank of England cut interest rates to a historically low 0.5% in 2009 to try to help nurse the economy back to health at the height of the global financial crisis. They were then cut again last summer in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, to 0.25%. The decision to hike comes in the face of sluggish growth and warnings from some experts that it should be delayed to avoid further risking the economy. The change in Bank rate is likely to be reflected in instant increases in floating rate mortgages and by more gradual changes of other rates, including unsecured borrowing and savings rates. UK Finance, the trade body for Britain's lenders, says there were 9.2 million outstanding mortgage loans outstanding in June this year. Of these, 3.7 million were on a variable rate - including tracker mortgages directly linked to the Bank rate as well as those on standard variable rates set by individual banks and building societies. But the immediate impact of the rate hike will be less widespread than it would have been in prior years as a growing number - currently 4.4 million - were on fixed rate deals. The Bank of England said it expected inflation - already at a five-year high of 3% - to peak at 3.2% in the coming month and for economic growth to remain subdued in the coming years. Mr Carney signalled that Brexit was at the heart of weaknesses in the economy - driving up inflation through the fall in the pound since the referendum and holding back growth just as expansion elsewhere in the world is accelerating. He also argued that the impact of Brexit on the supply of workers, and investment, meant that the ""speed limit"" at which the economy can grow without pushing up inflation had fallen. The Bank slightly cut back its forecast for GDP growth for this year from 1.7% to 1.6%, and left the outlook for 2018 and 2019 unchanged at 1.6% and 1.7%."

""Like biological evidence, cyber evidence degrades over time - websites are taken down and the trail goes cold,"" said Detective Superintendent Neil Ballard from the cybercrime unit. To address this issue, the Met's cybercrime unit, Falcon, has started using technology first developed at the University of Cambridge and now developed by a company called Bromium. Speaking to Sky News, Bromium's co-founder and president, Ian Pratt, said: ""Our approach to cybersecurity is quite different from all the other companies that are out there. ""For every task that you're performing on a machine, for every document you open, every website you go to, we're actually going to create a virtual machine to run that particular task so that if anything bad happens, it's contained within that virtual machine."" As an academic, Mr Pratt led the systems research group at Cambridge for the best part of a decade and started the group's work on the Xen hypervisor, a technology which allows the hardware of a computer to support several operating systems at the same time. Xen, which Bromium is based on, is used to virtualise computing environments so that if the user accidentally lets any malicious processes execute they can't spread and infect other parts of their machine. Analysing malware can take months in a computer laboratory but, by using Bromium, the police specialists are able to let it execute in an isolated environment and follow how it behaves in real-time. The Office for National Statistics estimates more than 3.7 million instances of cybercrime occurred in the UK in 2016, and 46% of British companies admitted they had been attacked by hackers that year. A technical demonstration of Bromium shows how police can use its real-time forensics capabilities to identify key information about the criminal software infecting victims."
2017-11-02,"Doctors in Folkestone have warned patient safety is at risk because of a GP shortage that has seen one surgery close this week, with seven other practices telling officials they are too full to take any more patients.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171102203313/http://news.sky.com/story/doctors-warn-patients-are-in-danger-as-gp-shortage-forces-clinic-to-close-11108837,"The Folkestone East surgery closed on Tuesday with more than 25% of its 4,700 patients, many of them extremely vulnerable, yet to be allocated a place with an alternative doctor. Local GPs say the Kent town has 16 fewer GPs than it needs, and warn remaining surgeries are ""on their knees"". The situation has left doctors in revolt against the local health authority. Earlier this year, GPs at seven practices told the South Kent Coast Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) that they want to close their lists to new patients. The CCG, which has to give permission, refused, and instead effectively forced surgeries to accept new patients through a system of allocation, where places are determined centrally. The surgery says 1,900 patients have still not been found places, while the CCG says it is only 1,300. Doctors say the GP shortage is compromising the level of care they can provide and that the CCG refused to accept that many patients, including some with cancer, mental health conditions and substance dependencies, should be prioritised. The British Medical Association (BMA) told Sky News the position in Folkestone reflects an acute shortage of doctors in primary care across the country. The Folkestone East surgery closed following the retirement of two GPs and a third leaving the area. Despite trying to recruit replacements in the UK and abroad for more than a year, the practice did not have a single application. Dr Vanessa Goodall, a partner at the practice, said it left them with no choice but to close. ""We tried [to recruit] for over a year both in this country and abroad, and didn't get a single applicant. Not one,"" she said. ""Only a couple of years ago there would have been 20 plus replies to that advertisement and we would have to run a couple of days of interviews. There are just no GPs available now, everyone is working to their maximum capacity."" Dr Goodall said patients had been upset by the closure and care may suffer as patients lose their connection with their family doctor. She added: ""We've already seen the impact, the level of stress and distress we've seen in the last six months I never want to see again. Many of our patients are fearful, really fearful for the future. ""I personally feel that they are going to practices with experienced GPs, but those practices are already full and bulging at the seams. To continue to provide care to 500 or 1,000 new patients overnight, who they've never met, is a tall ask."" To be allocated a new doctor, patients had to fill in and return a nine-page form that is processed under contract by Capita at offices in Preston. They are then assigned a doctor and have to visit the surgery to register. South Kent Coast CCG said 1,300 people are yet to return the form and will receive reminders. Dr Goodall said the surgery asked the CCG to automatically allocate all 4,700 patients but it refused. Doctors and the CCG have also disagreed about the definition of vulnerable patients. The surgery said 2,320 patients should be prioritised, but the CCG calculated that only 1,143 qualified. The surgery said those left off their list included those with diabetes, cancer, HIV, heroin and cocaine addiction, and some who have made recent suicide attempts. Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the BMA's GPs committee, said: ""The pressures that GP practices in Folkestone are a reflection of a huge workload pressures that practices are experiencing right around the country. ""We're seeing reports of practices under pressure right around the country and that's because of a decade of underfunding, a difficulty recruiting new GPs and many practices feeling that the service that they are offering to patients is at risk of not being safe enough."" In a statement, South Kent Coast CCG said: ""The vast majority of Folkestone East patients have been successfully allocated to another local GP practice. We would encourage any remaining patients to complete and return their allocation form as soon as possible so that we can assign them to a new surgery."" A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""We understand the pressures GPs face as demand increases and our population ages - that's why we are investing an extra Â£2.4bn in GP surgeries over the next three years. ""But it is imperative that communities have access to their local surgeries, and we would urge GPs to consider the impact closing their lists would have on the wellbeing of their patients."""
2017-11-02,Donald Trump has called for the man suspected of being behind New York's worst terror attack since 9/11 to get the death penalty.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171102203313/http://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-says-new-york-terror-attack-suspect-sayfullo-saipov-should-be-executed-11109445,"Sayfullo Saipov has been charged with killing eight people in Manhattan after a rented truck was driven down a bike path close to the Hudson River and World Trade Center, targeting terrified pedestrians and cylists. Saipov has also been charged with providing material support to Islamic State. The suspect was shot in the chest by a police officer and then arrested, after crashing into a bus and getting out of his vehicle, brandishing air guns and knives and shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" - Arabic for ""God is greatest"". :: How the Manhattan terror attack unfolded The 29-year-old, who moved to the US in 2010 from Uzbekistan, has told investigators he was inspired by watching IS videos and began planning the atrocity more than a year ago. According to court documents and authorities, Saipov: :: Stated that he felt good about what he had done :: Made a trial run for the attack the week before :: Told officers he wanted to kill as many pedestrians as possible and carried out the attack on Halloween because there would be more people out on the streets :: Wanted to continue his killing spree across the Brooklyn Bridge :: Asked for an IS flag to be put in his hospital room Investigators disclosed that they found thousands of IS propaganda images and videos on a phone belonging to Saipov. These revelations prompted the President to write on Twitter: NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY! Mr Trump had earlier said he would be open to sending Saipov to Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba and vowed to dismantle the diversity immigrant visa programme, which he says allowed Saipov to come to the US. The government could choose to seek the death penalty against Saipov as the charge relating to the attack itself - violence and destruction of motor vehicles causing the deaths of eight people - would make him eligible for capital punishment if found guilty. Saipov's comments emerged because authorities said he waived his rights to remain silent and avoid self-incrimination and spoke to them without an attorney present from his bed at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. :: 'Hero cop risked his life' to shoot NY suspect He appeared in court on Wednesday shackled in a wheelchair, and was remanded in custody. As the investigation into the atrocity continues, the FBI said it had located another Uzbek man wanted for questioning as a person of interest, 32-year-old Mukhammadzoir Kadirov. US law enforcement officials said Saipov had been in contact with Kadirov and another person of interest in the investigation. Five of the eight people killed in the attack were part of a group from Argentina celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation. Two Americans and a Belgian woman who was in the city with her mother and sister also died. Twelve people were also injured in the city's deadliest attack since 2001, when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked planes into the Twin Towers and killed more than 2,600 people."

However, the Deterrence Force - an armed militia allied to the UN-backed government in Tripoli - has rejected the request. ""We will not extradite Hashem Abedi to UK authorities,"" spokesman Ahmad Ben Salim told the Reuters news agency. Later, a spokesperson for the Libyan government said it was ""cooperating to process"" the request. Greater Manchester Police said it was ""engaged with the Libyan authorities and are grateful for them considering the request"". The force added: ""It is not appropriate for us to comment further and we must respect the Libyan due process."" Legal expert Joshua Rozenberg told Sky News the standoff between British and Libyan authorities is ""a matter of negotiation"". He said: ""It's possible that the people holding him may want something for him, maybe money or support. ""I don't think Greater Manchester Police would have disclosed this unless they had some hope of getting him to stand trial in Manchester."" Hashem Abedi's older brother Salman killed 22 people in a suicide attack at Manchester Arena on 22 May. Both brothers had travelled to Libya in April, before Salman returned alone to carry out the atrocity. Hashem Abedi was arrested shortly afterwards, and has been accused by Libyan prosecutors of helping his brother and collecting materials for the attack. They also claimed that Hashem Abedi was receiving money transferred by his 22-year-old brother the time of his arrest. British counter terrorism police regard Hashem Abedi as a suspect and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham is among those calling for him to be tried in the UK. On Wednesday, police revealed that more than 500 people were injured in the terror attack. Officers said among those who survived the blast, 16 were seriously injured - with injuries including paralysis, loss of limbs, internal injuries and serious facial injuries. As part of the investigation so far, 23 people have been arrested, 30 addresses have been searched, 11,000 items have been seized and 16 terabytes of data has been examined.

The Old Vic theatre said it was ""deeply dismayed"" by the allegations against Spacey, adding ""no complaints"" had been made towards the actor during his time there or after he had left. Since the claims emerged, Netflix suspended the filming of the House of Cards series, and Spacey's 2017 Emmy Founders Award was revoked. Allegations against Spacey come in the wake of the scandal hitting Harvey Weinstein. Since then, several claims have been made against Hollywood actors and directors, including Jeremy Piven and Dustin Hoffman.

His body was collected from the mortuary at Royal Liverpool hospital by a Tameside Council official at around 9pm on 25 October, court documents show. The corpse was then taken with a police escort to Southport Crematorium, where the cremation took place at 10pm without music or flowers. Brady's ashes were placed in a weighted biodegradable urn, driven to Liverpool Marina and dispatched at sea on Thursday at 2.30am. In the 1960s, Brady tortured and murdered five children along with Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002. There had been fears his remains would be scattered on Saddleworth Moor - where the couple buried four of their victims. Brady and Hindley were convicted of luring children and teenagers to their deaths. Their victims were sexually tortured before being buried on the moor in the south Pennines. Pauline Reade, 16, disappeared on her way to a disco on 12 July 1963, and John Kilbride was snatched four months later. Keith Bennett was taken on 16 June 1964, after going to visit his grandmother; Lesley Ann Downey, 10, was lured from a Boxing Day funfair the same year; and Edward Evans, 17, was killed in October 1965. Brady was given whole life sentences for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward. He died at Ashworth High Security Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, where he had been locked up since 1985. Hindley was convicted of killing Lesley Ann and Edward and shielding Brady after John's murder. She was jailed for life. They both later confessed to the murders of Pauline - whose body was found in 1987 - and Keith. His body has never been discovered.

2017-11-03,It is hard to think of another Bank of England decision that is simultaneously as momentous and as inconsequential as this one.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171103212907/http://news.sky.com/story/who-are-the-winners-and-losers-if-the-bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-11108804,"The mere fact that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to raise interest rates this month is a landmark moment all of its own. It would be the first time rates have been lifted in a decade - a watershed after a period in which borrowing costs dropped to the lowest level on record. And for many economists, it is only the start of a long road that might take rates back up towards a more normal level (though this will almost certainly be lower than the pre-crisis ""normal"" of about 5%). But, on the basis of other measures, an interest rate rise is likely to have little impact. In part that is because, for all the headlines recently about levels of indebtedness, Britons' overall household debt levels have actually dropped a fair bit in recent years. A decade ago in the summer of 2007, the last time the Bank raised rates, the average UK household had Â£1.44 of debt for every pound of savings they had in the bank. Today, that ratio has dropped to Â£1.13 of debt for every pound of savings. Yes, that number has started to rise recently thanks to an increase in consumer credit lending, but only very slightly - and it is a long way shy of its pre-crisis peak. :: Interest rate rise looms next month after lift in economic growth Then there's the question of how many people will feel an instant impact of the Bank's decision - the ""transmission mechanism"", to use the economic terminology. Here, too, things have changed. Five years ago, 73% of the population had floating rate mortgages - in other words, loans where rates would instantly go up by 0.25% or near enough as soon as the Bank did likewise. Today, only 43% of mortgage holders have floating rate loans - the lowest proportion in history. That's the total stock of loans across the UK, many of which will be smaller loans. The reality for recent homebuyers (the ones with the bigger loans) is even more stark in the most recent quarter. A whopping 94% of mortgages were issued with fixed rates - the highest proportion in history. Long story short: fewer people than ever before will be affected on day one. None of this is to say that higher interest rates won't take their toll. It just underlines that the impact will be gradual and subtle, rather than immediate. But as anyone who has experienced debt problems before will know, that is precisely the way individual debt problems mount. :: Interest rate rise should not be feared, says Bank of England economist You face a short-term problem - say your rent going up, your job being lost or hours being cut, and you borrow a little bit to tide you over. Then things get worse, not better. Your debt costs rack up further and you find yourself mired in debt you can no longer see an escape from. It is a lonely, miserable experience, and something many families in the country struggle with. And that is the important point about rising interest rates. The Bank is not worried about a nationwide debt crisis, or an abrupt implosion of demand as it increases the cost of borrowing. However, it is concerned about small pockets of trouble across the country. In particular, low income households are likely to be most exposed - families who have had to borrow to absorb the cost of rising food and fuel prices, who have seen their real wages slide, and are now facing extra pressure from the benefits squeeze. It is they who will be most affected by rising rates. Again, this may not happen overnight: indeed, of all the interest rates out there in the market, those on credit cards and payday loans are perhaps least affected by Bank rate itself. But any increase in the cost of borrowing is unlikely to help. Finally, what about savers? Well, this is where things get interesting. On the one hand, savers have had a torrid time over the past few years - especially those expecting to live off the interest on their savings. On the other hand, the vast majority of other asset prices have gone up dramatically in that period: share prices, house prices (although mostly house prices in London), bond prices. Moreover, savers have benefited from an unusual phenomenon in recent years. Most of the time, the interest rates you're paid on your savings is below the official Bank rate. For instance, between 1999 and 2008, the average rate on an instant access savings account was 2.2 percentage points below the official Bank rate - and the rate on a long-term savings account was 0.6% below Bank rate. Since the crisis, the average instant access savings account has paid 0.24 percentage points above Bank rate while the average long-term account has paid 1.66 percentage points above the official rate. This is largely down to the fact that Britain's banks have spent this period trying to rebuild their balance sheets by attempting to lure in new customer deposits. In other words, while it hasn't been a great time to be a saver, it hasn't been quite as bad as the official Bank rate suggests. Which raises another question: if and when the official rate starts going up, do the savings rates themselves also increase, or do they stay where they are?"

He was given around Â£12,500 in money and possessions from charities and the local council - but actually lived miles away in southeast London. The 52-year-old - who has 28 previous convictions - was pictured next to Prince Charles when he visited a memorial wall near the tower in the weeks after the fire. Nguyen told the media - including Sky News - that he had escaped from the 15th floor with his 12-year-old son and wife. He said the blaze had destroyed ""everything"" he owned and appeared distressed as he described escaping from the tower, and the deaths of his loved ones. Nguyen said he had become separated from them and recounted seeing dead bodies in the hallways as he fought his way out of the building with a wet towel for protection. He claimed to have spent two nights in the Westway centre, set up for survivors, and that he was trying to get family over from Hong Kong for his wife and son's funeral. However, two days after Prince Charles' visit, Nguyen was arrested, and has now pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation. He has also admitted one count of making an untrue statement for the purpose of obtaining a passport. Nguyen, of Beckenham in southeast London, showed no emotion as he entered the pleas at Southwark Crown Court. His lies were discovered after he gave several different flat numbers - some of which did not exist and one where a real victim had lived. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay previously told the court that Nguyen had ""applied for Â£5,000 and gave his address as flat 18 Grenfell Tower, but there is no flat 17 or 18"". Vietnam-born Nguyen has been in the UK since the 1980s and has 28 other convictions for offences such as grievous bodily harm, arson and theft. He also has 17 aliases. Judge Philip Bartle called Nguyen's actions ""despicable"". He said: ""This defendant succeeded in achieving money out of the misery and tragedy of people who... genuinely suffered by this terrible fire."" Nguyen will be sentenced next month."

Hundreds gathered outside applauded as her coffin was carried into the church, and Archbishop Charles Scicluna warned the journalist's murderers: ""However hard you try to evade from the justice of men, you will never escape from the justice of God."" Mourners included Ms Caruana Galizia's husband, her three adult sons and European Parliament President Antonio Tajani. Malta's top politicians stayed away at the request of her family, who have criticised the government for not dealing with the corruption she covered in her blog, Running Commentary. Ms Caruana Galizia also wrote twice a week for the Malta Independent and at the time of her death was being sued in 42 libel cases. Witnesses described seeing two explosions coming from her car and the vehicle skidding down the road at high speed, before ending up in fire in a field. Her son, Matthew Caruana Galizia, said he found his mother's body in pieces. The assassination sparked outrage in Malta, and among many journalists and politicians in Europe and worldwide, who view it as an attack on free speech. Archbishop Scicluna used his funeral address to make a direct appeal for Ms Caruana Galizia's contemporaries to continue her work. ""Dear journalists, we need you,"" he said. ""We need people in your profession who are unshackled, who are free, intelligent, inquisitive, honest, serene, safe and protected."" People outside the church sang the national anthem and clapped as the coffin was carried out by Ms Caruana Galizia's sons. The journalist's articles probed issues such as government officials named in the Panama Papers leaks, Malta's reputation as a tax haven, and links with Libya. Europol, the EU law enforcement agency, has confirmed it has sent three experts to the Mediterranean island to help investigate. ""They are working directly with the investigation team established by Malta police and their task is to support the investigation wherever it may lead,"" said Europol spokesman Jan Op Gen Oorth. Police are looking at similarities with five other unsolved car bombings in Malta over the last two years. Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, often a target of Caruana Galizia's articles, has vowed no stone will be left unturned, and has offered a â¬1m (Â£890,000) reward to bring her killers to justice. However, the journalist's family issued a stinging response last week on Facebook. It said: ""A government and a police force that failed our mother in life will also fail her in death. The people who for as long as we can remember sought to silence our mother cannot now be the ones to deliver justice."""

2017-11-03,The Bank of England has increased interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to 0.5% - the first rate rise since 2007.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171103212907/http://news.sky.com/story/bank-of-england-hikes-interest-rates-to-05-11109712,"Millions of mortgage borrowers face an increase in their monthly repayments after the decision by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) but savers should see a boost. The increase in the Bank rate was widely expected but marks a watershed moment after years of rock-bottom borrowing costs. Governor Mark Carney said that with unemployment at a 42-year low and inflation above its 2% target, it was time ""to ease our foot off the accelerator"" of stimulus which has been supporting the economy. Royal Bank of Scotland - which includes NatWest and Ulster Bank North - and TSB were among the first to confirm the hike was being passed on to some customers. The Bank of England also signalled that it may increase rates further in the coming years. :: What an interest rate rise means for you:: Why the Bank of England has raised interest rates But currency markets were unimpressed by the announcement, sending the pound more than one-and-a-half cents lower against the dollar to below $1.3050. That was after the pace of future increases implied by the Bank's forecasts was lower than some economists were expecting. They implied rates hitting 1% by 2020, with one increase of a quarter percentage point likely next year. Economists saw this as ""dovish"" in tone. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: ""We do not expect the MPC to act again until at least the fourth quarter of 2018."" The weaker pound boosted dollar earners on the FTSE 100, which closed just one point shy of its record high at 7555. Shares in UK-based banks RBS and Lloyds - which tend to benefit from higher interest rates - fell nearly 1% though. The MPC was split on Thursday's decision, with seven members including governor Mark Carney voting for the increase but two - Sir Jon Cunliffe and Sir Dave Ramsden - voting to keep rates on hold. Experts estimate eight million Britons have never seen an interest rate rise. The Bank of England cut interest rates to a historically low 0.5% in 2009 to try to help nurse the economy back to health at the height of the global financial crisis. They were then cut again last summer in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, to 0.25%. The decision to hike comes in the face of sluggish growth and warnings from some experts that it should be delayed to avoid further risking the economy. The change in Bank rate is likely to be reflected in instant increases in floating rate mortgages and by more gradual changes of other rates, including unsecured borrowing and savings rates. UK Finance, the trade body for Britain's lenders, says there were 9.2 million outstanding mortgage loans outstanding in June this year. Of these, 3.7 million were on a variable rate - including tracker mortgages directly linked to the Bank rate as well as those on standard variable rates set by individual banks and building societies. But the immediate impact of the rate hike will be less widespread than it would have been in prior years as a growing number - currently 4.4 million - were on fixed rate deals. The Bank of England said it expected inflation - already at a five-year high of 3% - to peak at 3.2% in the coming month and for economic growth to remain subdued in the coming years. Mr Carney signalled that Brexit was at the heart of weaknesses in the economy - driving up inflation through the fall in the pound since the referendum and holding back growth just as expansion elsewhere in the world is accelerating. He also argued that the impact of Brexit on the supply of workers, and investment, meant that the ""speed limit"" at which the economy can grow without pushing up inflation had fallen. The Bank slightly cut back its forecast for GDP growth for this year from 1.7% to 1.6%, and left the outlook for 2018 and 2019 unchanged at 1.6% and 1.7%."

2017-11-03,"The number of patients who wait more than an hour to be transferred from an ambulance to Accident & Emergency in England has more than doubled in the last two years, new figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171103212907/http://news.sky.com/story/ambulance-delays-at-accident-emergency-more-than-double-11110825,"According to NHS England, patients should be transferred from an ambulance to A&E within 15 minutes. Earlier this year the Public Accounts Committee reported that the target was being routinely breached, and had been met in just 53% of cases in 2015-16. Now figures released under the Freedom of Information Act to Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, show the number of people facing lengthy waits in ambulance bays has increased sharply. The figures for 10 of 11 ambulance trusts in England show the number of patients waiting more than one hour has more than doubled in two years, up from 51,115 in 2014-15 to 111,524 in 2016-17. More than half a million people waited more than 30 minutes to be transferred, up from 289,264 to 509,062 in the same period. The steepest increases were recorded at the London Ambulance Trust and the South East Coast Ambulance Service, both of which saw rises of more than 300% in delays of more than one hour. Delays in transferring patients at hospital have a knock-on effect on the rest of the emergency system, and can contribute to delays in despatching ambulances to new cases. Mr Ashworth said the figures were indicative of the strain on the health service and called on the Government to increase NHS funding in the Budget later this month. ""I think this research is incredibly shocking and reveals that our hospitals in many situations are overcrowded and overwhelmed, and it's because the Government I'm afraid are not putting in the funding that our NHS needs. ""We are saying to the Government, to Jeremy Hunt, to Philip Hammond you've got a Budget coming up, you can do something about this. Put the extra investment into our NHS so that patients get the level of care that they deserve."" There can be many reasons for delayed transfers, but they are indicative of pressure on emergency departments. Earlier this year NHS Improvement (NHSI) issued what it called ""tactical advice"" to hospitals and ambulance services about how to improve ""handover"". They warned that ambulance queuing can increase the risk to patients because of delays in treatment, increase risk in the community when no ambulance can respond, and waste resources. NHSI said in 2016-17 over 41,000 12-hour ambulance shifts were lost due to queueing, and said their aim was ""effective patient handover from the ambulance team within 15 minutesâ¦ [and] ambulances being back on the road, ready to respond to further calls, 15 minutes later"". The Department of Health said NHS England and NHSI are working to reduce handover delays, and that they have recruited 2,600 more paramedics since 2010. A spokesperson said: ""In the face of huge increases in demand, our paramedics and call-handlers are working exceptionally hard and answering 4,500 more 999 calls every day compared to five years ago. ""Nevertheless, we expect patient handovers from ambulance to A&E to happen within 30 minutes and where delays occur hospital and ambulance trusts have a responsibility to make improvements."""

In a statement on Friday, officers said the vegetable, which measured 40cm in length, ""really did look very much like a bomb"". The dark-coloured courgette weighed about 5kg and police believe it may have been thrown over into the man's garden over a hedge. Unexploded wartime bombs are often found at German building sites and can cause a lot of disruption, with authorities often forced to evacuate buildings and nearby areas while they are defused. In September, about 60,000 people had to leave their homes in Frankfurt as explosives experts defused a huge wartime bomb. Residents were ordered to leave after the unexploded 1.8-ton British device was found during construction work in a wealthy suburb of the city. It was Germany's biggest evacuation since the Second World War."

Among them was a report that when she complained of having cold hands at a meeting, the now former Defence Secretary replied: ""I know where you can put them to warm them up."" Sir Michael categorically denies the report, carried in The Sun. A source close to him told the paper: ""He categorically denies saying something as appalling as he knows where she could warm her hands."" Ms Leadsom was said to have delivered the allegations to Downing Street after it failed to investigate Sir Michael, amid a sexual harassment scandal brewing in Westminster. The Sevenoaks MP said he was quitting because ""allegations"" had been surfacing ""about my previous conduct"", admitting he had ""fallen below"" the high standards expected of him. His only public admission was to touching a journalist's knee at a conference 15 years ago. Ms Leadsom has not denied the claims caused her then-Cabinet colleague to resign.

The cash was driven or brought by train to London from Manchester, where other villains owed money to Adams - the brother of Terry and Patrick Adams, who have both been jailed for other matters. Undercover police watched couriers exchanging thousands of pounds in a Marks and Spencer plastic bag on the busy concourse of Euston station. Adams was said to have spent some of the cash on a new car for his daughter. He was jailed for seven years in August after a trial which can only be reported now after a second trial he faced was scrapped because of his ill health, and reporting restrictions were lifted. Adams, 59, suffered a heart attack outside a pub as he waited for the jury's verdict in the first trial. He was convicted after jurors heard how he had almost Â£250,000 cash brought from Manchester to London - money owed to him by fellow gangsters. Police secretly recorded Adams discussing the plot at a cafe opposite the headquarters of Independent Television News in central London. The Adams family - known to detectives as the A-Team - have been the target of several police operations over many years, suspected of involvement in various major crimes. Terry, the oldest of the brothers, was jailed in 2007 for seven years for tax evasion. He was ordered to pay back Â£700,000 under proceeds of crime laws. Earlier this year it was revealed that the 63-year-old was the godfather and adviser of playboy businessman James Stunt, recently divorced from Petra Ecclestone, daughter of Formula 1 racing boss Bernie Ecclestone. Patrick Adams, 61, was jailed for nine years last December for grievous bodily harm, shooting a former associate in a car after claiming he was attacked first and acted in self defence. His victim refused to give evidence. He had been on the run with his wife Constance in Amsterdam before he was captured and extradited. She was cleared of all charges. As she jailed Tommy Adams in August, Judge Alice Robinson told him and his co-defendants: ""The evidence demonstrated significant planning, contrivance and subterfuge."" Seven others were given jail sentences, including taxi firm boss Steven Mardon, 58, described as Adams' bookkeeper, and Antoniades Haralambos, 48, who the prosecutor said was his fixer. In total, they were given 33 years in prison, with one sentence suspended. In a separate case, Tommy Adams' son Shaun admitted using a forged pay slip to get a Â£231,000 mortgage to buy the lease on a pub. He was jailed for six months, suspended for a year. Another man, Lukas Menicou, admitted transferring criminal property, paying Â£150,000 into a bank account, as part of a building development. He got 10 months in prison, suspended for a year."

The Cabinet Office will now lead the inquiry into the events of the 1970s and 1980s when thousands of haemophiliacs and other patients were given blood products infected with hepatitis C and HIV. Prime Minister Theresa May ordered the inquiry earlier this year, saying she wanted ""justice"" for the victims and their families. Downing Street said it had considered the ""strong view"" that the Department of Health should not be responsible for the probe when it is under investigation itself. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""The inquiry will be conducted under the responsibility of the Cabinet Office rather than by the Department of Health with immediate effect. ""We have been absolutely clear of our determination to establish what happened in relation to the contaminated blood scandal of the 1970s and 1980s and to work with the families of those affected, and we are now moving forward with that process."" Campaigners and families of those affected by the scandal boycotted a meeting with Department of Health officials earlier this year in protest at its involvement in the inquiry. Cabinet documents obtained by Sky News revealed senior ministers in the 1987 Conservative Government pursued a deliberate policy of not accepting any responsibility for the scandal and tried to limit its financial liability to victims - despite privately acknowledging it could not ""refute convincingly"" the allegation that it was at fault. Downing Street said there had been around 800 responses to a consultation which asked families and victims if they wanted a judge-led inquiry into the scandal or a Hillsborough-style panel. A further announcement about the probe is expected before the end of the year."

He has called for stronger border controls and recently demanded that the Treasury includes a billion pounds in the next Budget to prepare for leaving before an agreement is reached. According to his website, his political hero is Abraham Lincoln. This latest allegation comes as Westminster is rocked by an explosive sex scandal that some think will be ""bigger than expenses"". The scandal claimed its first Cabinet member last week, when Michael Fallon quit as Defence Secretary, saying that his behaviour had ""fallen below"" the high standards expected of him. He had previously apologised after repeatedly touching journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer's knee at a party conference dinner. Conservative MPs Damian Green and Mark Garnier are both facing investigations over allegations of inappropriate behaviour. Labour has suspended veteran MP Kelvin Hopkins, pending an investigation into claims of inappropriate touching and sending suggestive text messages. He ""absolutely and categorically"" denies the claims. There have also been claims that Labour MP Clive Lewis touched a Labour activist inappropriately during the Labour 2017 conference. He also strongly denies the allegations. Following the wave of allegations, Theresa May has launched new mandatory Conservative code of conduct. Labour has said it will appoint an independent specialist organisation offering confidential advice and support to anyone affected by sexual harassment in the party."

The former child star said Salva had been grooming him since he was six after he befriended Winters' mother who made film props. He said: ""His grooming process was developing my love and trust. Developing my parents' trust. ""Essentially he became a close friend of the family and it turned from 'How about I take Nathan for a few hours tonight, give you guys a break' into full weekends at his house."" Winters said Salva invited him to stay at his apartment, where they watched Disney's The Jungle Book together. ""He started talking about Mowgli's loin cloth so that he could make me one,"" he said. ""He got two bandanas and tied them together and made this loin cloth and as he's tying them, he's fondling me. And that's my first memory of when the abuse started. ""It progressed over the next five years... For him, everything was sexual. He videotaped all of it, it was full-blown."" When Winters' family found out, they went to the police. Salva was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison, but served less than half. Winters says the process of going through the courts was traumatic and intimidating. ""He had a nice expensive lawyer... There were people watching us. I think there's no other intent than to make us aware that we were being watched, to intimidate us and scare us off,"" he said. As a convicted paedophile, Salva is on the sex offenders register but it hasn't stopped him working in Hollywood. Powder, one of the scripts he wrote in prison, was distributed by Disney's Buena Vista Pictures. He has also directed the Jeepers Creepers franchise. Winters, however, was told he would never work in the industry again. ""I was basically black balled for telling the truth. He's been coddled completely, big names in Hollywood have been backing him throughout the entire process. Seems like there's an exclusive club and Victor's part of that club."" When the Weinstein scandal broke, we predicted more allegations about other powerful Hollywood players would surface. Some have been more surprising and shocking than others, but we were horrified at how little we had to scratch the surface to uncover stories of paedophilia in Hollywood. For decades, former teen idol Corey Feldman has been met with varying levels of scepticism in speaking out about the abuse he suffered by Hollywood paedophiles - along with his friend Corey Haim who, before he died, said he was raped aged 11. Starring together in 1987's The Lost Boys, they were two of the biggest child stars in the Eighties. But it seems finding the courage to go public about their abuse hasn't been enough to encourage others to dare to come forward. ""Right off the bat I can name six names, one of them who is still very powerful today, and a story that links all the way up to a studio, it connects paedophilia to one of the major studios,"" Feldman said in a video he posted on Twitter in October. US sexual abuse lawyer Jeff Herman told us the problem is staggering. ""I've heard many stories of kids going to an agent who can control their career, the agents spending time alone with the child, they're able to get them away without parental supervision, and then they take advantage of these kids. It's more common than we can even imagine,"" he said. ""I've heard stories from adults who were abused as kids in Hollywood who've talked to me about going to these industry events where there are multiple men there exchanging information about kids, it's frightening,"" he added. Child abuse experts in Los Angeles say they treat 200-300 cases of sexual abuse every year. As part of a two-month operation targeting child predators in Southern California, LA Police made 238 arrests in 2016. Commanding Officer at the LA Police Department Juvenile Division Paul Espinosa told us it's much harder to detect abuse among minors. ""It takes that inner strength to come forward. Now, with children that inner strength is not the same as with adults,"" he said. It's a concern echoed by lawyer Jeff Herman: ""They feel like they've done something wrong, they feel guilty, and it's very difficult to come and talk about it because you're not even sure if you're a victim."" Star of 1970s US sitcom Diff'rent Strokes Todd Bridges, who was molested by his publicist, told us that abuse has destroyed countless lives in Hollywood. ""I'm one of the few children who's still around. Pretty much every one of my protÃ©gÃ©s have died or committed suicide or OD'd, you know, because they couldn't get over the stuff that happened to them,"" he said. ""At the time that it was going on, 11 to 12, I didn't know what I was. As a little kid you don't know what you are, I'd never had sexual encounters or anything and when that man did it to me, he'd groomed me very well."" Hollywood writer Tony Hawkins points out that while children are particularly vulnerable, the power imbalance is heightened further by the fact many film industry people have a huge amount of influence. ""These people throw money at the problem, whether it's paying people off or hiring a team of lawyers, powerful people use money as a shield and this is why all these people stay silent, it's a very hard and powerful thing to fight."" One of the most disturbing aspects of the Weinstein scandal is the people around him who were complicit in protecting the producer, keeping quiet about accusations of sexual assault and rape - which Weinstein denies. The domino effect of people coming forward with allegations of misconduct by other powerful figures has been astonishing as people feel empowered to share their horrifying allegations. Tyler Grasham, an agent for one of the stars of Stranger Things, was fired after being accused of raping an 18-year-old. With allegations mounting, Kevin Spacey has apologised to actor Anthony Rapp for sexual harassment when he was 14. And the Weinstein controversy has prompted fresh attacks over why Roman Polanski continues to be decorated with industry awards - despite a conviction for raping a 13-year-old. The power that comes with fame seems to make some untouchable - a fact that comes as no surprise to Hollywood writer Tony Horkins. ""If we look at historically at what's been going on, how long ago was it that Mel Gibson was completely derided in this town and he's now being lauded for his work. We've seen these scandals for Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, scandals become very public and then a few years later they're being given more money for projects."" This selective amnesia is further evidenced in the case of Brian Peck. In 2004 the actor was convicted of sex with a child. But just two years later he got a role on the kids' show The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody, and has since been working as a dialogue coach on Anger Management. When we queried whether Peck's inclusion on the sex offenders register was considered when hiring him on Anger Management, someone close to the show, who wishes to remain anonymous, told us the decision to hire him was taken by the show's star Charlie Sheen. A cast member had complained when they found out about Peck's background and an investigation had been conducted, but as Peck had served his time, the recommendation was that he could be allowed to stay on set providing no children were present and if his time off set was limited to Sheen's trailer. Lawyer Jeff Herman warns what Hollywood is seeing now is just the beginning. ""You just have to look at what's happening with young women, we know they're not being protected so what makes us think that anyone else is being protected? This is opening up, I think, a big can of worms for Hollywood."" Winters hopes people will now find strength in one another to speak out. ""Whether you're a woman, man, child or adult abuse is abuse and victims and survivors should all band together. ""There's strength in numbers and I'm really hoping that through this exposure more people will come forward."" In covering this story, there was one thing Bridges said that has stayed with us this week: ""When you realise it's wrong, they say you're lying."" You can't quite imagine the enormity of what it must be like to go through something as harrowing as he did as a child - to be too scared to tell anyone, and when you finally find the courage to speak up, you are ignored, dismissed, discredited or paid off. So it begs the question whether this will be enough of a catalyst to finally force Hollywood to oust its abusers."

Officers seized 24 million tablets in the port of Gioia Tauro in southern Italy. The shipment was on its way to Libya from India when it was intercepted by authorities. The tablets contained the drug tramadol, a strong painkiller used by doctors to treat moderate to severe pain. It has been nicknamed ""the drug of fighters"" because of its use by jihadist fighters in the Middle East. Militants are thought to use the painkiller to dull pain and suppress fatigue. Italian investigators said the group would sell the drug to soldiers for a price of around two euros a tablet. ""The traffic of tramadol is directly handled by IS to finance terrorist activities planned and carried out across the world,"" said an Italian court in the city of Reggio Calabria. Some of the money raised from the sales would also go ""to subsidise terrorist groups and extremists operating in Libya, Syria and Iraq,"" it said in a statement. The interception came six months after a similar shipment of 37 million tablets was seized by authorities in Genoa in May. The court said the operation was possible thanks in part to input from the US Drug Enforcement Administration."

However, the Deterrence Force - an armed militia allied to the UN-backed government in Tripoli - has rejected the request. ""We will not extradite Hashem Abedi to UK authorities,"" spokesman Ahmad Ben Salim told the Reuters news agency. Later, a spokesperson for the Libyan government said it was ""cooperating to process"" the request. Greater Manchester Police said it was ""engaged with the Libyan authorities and are grateful for them considering the request"". The force added: ""It is not appropriate for us to comment further and we must respect the Libyan due process."" Legal expert Joshua Rozenberg told Sky News the standoff between British and Libyan authorities is ""a matter of negotiation"". He said: ""It's possible that the people holding him may want something for him, maybe money or support. ""I don't think Greater Manchester Police would have disclosed this unless they had some hope of getting him to stand trial in Manchester."" Hashem Abedi's older brother Salman killed 22 people in a suicide attack at Manchester Arena on 22 May. Both brothers had travelled to Libya in April, before Salman returned alone to carry out the atrocity. Hashem Abedi was arrested shortly afterwards, and has been accused by Libyan prosecutors of helping his brother and collecting materials for the attack. They also claimed that Hashem Abedi was receiving money transferred by his 22-year-old brother the time of his arrest. British counter terrorism police regard Hashem Abedi as a suspect and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham is among those calling for him to be tried in the UK. On Wednesday, police revealed that more than 500 people were injured in the terror attack. Officers said among those who survived the blast, 16 were seriously injured - with injuries including paralysis, loss of limbs, internal injuries and serious facial injuries. As part of the investigation so far, 23 people have been arrested, 30 addresses have been searched, 11,000 items have been seized and 16 terabytes of data has been examined. Greater Manchester Police said it took 1,300 statements, with more than 5,000 people referenced in the inquiry. Officers are still working through 16,000 hours of CCTV and more than eight million lines of telephone communications data."
2017-11-03,"A bigger and brighter moon will shine over Earth this weekend, in the second supermoon of the year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171103212907/http://news.sky.com/story/hunters-moon-when-and-where-to-see-supermoon-this-weekend-11111724,"Hunter's Moon - also known as a Beaver moon, a Frosty moon and a Snow moon - will light up the night sky as it travels closer to Earth, appearing about 30% brighter and 14% bigger as it comes more than 12,700 miles nearer than usual. The Hunter's Moon will be visible on Friday and Saturday night, and at peak full phase at 5.23am on Saturday. A supermoon is the name given to the phenomenon when the moon is both full and closer to the Earth than normal. Due to the fact it does not orbit the sun in a perfect circle, instead moving in a slight oval, it can move closer or further to Earth depending on the point of its course. Tom Kerss, astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich, said he expected it to be ""a really beautiful sight"", adding that the best time to see it would be around midnight on Saturday when the moon is at its highest. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ''On Saturday there will be cloudy skies and outbreaks of rain across the majority of England and Wales, but by Saturday night the rain should clear off into the North Sea, allowing for clear skies to develop across many central and eastern parts of the UK. ""Those areas will have the best chance of seeing the supermoon, and it'll also be good for those going to watch firework displays. ""Western parts of the UK and Ireland will have cloudier skies and showers through Saturday night, so unfortunately a good view of the moon is less likely across the west''. The next supermoon will rise on 3 December, with the Hunter's Moon of 2016 - which was the largest in 70 years - not set to be surpassed in size until 2034. Facts about the moon :: The moon orbits Earth every 27.5 days and the same side always faces us. :: It is moving away from us at 3.8cm a year - which means that in 50 million years, it will take 47 days to orbit Earth. :: The moon is 2,159 miles in diameter - the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system. :: Just 24 people - all US astronauts - have seen the far side of the moon with their own eyes. :: Only 12 people have walked on it (but not for 44 years). :: You would weigh just 16.5% of your Earth weight on the moon because it has a much smaller mass and a weaker gravitational pull. :: NASA plans to return to the moon with a human mission around 2019."
2017-11-03,What is it about fixed-odds terminals that makes some people lose thousands of pounds in minutes?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171103212907/http://news.sky.com/story/fixed-odds-betting-addict-in-his-own-words-i-just-self-destruct-11106617,"As the Government says the maximum stake is to be reduced from Â£100 to between Â£2 and Â£50, a man struggling with his addiction to the machines shares his story. This is James Lowe's story, in his own words. :: I'm an addict I think about using the machines all the time. Every day. Several times a day. Twenty minutes ago. It's just there all the time. I'm always thinking, 'What if I can win that Â£2,000 jackpot in 4 minutes?' I don't think about what if I lose that Â£200 in a few minutes and can't eat for the next two weeks. :: Biggest loss The worst it's ever got was when I lost Â£5,000 in 65 minutes. I was just in, in, in. Cash, debit card everything. I couldn't stop. I was getting angry. After about Â£2,000 the guy behind the counter kept stopping the machine saying to calm down or he would kick me out. I said, 'That's what I want, I physically can't stop myself. You need to step in and stop me because I can't.' He didn't and by the end of it my knuckles were bleeding because I'd been banging the buttons so hard. :: First contact  I first came across the machines in around 2008. They used to have normal fruit machines in bookmakers and I remember that they started getting these screen machines in and I thought, 'These are nice, this is different, there's a lot of different games you can play'. The first few months I thought, 'This is good', but then it just spiralled out of control within a couple of months. I just started wasting more and more. :: Why they're so addictive? It's the quick wins. The amount of money that you can win so quickly, it's pretty crazy. I've walked into a bookies with Â£10 and literally within 15 minutes I've won nearly Â£2,500. It's that quick. But then on the flipside, you can lose Â£2,000 in an hour if not more if you're doing the maximum Â£100 bets.:: What it feels like to lose so much money When I lose, I hate it. I've been suicidal, I've got angry and violent and abusive. I don't care when I'm in that zone, I don't care what's going on around me or who's around me, it doesn't matter who's there if it's family, friends or whatever. I'll just deliberately self-destruct.:: How to stop the addiction Personally, I'd like to see these gambling machines banned from bookmakers altogether, but if that's not possible I'd like them to reduce the stake down from Â£100 to Â£5 or Â£2 and also bring the jackpot down as well. It's the only way. If the jackpot is still high, people will still do it. ::The Association of British Bookmakers said in a statement: ""Betting shops cater for over 6 million customers every year and the vast majority of them gamble responsibly. ""The average amount lost on a betting shop gaming machine in a session is just Â£9.17. ""We know that most problem gamblers use seven or more different types of gambling products, therefore there is a challenge for the whole gambling industry to move from a position where there is a stable level of problem gambling in this country to one where problem gambling rates are decreasing. ""Betting shops are investing very significant sums of money to help identify those at risk so that they get the help that they need. ""And an independent review of betting shops' self-exclusion scheme found that 83% of participants agree that it has been effective in reducing or stopping their gambling activity. We are continually updating and working to improve this scheme."""
2017-11-03,"A US soldier who deserted his post in Afghanistan has been spared jail - a decision Donald Trump has described as ""a disgrace"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171103212907/http://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-sentence-handed-to-deserting-us-soldier-bowe-bergdahl-a-disgrace-11111795,"Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was captured and held hostage by the Taliban for five years after walking off his post in 2009. The 31-year-old pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy, but on Friday a military judge ruled that he should serve no prison time. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a ""rotten traitor"" and said he ""should have been executed"". Reacting to the serviceman's sentence, the President tweeted: ""The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our country and to our military."" Bergdahl claimed he abandoned his position at Observation Post Mest Malak, Paktika Province, to spark a panic and draw attention to problems with his unit. But his plan to walk to another US base failed within hours as he was located and abducted by Taliban fighters. Bergdahl said he was tortured in captivity and spent years either locked in a cage or chained on all fours. A Navy Seal and an Army National Guard were seriously wounded in attempts to rescue him from his captors - sparking debate in the US over whether efforts to secure his release should be stopped. He was eventually freed in 2014 when former president Barack Obama approved a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. During his military trial, Bergdahl apologised to soldiers injured during rescue efforts. He said: ""I would like everyone who searched for me to know it was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen. ""My words alone can't take away their pain."" A psychiatrist told the hearing that Bergdahl's decision to leave his post was influenced by post-traumatic stress disorder and a schizophrenia-like condition called schizotypal personality disorder. Dr Charles Morgan said the latter condition made it difficult for Bergdahl to understand the consequences of his actions. The serviceman was given a dishonourable discharge, had his rank reduced to private and was ordered to forfeit $10,000 (Â£7,650) in pay over 10 months. Prosecutors had pushed for Bergdahl to be jailed for 14 years. Following the hearing, defence lawyer Eugene Fidell criticised Mr Trump for making ""really extraordinary reprehensible comments targeted directly at our client"". He added that the President helped to create ""one of the most preposterous states of affairs"" in American legal history. Meanwhile, a soldier who was wounded searching for Bergdahl has described the sentence as ""completely unacceptable"". Jonathan Morita, from California, underwent three operations and lost the use of two fingers on his right hand after he was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, which didn't explode. ""I've had better days,"" Mr Morita said. ""He'll pay the fine like people get fined for illegal fishing. ""It should have maybe not been the life sentence, but it should have been something."""
2017-11-03,"The FTSE 100 has closed at a record high of 7,560, a day after the Bank of England raised the interest rate.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171103212907/http://news.sky.com/story/ftse-100-closes-at-record-high-11111761,"Friday's close beat the previous record closing high of 7,556, which the index reached on 12 October. The blue chip index ended the day up by just 0.07% but was enough to break the record high for the second time in a month. Analysts say it was driven partly by the weak pound with listed firms tending to benefit when foreign currencies are stronger. ""The Footsie has climbed this week on the back of a falling pound, as currency markets groaned at the Bank of England's weak expectations for future interest rate rises,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. It follows Thursday's decision by the Bank of England to raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade. The Monetary Policy Committee increased the base rate to 0.5% from 0.25%, where it had been set since the EU referendum. The central bank warned uncertainty presented by the UK's break from Brussels was still weighing on domestic activity and that future hikes would be more ""gradual"". ""Of course the FTSE 100 hitting another record high does prompt questions about share prices overheating, though the UK's headline index is a poor barometer of the value in the stock market,"" Mr Khalaf added. Market analyst David Madden from CMC Markets UK suggested further gains may be likely. He said: ""The FTSE 100 is comfortably above the 7,500 mark and the upward trend it has been in since mid-September is still intact, so ... the wider bullish move could continue."" The FTSE 250 also ended the day with a record high of 20,472.38 points - up 0.43%. Services sector activity appeared to accelerate to a six-month high in October with a reading of 55.6, up from 53.6 in September, according to the Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI). A reading above 50 is an indicator of growth. It helped sterling rise 0.1% against the US dollar to 1.307 and almost 0.6% against the euro to 1.126."

A reading above 50 indicates growth. Economists had forecast a figure of 53.2 for the sector, which represents more than three-quarters of output. It follows strong performances in both the manufacturing and construction sectors, with the report saying the UK economy was on track for a 0.5% expansion in the final quarter of this year, edging up from 0.4% in the third quarter. The latest services growth is the fastest since April, it said, supported by ""improved order books and resilient client demand"". However, job creation slipped to a seven-month low amid ""squeezed margins"" and a dip in confidence about the economic outlook. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ""While an upturn in business activity growth adds some justification to the Bank of England's decision to hike interest rates for the first time in a decade, a deeper dive into the numbers highlights the fragility of the economy and points to downside risks for the outlook. ""A downturn in business optimism about the year ahead, fuelled mainly by Brexit-related uncertainty, suggests that risks are tilted to the downside as far as future growth is concerned."" The data comes a day after the Bank of England raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to 0.5%. :: Why the Bank of England has raised interest rates Governor Mark Carney signalled that Brexit was at the heart of weaknesses in the economy - driving up inflation through the fall in the pound since the referendum and holding back growth just as expansion elsewhere in the world is accelerating. He said the Bank's next move would be heavily influenced by the progress of talks on Britain's departure from the European Union."

The attack was carried out in coordination with the Somali government. At least six missiles hit Buqa, a mountainous village in the northern state of Puntland, a Somali security official said. The attack may have targeted senior leaders of IS, which has a growing presence in the region. The mayor of nearby Qandala town, Jama Mohamed, confirmed the attack, which he said had terrified locals and sent them fleeing with their animals. America has previously carried out more than a dozen drone strikes against the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group in Somalia. It has a much bigger presence in the country than IS and was blamed for last month's attack in Somali capital Mogadishu, which killed more than 350 people. In May, IS said it was behind a suicide bombing in Puntland state that killed at least four people - thought to be the first time it has claimed an attack in Somalia."

In that short time he has become one of the most infamous fighters on the planet - the undisputed star of UFC - (Ultimate Fighting Championship), a boxer for one extraordinary money-spinning fight (against Floyd Mayweather) and with an Instagram following of 21 million and reportedly five times that in the bank - give or take. As famous for shooting off his mouth and winding up opponents as he is for his actual fighting skills, this is an interview that I'm nervous about. It could go very wrong if I ask a question this fiery Dubliner doesn't like. But as he promotes the documentary Notorious about his life, the man couldn't be nicer. I walk away after the 20 minute sit-down thinking: ""He's a force of nature, a bundle of energy and seems like a very decent, honest guy. I like him - a lot."" He is the first to admit that he often puts his foot in it and says offensive things he regrets in the build-up to a big contest. But he insists it's all him - it's not planned, it's not just for effect, bluster or to sell tickets. What comes out his mouth depends on how he's feeling on the day. And if he offends anyone he seems genuinely sorry and asks for forgiveness from his fans. He explains that the trash talk is a way of getting the psychological upper hand before a fight. He says: ""When you come face to face with someone who's trying to hurt you, maim you for life and drill your head into the ground at 100 miles per hour, you are going to say things."" He recently used a homophobic slur to describe an opponent and when I ask him about this he is contrite. He says he knows he should never have used that word. It is the most passionate part of the interview as he tries to explain that he wasn't thinking about the meaning of it as he said it - he was simply trying to comfort a team-mate who'd just lost a big fight - but chose his words badly in the heat of the moment. McGregor is at pains to point out that he isn't homophobic, not at all. He has gay friends and campaigned for gay marriage in Ireland. Perhaps some words should be deleted from his list of insults now that he is so famous and such a big role model, I suggest. McGregor agrees that this is a good idea but asks his fans to be patient with him and his mistakes. After all, super-stardom and living in the spotlight are still quite new to him. He talks about building an empire and jokes he's like ""a young Rupert Murdoch"". Besides the money he makes from his fights he has his own brand of whiskey, a clothing line and the Mac Life website. But it's the fighting that remains his passion and driving force. It's no longer about the money. As he puts it, he already has ""forever money - it just keeps rallying round up there never to come down"". He laughs at the suggestion he might one day go into politics: ""What do politicians even do? I don't know what they do. ""I do lots of good things already. I help people. ""What does the Irish President earn? â¬150,000 a year? I earn that in less than a week. I'm already the President!"" Not at all bad for a former trainee plumber from Crumlin."

The 17-year-old eventually crashed into another car in Esher, Surrey, and died eight days later. The police car was being driven by PC Paul Rogers, who retired last year after the Crown Prosecution Service opted not to press criminal charges. He was never brought before a misconduct panel. PC Wills, a communications officer with the Met Police, was the passenger in the car, and faced allegations of failing to install the relevant in-car video system, failing to provide an appropriate commentary of the pursuit and removing an exhibit from the collision scene without authority. Inspector Mandy Chamberlain, who arrived after the crash, was alleged to have issued an instruction to delete photographic evidence taken at the scene and withholding evidence from Surrey Police. Now, Met Commander Ivan Balhatchet and a disciplinary panel have ruled ""unprecedented and unexplained"" delays would not allow for a fair hearing. Initially, Surrey Police investigated and found no cause for charges to be brought against the officers. However, Mr Albert's parents, Sharla John and Delroy Albert, made a complaint in 2010. At the teenager's inquest, which concluded in 2011, the jury found that the Met had made a ""material contribution"" to his death and that the chase, which hit speeds of around 118mph, should have been stopped 1.6 miles before the crash. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation began after the inquest. The watchdog has been criticised for the delays. Ms John told the Independent she was ""heartbroken"" by the decision to scrap the misconduct proceedings. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said the decision was not ""taken lightly"". He said: ""A panel has today determined that it would be impossible for the two officers to have a fair hearing given the long history and circumstances of this case. ""It is crucially important for public confidence that police officers are held to account and the sad death of Liam has been investigated twice, through a managed and then independent IPCC inquiry, and fully scrutinised during an inquest. ""Delays to the IPCC investigation were not within the control of the Met. ""While there are often some unavoidable delays in arranging misconduct hearings, we will review what happened in this case and I would like to express our regret to Liam's family if there are things we could have done better."" Mr Albert's family's lawyer has been contacted by Sky News for comment."
2017-11-04,A concerned pensioner alerted police to what he thought was a Second World War bomb in his garden â but the discovery turned out to be a little less terrifying.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/second-world-war-bomb-turns-out-to-be-big-courgette-police-in-germany-confirm-11111870,"Officers called to the property in Bretten, near the southwestern German city of Karlsruh, instead found the 81-year-old's discovery to be a particularly large courgette. In a statement on Friday, officers said the vegetable, which measured 40cm in length, ""really did look very much like a bomb"". The dark-coloured courgette weighed about 5kg and police believe it may have been thrown over into the man's garden over a hedge. Unexploded wartime bombs are often found at German building sites and can cause a lot of disruption, with authorities often forced to evacuate buildings and nearby areas while they are defused. In September, about 60,000 people had to leave their homes in Frankfurt as explosives experts defused a huge wartime bomb. Residents were ordered to leave after the unexploded 1.8-ton British device was found during construction work in a wealthy suburb of the city. It was Germany's biggest evacuation since the Second World War."
2017-11-04,Campaigners are calling for changes to passports to prevent parents and children with different names from being stopped at borders.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/mp-backs-passport-reform-to-stop-parents-with-children-being-delayed-at-borders-11114090,"The long-running campaign is being backed by Labour MP Tulip Siddiq after she spent 45 minutes convincing border officials that the child she was travelling with was her daughter. ""It was quite a confrontational discussion for quite a while,"" she said. ""They demanded different documents, asked collective questions and kept looking at my daughter expecting her to answer but she doesn't talk as she's only a year and a half old."" The Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn whose daughter was given her husband's surname, has backed a petition to include both parent's names on children's passports. She's also written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd who has rejected the idea. Ms Siddiq said: ""If we had a simple change of two names on the passport stating who the mother and father is then we could go through immigration and we wouldn't face these problems."" ""They could spend the extra time stopping criminals."" It's estimated that hundreds of thousands of travellers, mothers in particular, have had problems with passports in the last five years. That number is likely to be on the rise as social attitudes change. A YouGov poll in 2016 found only 59% of women would take their husband's name. That's compared with a similar poll by Eurobarometer into British attitudes in 1994 which said the figure was 94%. Mother of three, Catherine Eden said she was stopped on the way back from a trip to America with her youngest son. She had to convince the border guard that he was hers and is backing the call for passport reform. ""It made me feel a little bit uneasy to have those questions asked about my son,"" she said. ""I knew I wasn't doing anything wrong but it does make you feel as if you might be doing something wrong."" In a statement the Home Office said it had ""no plans to introduce parental details in the observation page of a child's passport"". ""A passport is a travel document, and its fundamental purpose would change if it were to identify a parental relationship,"" it added. ""We have a duty to safeguard children and to prevent people trafficking, child sexual exploitation and other crimes committed against children. ""That is why Border Force staff need to be content that the adult travelling with the child has parental responsibility, or parental authority has been given to travel with the child. ""We aim to do this quickly and with as minimal disruption to passengers as possible."" Jane Greenwood, a 49-year-old mum of three from Suffolk, said she was left ""incredibly angry and deeply humiliated"" by a dispute involving her 12-year-old daughter at Stansted earlier this year. She explained: ""They refused to believe I was her mother because we didn't share the same name and in the end my husband had to be called back from the baggage carousel to 'claim' her. ""I felt incredibly angry and deeply humiliated. I will travel with my children's birth certificates in future but feel furious that I should have to do this."" Sam Bowen claims she is stopped at border control every time she re-enters the UK with her six-year-old daughter. Ms Bowen kept her maiden name and has travelled with her daughter regularly since splitting from her ex-husband. She claimed that on the first occasion she was stopped, five years ago, she was asked ""very uncomfortable"" questions by officers, including why her and her daughter had a different skin colour. Her daughter is often left ""quite distressed by the atmosphere of accusation and suspicion"", even though Ms Bowen has always travelled with a copy of her birth certificate since the initial incident. But she said her experience when leaving the UK is completely different. ""I have travelled with my daughter to a number of countries all over the world and have never been asked to prove her identity when leaving the UK,"" she said. ""This means that she could be taken by anyone, anywhere, so how is this upholding the UK border control's explanation of this treatment, ensuring the safeguarding of the child and minimising child trafficking?"" Australian Maree Wallis, 37, of Kingston upon Thames, was held up when travelling between London and Copenhagen with her son, who was 11 weeks old at the time. She faced additional questioning to confirm they were related upon arriving in Denmark and when they left. Her son, now four years old, and her 18-month-old daughter have surnames that combine her surname with her Spanish husband's and so they always travel with their Spanish 'family book', which is the country's official registration of a couple and their children."

Four forces - Cleveland, Durham, North Yorkshire and Northamptonshire - have no fixed speed cameras in use at all. Staffordshire Police have 272 fixed cameras but just 14 of them are active, while the Derbyshire force operate 112 cameras with just 10 of them switched on. West Yorkshire, Kent, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Cheshire have a quarter or less active. City of London, the Metropolitan Police/Transport for London, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Suffolk and Northern Ireland said all their fixed cameras are in operation. West Midlands Police, who announced in 2013 that their old speed cameras were being switched off, said they now had eight new average speed cameras. The figures cover all police fixed speed cameras, but not the mobile devices forces also use. All the forces that responded said they deployed regular mobile speed cameras across their areas. They also said they regularly review which fixed cameras are turned on. Road safety charity Brake described the figures as concerning and called for all cameras to be switched on. Its director of campaigns, Jason Wakeford, said: ""A staggering 1,800 people lost their lives on British roads last year and speeding is a factor in thousands of crashes. ""Speed cameras are a proven, cost-effective way of reducing deadly collisions and so it's critical they are operational."" AA president Edmund King put the high number of inactive cameras down to pressure on budgets and warned drivers against taking a gamble. ""Drivers who play Russian roulette with fixed-site speed cameras are playing a dangerous game. Our advice is stick to the limits rather than gambling on the yellow boxes,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said the decision to use cameras was ""an operational matter"", adding that ""all forces have individual responsibility for their use of speed cameras""."

The 31-year-old pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy, but on Friday a military judge ruled that he should serve no prison time. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a ""rotten traitor"" and said he ""should have been executed"". Reacting to the serviceman's sentence, the President tweeted: ""The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our country and to our military."" Bergdahl claimed he abandoned his position at Observation Post Mest Malak, Paktika Province, to spark a panic and draw attention to problems with his unit. But his plan to walk to another US base failed within hours as he was located and abducted by Taliban fighters. Bergdahl said he was tortured in captivity and spent years either locked in a cage or chained on all fours. A Navy Seal and an Army National Guard were seriously wounded in attempts to rescue him from his captors - sparking debate in the US over whether efforts to secure his release should be stopped. He was eventually freed in 2014 when former president Barack Obama approved a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. During his military trial, Bergdahl apologised to soldiers injured during rescue efforts. He said: ""I would like everyone who searched for me to know it was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen. ""My words alone can't take away their pain."" A psychiatrist told the hearing that Bergdahl's decision to leave his post was influenced by post-traumatic stress disorder and a schizophrenia-like condition called schizotypal personality disorder. Dr Charles Morgan said the latter condition made it difficult for Bergdahl to understand the consequences of his actions. The serviceman was given a dishonourable discharge, had his rank reduced to private and was ordered to forfeit $10,000 (Â£7,650) in pay over 10 months. Prosecutors had pushed for Bergdahl to be jailed for 14 years. Following the hearing, defence lawyer Eugene Fidell criticised Mr Trump for making ""really extraordinary reprehensible comments targeted directly at our client"". He added that the President helped to create ""one of the most preposterous states of affairs"" in American legal history. Meanwhile, a soldier who was wounded searching for Bergdahl has described the sentence as ""completely unacceptable"". Jonathan Morita, from California, underwent three operations and lost the use of two fingers on his right hand after he was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, which didn't explode. ""I've had better days,"" Mr Morita said. ""He'll pay the fine like people get fined for illegal fishing. ""It should have maybe not been the life sentence, but it should have been something."""
2017-11-04,"The FTSE 100 has closed at a record high of 7,560, a day after the Bank of England raised the interest rate.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/ftse-100-closes-at-record-high-11111761,"Friday's close beat the previous record closing high of 7,556, which the index reached on 12 October. The blue chip index ended the day up by just 0.07% but was enough to break the record high for the second time in a month. Analysts say it was driven partly by the weak pound with listed firms tending to benefit when foreign currencies are stronger. ""The Footsie has climbed this week on the back of a falling pound, as currency markets groaned at the Bank of England's weak expectations for future interest rate rises,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. It follows Thursday's decision by the Bank of England to raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade. The Monetary Policy Committee increased the base rate to 0.5% from 0.25%, where it had been set since the EU referendum. The central bank warned uncertainty presented by the UK's break from Brussels was still weighing on domestic activity and that future hikes would be more ""gradual"". ""Of course the FTSE 100 hitting another record high does prompt questions about share prices overheating, though the UK's headline index is a poor barometer of the value in the stock market,"" Mr Khalaf added. Market analyst David Madden from CMC Markets UK suggested further gains may be likely. He said: ""The FTSE 100 is comfortably above the 7,500 mark and the upward trend it has been in since mid-September is still intact, so ... the wider bullish move could continue."" The FTSE 250 also ended the day with a record high of 20,472.38 points - up 0.43%. Services sector activity appeared to accelerate to a six-month high in October with a reading of 55.6, up from 53.6 in September, according to the Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI). A reading above 50 is an indicator of growth. It helped sterling rise 0.1% against the US dollar to 1.307 and almost 0.6% against the euro to 1.126."
2017-11-04,A British woman detained after flying into Egypt with painkillers for her husband's bad back has been told she could face the death penalty for drug trafficking.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/hull-woman-held-in-egypt-for-taking-painkillers-into-country-11112444,"Laura Plummer was arrested on 9 October after the authorities found she was carrying prescription drugs tramadol and naproxen in her suitcase. The 33-year-old from Hull is said to have been taking 29 strips of the medication to her Egyptian husband Omar, also 33, who has suffered from back pain since an accident. Laura and Omar met four years ago and she flies to Egypt four times a year to visit him. On this occasion, they had planned to enjoy a two-week holiday at a beach resort when Laura was arrested. Laura's mother Roberta, 63, and Laura's sisters, Rachel, 31, and Jayne, 40, have all visited Laura, who is due back in court on Thursday. Laura's mother told The Sun: ""We've been told she's facing either 25 years in prison or the death penalty. We're beside ourselves worrying that they'll make an example of her."" Her sister, Rachel, says Laura is accused of drug trafficking. She told Sky News: ""It's tramadol, to me that's only a painkiller I've taken for a migraine before, to the Egyptians it's equivalent to heroin. It's unbelievable. ""But a drug trafficker to me is a million-pound hidden smuggle, not this. She didn't hide them... they were for no profit as they are worth Â£23."" She says Laura took the painkillers to Egypt for private use, and not to make any money. ""She also had ibuprofen,"" says Rachel. Tramadol is only sold on prescription in the UK and is used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is understood Laura's charges relate to the possession of the tramadol, which is illegal in Egypt, and not the naproxen, which her sister says is not illegal. Naproxen is also a prescription drug that is used to treat inflammation in joints and muscles. ""She is the last person to deserve this, she is guilty of her own stupidity, not for drug trafficking,"" says Rachel. ""The treatment she's receiving in Hurghada prison is beyond disgusting, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."" The Foreign Office has confirmed it is supporting a British woman and her family following her detention in Egypt."

2017-11-04,"As the allegations keep coming thick and fast, the atmosphere in Westminster is febrile.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/sex-pest-scandal-engulfing-westminster-worse-than-expenses-11112503,"I've heard senior figures in both major parties warning darkly that this is worse than the expenses scandal which rocked British politics in 2009. It certainly has many similar elements - a oversight regime which was revealed to be not fit for purpose, a drip-drip of allegations turning into a flood, and the risk that all MPs will be tarred as sex pests due to the behaviour of a small number. :: Fallon quit after No 10 told of sex assault claim The veteran Conservative MP Gary Streeter hit an unwelcome nerve for many in his party when he warned on Twitter that this felt like the John Major years - ""no majority, no money, ripping ourselves apart over the EU. That lasted five years. Oh dear"". Twenty years later, there are fears in the party that yet again the Conservatives could again be riven apart on Europe and then destroyed by sleaze. It's hard to believe that this barely began a week ago, when it was reported in a newspaper that a Whatsapp group of female Parliamentary staff were sharing experiences about inappropriate behaviour. Within days the scandal had reached Theresa May's government with the trade minister Mark Garnier the first to be accused and defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday, the first scalp to be claimed. :: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline Few in the Conservative party now think his resignation will be the last, in a scandal which threatens to derail not just the reputation of politics, but the delicate Cabinet balance Mrs May relies on to keep her fragile administration together. That her key ally, the de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green is under investigation over claims by the writer Kate Maltby that he touched her knee and wrote her an inappropriate text message, will be a source of worry to No 10. Developments in the Labour party are if anything even more serious, with the allegation by activist Bex Bailey that she was raped by a senior party figure and advised against reporting it by party officials. NEC member Jasmin Beckett has told Sky News that more victims were waiting in the wings, and called on her party to help them come forward. Allegations have already resulted in the suspension of Corbyn ally Kelvin Hopkins, 76, over claims - stringently denied - that he inappropriately touched an activist 50 years his junior; and an investigation into Clive Lewis, who denies he groped a woman at the party's conference. Both men served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. In fact Mr Hopkins was promoted to shadow culture secretary last summer, months after the leader's office was made aware that he had been reprimanded for sending the activist a suggestive text message. The senior Labour MPs, as well as Mr Green, are adamant that the allegations are untrue, and Mr Lewis even accused his accuser of lying. There is deep anger in Westminster at the way these allegations are coming out because, at least in part as a result of the failure of the political parties' processes, victims are instead going public before due process can take place. A list of around 40 Conservative MPs compiled by party staff, and circulating on social media, has been blamed for muddying the waters between MPs having affairs or relationships with colleagues; along with unsubstantiated accusations of harassment. Some MPs on the list have already come out to denounce the claims as lies, such as the Penrith MP Rory Stewart, whose researcher has backed him up. But as both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn scramble to get a grip on the scandal, events are moving fast. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party on Friday night and serious allegations referred to the police, responded angrily that the media were told about his suspension before he was and that he was not aware of the claim. The Prime Minister has issued a new code of conduct and allegations hotline for all representatives of her party, and the Labour leader said an independent specialist organisation would be appointed to handle complaints in the future. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the ""dam has broken"" in Westminster, according to Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said it was time for the ""male-dominated professionsâ¦where the boys' own locker room culture has prevailed"" to clean up. Westminster is not a normal work environment. MPs hire their own staff - often plucked from thousands who want to work at the heart of politics - and those staff can expect a different work culture depending on whether their boss is a 30-year-old, who has come from a career in business, or a 70-year-old, who has been in politics for decades. Drinking and socialising in Parliament's bars, but also away on by-elections and party conferences, can be part and parcel. Few MPs doubt that this is a watershed moment for the behaviour of parliamentarians and how Westminster is scrutinised. It is hoped that higher standards of conduct will eventually result. But as with expenses, things could get a lot worse before they get better."

It has now emerged that a third allegation was made against him within a week, after he apologised for putting his hand on journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer's knee during a Conservative party conference 15 years ago; and he was accused of making lewd remarks - which he denies - to Cabinet colleague Andrea Leadsom. The sexual assault claim was revealed to The Times by former minister Anna Soubry who said that a ""person with great courage"" had presented their allegation to No 10 on Wednesday, shortly before Sir Michael's resignation. :: Tory MP Charlie Elphicke suspended over 'serious allegations':: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline ""Theresa May made it very clear she took these allegations seriously and within hours he was gone"", said Conservative MP Ms Soubry who had served as Sir Michael's junior at the Ministry of Defence until the 2015 election. Sir Michael has issued a strong denial saying the claim was not true and libellous. He said: ""I've already accepted that I have behaved inappropriately in the past but I have never assaulted anybody"". He said no specific allegation was put to him. Downing Street declined to comment this morning. It comes amid a deepening rift in the Conservative party about the claims made by Mrs Leadsom, the Leader of the Commons. Ms Soubry said ""somebody has betrayed Andrea Leadsom's confidence"" by leaking the accusation. But others in the party accused the former leadership contender of an act of revenge against Sir Michael after he is said to have suggested she would have to be sacked to get Cabinet agreement on a Brexit deal. A minister told the Daily Telegraph: ""She knifed him (Fallon) to make sure she couldn't be sacked because no-one is going to sack a whistleblower"". Mrs Leadsom has not commented on the allegations. But Downing Street has issued a statement, saying Mrs Leadsom had not called for Sir Michael's position to be considered. Those close to Mrs Leadsom say they are dismayed she is under attack from her colleagues in a way that is ""overlooking the bigger matters at hand""."

But the good news is that by Saturday evening - when the majority of bonfire parties take place - most of the rain should have cleared up leaving a cold, clear evening for outdoor fun. :: Latest weather forecast Sky News weather producer Joanna Robinson said: ""It is set to turn much colder this weekend so it's time to dig out the hats, scarves and gloves."" ""There will be showers across north-west Scotland, Wales and western England on Friday evening, with some fog also popping up in parts of central and southeast England.""

In addition to the nippy weather, fog may also be a problem in some areas by Sunday night, made worse by the previous night's displays. Joanna Robinson explains: ""Smoke particles from bonfires and fireworks are hygroscopic, which means they attract water from the atmosphere, therefore encouraging fog to form at lower humidity levels than in clean air."" And it's not just fireworks lighting up the night sky this weekend, with a Hunter's Moon rising on Friday and Saturday. The second supermoon of the year, it will appear bigger and brighter than usual as it orbits closer to Earth, and is best seen around midnight on Saturday when the moon is at its height."

2017-11-04,"A bigger and brighter moon will shine over Earth this weekend, in the second supermoon of the year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/hunters-moon-when-and-where-to-see-supermoon-this-weekend-11111724,"Hunter's Moon - also known as a Beaver moon, a Frosty moon and a Snow moon - will light up the night sky as it travels closer to Earth, appearing about 30% brighter and 14% bigger as it comes more than 12,700 miles nearer than usual. The Hunter's Moon will be visible on Friday and Saturday night, and at peak full phase at 5.23am on Saturday. A supermoon is the name given to the phenomenon when the moon is both full and closer to the Earth than normal. Due to the fact it does not orbit the sun in a perfect circle, instead moving in a slight oval, it can move closer or further to Earth depending on the point of its course. Tom Kerss, astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich, said he expected it to be ""a really beautiful sight"", adding that the best time to see it would be around midnight on Saturday when the moon is at its highest. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ''On Saturday there will be cloudy skies and outbreaks of rain across the majority of England and Wales, but by Saturday night the rain should clear off into the North Sea, allowing for clear skies to develop across many central and eastern parts of the UK. ""Those areas will have the best chance of seeing the supermoon, and it'll also be good for those going to watch firework displays. ""Western parts of the UK and Ireland will have cloudier skies and showers through Saturday night, so unfortunately a good view of the moon is less likely across the west''. The next supermoon will rise on 3 December, with the Hunter's Moon of 2016 - which was the largest in 70 years - not set to be surpassed in size until 2034. Facts about the moon :: The moon orbits Earth every 27.5 days and the same side always faces us. :: It is moving away from us at 3.8cm a year - which means that in 50 million years, it will take 47 days to orbit Earth. :: The moon is 2,159 miles in diameter - the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system. :: Just 24 people - all US astronauts - have seen the far side of the moon with their own eyes. :: Only 12 people have walked on it (but not for 44 years). :: You would weigh just 16.5% of your Earth weight on the moon because it has a much smaller mass and a weaker gravitational pull. :: NASA plans to return to the moon with a human mission around 2019."

Officers seized 24 million tablets in the port of Gioia Tauro in southern Italy. The shipment was on its way to Libya from India when it was intercepted by authorities. The tablets contained the drug tramadol, a strong painkiller used by doctors to treat moderate to severe pain. It has been nicknamed ""the drug of fighters"" because of its use by jihadist fighters in the Middle East. Militants are thought to use the painkiller to dull pain and suppress fatigue. Italian investigators said the group would sell the drug to soldiers for a price of around two euros a tablet. ""The traffic of tramadol is directly handled by IS to finance terrorist activities planned and carried out across the world,"" said an Italian court in the city of Reggio Calabria. Some of the money raised from the sales would also go ""to subsidise terrorist groups and extremists operating in Libya, Syria and Iraq,"" it said in a statement. The interception came six months after a similar shipment of 37 million tablets was seized by authorities in Genoa in May. The court said the operation was possible thanks in part to input from the US Drug Enforcement Administration."

At around 6pm on Thursday, the fast food delivery driver was approached by two men on a scooter in Walpole Road. The men attempted to steal the victim's moped and police believe a corrosive substance was then repeatedly thrown into the his face. The victim, a 32-year-old man, was treated at the scene and taken to an east London hospital. Detective chief inspector Gordon Henderson said: ""This attack has left a man fighting for his life and with terrible eye injuries. ""This was an innocent man going about his work as a delivery driver, who may never see again. ""This is not a time to hesitate - if you have any information about this crime I would appeal that you immediately call police."" Police are also investigating an identical acid attack which occurred around half an hour later, in Yarmouth Crescent in Tottenham, north London. The second victim, also a 32-year-old delivery driver, was approached by two men on a scooter who attempted to steal his moped and sprayed a corrosive substance on his face. The victim was taken to hospital but his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or life-changing. It is not yet known if the two attacks are linked, but it is an active line of inquiry and detectives in Tottenham and Waltham Forest are working together."

The last stretch needed brute force and shovels to dismantle the ""rock hard"" fatberg and it was ""gut-wrenching work"", said Thames Water's Alex Saunders. It formed under the streets of Whitechapel, east London, damaging the one-metre-wide sewer as it grew. Eight people used high-powered jet hoses to break up the 250m fatberg before sucking it out of the sewer and into tankers. ""Our work is finished, and the beast finally defeated after a mammoth effort from the team,"" said Mr Saunders. The message is 'Bin it - don't block it', and Thames Water is reminding people that ""poo, pee and toilet paper are the only things that should ever be flushed down the toilet"". Cooking fat, oil and grease should also not be poured down the plughole. Instead, water companies recommend using something like an old jam jar or butter tub to collect it when cooled, before emptying it into the rubbish. In September the Museum of London said it would like to display part of the fatberg because it ""would raise questions about how we live today and also inspire our visitors to consider solutions to the problems of growing metropolises""."

The attack may have targeted senior leaders of IS, which has a growing presence in the region. The mayor of nearby Qandala town, Jama Mohamed, confirmed the attack, which he said had terrified locals and sent them fleeing with their animals. America has previously carried out more than a dozen drone strikes against the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group in Somalia. It has a much bigger presence in the country than IS and was blamed for last month's attack in Somali capital Mogadishu, which killed more than 350 people. In May, IS said it was behind a suicide bombing in Puntland state that killed at least four people - thought to be the first time it has claimed an attack in Somalia."

Hundreds gathered outside applauded as her coffin was carried into the church, and Archbishop Charles Scicluna warned the journalist's murderers: ""However hard you try to evade from the justice of men, you will never escape from the justice of God."" Mourners included Ms Caruana Galizia's husband, her three adult sons and European Parliament President Antonio Tajani. Malta's top politicians stayed away at the request of her family, who have criticised the government for not dealing with the corruption she covered in her blog, Running Commentary. Ms Caruana Galizia also wrote twice a week for the Malta Independent and at the time of her death was being sued in 42 libel cases. Witnesses described seeing two explosions coming from her car and the vehicle skidding down the road at high speed, before ending up in fire in a field. Her son, Matthew Caruana Galizia, said he found his mother's body in pieces. The assassination sparked outrage in Malta, and among many journalists and politicians in Europe and worldwide, who view it as an attack on free speech. Archbishop Scicluna used his funeral address to make a direct appeal for Ms Caruana Galizia's contemporaries to continue her work. ""Dear journalists, we need you,"" he said. ""We need people in your profession who are unshackled, who are free, intelligent, inquisitive, honest, serene, safe and protected."" People outside the church sang the national anthem and clapped as the coffin was carried out by Ms Caruana Galizia's sons. The journalist's articles probed issues such as government officials named in the Panama Papers leaks, Malta's reputation as a tax haven, and links with Libya. Europol, the EU law enforcement agency, has confirmed it has sent three experts to the Mediterranean island to help investigate. ""They are working directly with the investigation team established by Malta police and their task is to support the investigation wherever it may lead,"" said Europol spokesman Jan Op Gen Oorth. Police are looking at similarities with five other unsolved car bombings in Malta over the last two years. Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, often a target of Caruana Galizia's articles, has vowed no stone will be left unturned, and has offered a â¬1m (Â£890,000) reward to bring her killers to justice. However, the journalist's family issued a stinging response last week on Facebook. It said: ""A government and a police force that failed our mother in life will also fail her in death. The people who for as long as we can remember sought to silence our mother cannot now be the ones to deliver justice."""
2017-11-04,It is hard to think of another Bank of England decision that is simultaneously as momentous and as inconsequential as this one.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/who-are-the-winners-and-losers-if-the-bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-11108804,"The mere fact that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to raise interest rates this month is a landmark moment all of its own. It would be the first time rates have been lifted in a decade - a watershed after a period in which borrowing costs dropped to the lowest level on record. And for many economists, it is only the start of a long road that might take rates back up towards a more normal level (though this will almost certainly be lower than the pre-crisis ""normal"" of about 5%). But, on the basis of other measures, an interest rate rise is likely to have little impact. In part that is because, for all the headlines recently about levels of indebtedness, Britons' overall household debt levels have actually dropped a fair bit in recent years. A decade ago in the summer of 2007, the last time the Bank raised rates, the average UK household had Â£1.44 of debt for every pound of savings they had in the bank. Today, that ratio has dropped to Â£1.13 of debt for every pound of savings. Yes, that number has started to rise recently thanks to an increase in consumer credit lending, but only very slightly - and it is a long way shy of its pre-crisis peak. :: Interest rate rise looms next month after lift in economic growth Then there's the question of how many people will feel an instant impact of the Bank's decision - the ""transmission mechanism"", to use the economic terminology. Here, too, things have changed. Five years ago, 73% of the population had floating rate mortgages - in other words, loans where rates would instantly go up by 0.25% or near enough as soon as the Bank did likewise. Today, only 43% of mortgage holders have floating rate loans - the lowest proportion in history. That's the total stock of loans across the UK, many of which will be smaller loans. The reality for recent homebuyers (the ones with the bigger loans) is even more stark in the most recent quarter. A whopping 94% of mortgages were issued with fixed rates - the highest proportion in history. Long story short: fewer people than ever before will be affected on day one. None of this is to say that higher interest rates won't take their toll. It just underlines that the impact will be gradual and subtle, rather than immediate. But as anyone who has experienced debt problems before will know, that is precisely the way individual debt problems mount. :: Interest rate rise should not be feared, says Bank of England economist You face a short-term problem - say your rent going up, your job being lost or hours being cut, and you borrow a little bit to tide you over. Then things get worse, not better. Your debt costs rack up further and you find yourself mired in debt you can no longer see an escape from. It is a lonely, miserable experience, and something many families in the country struggle with. And that is the important point about rising interest rates. The Bank is not worried about a nationwide debt crisis, or an abrupt implosion of demand as it increases the cost of borrowing. However, it is concerned about small pockets of trouble across the country. In particular, low income households are likely to be most exposed - families who have had to borrow to absorb the cost of rising food and fuel prices, who have seen their real wages slide, and are now facing extra pressure from the benefits squeeze. It is they who will be most affected by rising rates. Again, this may not happen overnight: indeed, of all the interest rates out there in the market, those on credit cards and payday loans are perhaps least affected by Bank rate itself. But any increase in the cost of borrowing is unlikely to help. Finally, what about savers? Well, this is where things get interesting. On the one hand, savers have had a torrid time over the past few years - especially those expecting to live off the interest on their savings. On the other hand, the vast majority of other asset prices have gone up dramatically in that period: share prices, house prices (although mostly house prices in London), bond prices. Moreover, savers have benefited from an unusual phenomenon in recent years. Most of the time, the interest rates you're paid on your savings is below the official Bank rate. For instance, between 1999 and 2008, the average rate on an instant access savings account was 2.2 percentage points below the official Bank rate - and the rate on a long-term savings account was 0.6% below Bank rate. Since the crisis, the average instant access savings account has paid 0.24 percentage points above Bank rate while the average long-term account has paid 1.66 percentage points above the official rate. This is largely down to the fact that Britain's banks have spent this period trying to rebuild their balance sheets by attempting to lure in new customer deposits. In other words, while it hasn't been a great time to be a saver, it hasn't been quite as bad as the official Bank rate suggests. Which raises another question: if and when the official rate starts going up, do the savings rates themselves also increase, or do they stay where they are?"

""Where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behaviour might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions,"" he said. Mr McDonald added that he considered his behaviour ""entirely my responsibility"" and said that, ""in light of my position in government... it would not be appropriate to continue to serve in my role in the Scottish Government"". ""I hope that in taking this step, neither any particular woman, or my family, will be the focus of undue and unwarranted scrutiny,"" he added. ""It has been an honour to serve in the Scottish Government and I will continue to serve my constituents in Aberdeen Donside to the best of my ability.""

2017-11-04,Jane Merrick has accused former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon of trying to kiss her on the lips when she was a junior reporter.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/michael-fallon-accused-of-sexually-harassing-journalist-11114235,"Following Wednesday's resignation, Ms Merrick informed Downing Street that Sir Michael lunged at her when she was a political reporter with the Daily Mail in 2003. Ms Merrick told the Observer that, following the incident, she ""shrank away in horror"" and ""ran off"" to her office in the Press Gallery. ""I felt humiliated, ashamed,"" she told the newspaper on Saturday. ""Was I even guilty that maybe I led him on in some way by drinking with him?"" she asked. ""After years of having drinks with so many other MPs who have not acted inappropriately towards me, I know I was not."" A friend of Sir Michael has told Sky News the former defence secretary ""realises this kind of incident was unacceptable, which is why he resigned"". Following the resignation, Sir Michael said that his personal conduct had ""fallen below the high standards we require of the armed forces"". :: Scottish minister Mark McDonald resigns over 'inappropriate behaviour' This is the fourth allegation made against him within a week, after he apologised for putting his hand on journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer's knee during a Conservative party conference 15 years ago; and he was accused of making lewd remarks - which he denies - to Cabinet colleague Andrea Leadsom. The sexual assault claim was revealed to The Times by former minister Anna Soubry who said that a ""person with great courage"" had presented their allegation to No 10 on Wednesday, shortly before Sir Michael's resignation. :: Tory MP Charlie Elphicke suspended over 'serious allegations' ""Theresa May made it very clear she took these allegations seriously and within hours he was gone"", said Conservative MP Ms Soubry who had served as Sir Michael's junior at the Ministry of Defence until the 2015 election. Sir Michael has issued a strong denial saying the claim was not true and libellous. He said: ""I've already accepted that I have behaved inappropriately in the past but I have never assaulted anybody"". He said no specific allegation was put to him. It comes amid a deepening rift in the Conservative party about the claims made by Mrs Leadsom, the Leader of the Commons. Ms Soubry said ""somebody has betrayed Andrea Leadsom's confidence"" by leaking the accusation. But others in the party accused the former leadership contender of an act of revenge against Sir Michael after he is said to have suggested she would have to be sacked to get Cabinet agreement on a Brexit deal. Ms Merrick said she decided to name Sir Michael after he ""denied some allegations, and minimised others as somehow acceptable because they date from another time"". ""His lack of contrition has made me change my mind,"" she said. According to the Observer, this latest revelation was a tipping point for Downing Street, which was already compiling a list of incidents relating to Mr Fallon. The wave of sexual harassment allegations sweeping Westminster is showing little sign of easing. The Mail on Sunday reported that Tory whip Chris Pincher had been accused of making an unwanted pass at former Olympic rower and Conservative activist Alex Story. Mr Pincher told the newspaper: ""If Mr Story has ever felt offended by anything I said then I can only apologise to him."" First Secretary of State Damian Green has strongly denied claims by a former police chief that pornographic material was found on one of his Commons computers. The Sunday Times reported that ex-Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick alleged the material was discovered by officers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008. Mr Green said: ""This story is completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source."""

2017-11-04,"When he was five years old, Nathan Forrest Winters dreamt of being a star. By 11 he had the leading role in a film called Clownhouse.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171104222134/http://news.sky.com/story/former-child-actors-reveal-sexual-abuse-in-hollywood-11110821,"It was a low-budget horror film directed by Victor Salva and financed by Francis Ford Coppola. Behind the scenes, something truly disturbing was happening. ""Some of the cast and crew came to my mum and said 'Nathan and Victor's interaction on set is not ok, there's something going on',"" Winters, 39, told Sky News. The former child star said Salva had been grooming him since he was six after he befriended Winters' mother who made film props. He said: ""His grooming process was developing my love and trust. Developing my parents' trust. :: Hollywood sex abuse: Are the kids alright? ""Essentially he became a close friend of the family and it turned from 'How about I take Nathan for a few hours tonight, give you guys a break' into full weekends at his house."" Winters said Salva invited him to stay at his apartment, where they watched Disney's The Jungle Book together. ""He started talking about Mowgli's loin cloth so that he could make me one,"" he said. ""He got two bandanas and tied them together and made this loin cloth and as he's tying them, he's fondling me. And that's my first memory of when the abuse started. ""It progressed over the next five years... For him, everything was sexual. He videotaped all of it, it was full-blown."" When Winters' family found out, they went to the police. Salva was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison, but served less than half. Winters says the process of going through the courts was traumatic and intimidating. ""He had a nice expensive lawyer... There were people watching us. I think there's no other intent than to make us aware that we were being watched, to intimidate us and scare us off,"" he said. As a convicted paedophile, Salva is on the sex offenders register but it hasn't stopped him working in Hollywood. Powder, one of the scripts he wrote in prison, was distributed by Disney's Buena Vista Pictures. He has also directed the Jeepers Creepers franchise. Winters, however, was told he would never work in the industry again. ""I was basically black balled for telling the truth. He's been coddled completely, big names in Hollywood have been backing him throughout the entire process. Seems like there's an exclusive club and Victor's part of that club."" When the Weinstein scandal broke, we predicted more allegations about other powerful Hollywood players would surface. Some have been more surprising and shocking than others, but we were horrified at how little we had to scratch the surface to uncover stories of paedophilia in Hollywood. For decades, former teen idol Corey Feldman has been met with varying levels of scepticism in speaking out about the abuse he suffered by Hollywood paedophiles - along with his friend Corey Haim who, before he died, said he was raped aged 11. Starring together in 1987's The Lost Boys, they were two of the biggest child stars in the Eighties. But it seems finding the courage to go public about their abuse hasn't been enough to encourage others to dare to come forward. ""Right off the bat I can name six names, one of them who is still very powerful today, and a story that links all the way up to a studio, it connects paedophilia to one of the major studios,"" Feldman said in a video he posted on Twitter in October. US sexual abuse lawyer Jeff Herman told us the problem is staggering. ""I've heard many stories of kids going to an agent who can control their career, the agents spending time alone with the child, they're able to get them away without parental supervision, and then they take advantage of these kids. It's more common than we can even imagine,"" he said. ""I've heard stories from adults who were abused as kids in Hollywood who've talked to me about going to these industry events where there are multiple men there exchanging information about kids, it's frightening,"" he added. Child abuse experts in Los Angeles say they treat 200-300 cases of sexual abuse every year. As part of a two-month operation targeting child predators in Southern California, LA Police made 238 arrests in 2016. Commanding Officer at the LA Police Department Juvenile Division Paul Espinosa told us it's much harder to detect abuse among minors. ""It takes that inner strength to come forward. Now, with children that inner strength is not the same as with adults,"" he said. It's a concern echoed by lawyer Jeff Herman: ""They feel like they've done something wrong, they feel guilty, and it's very difficult to come and talk about it because you're not even sure if you're a victim."" Star of 1970s US sitcom Diff'rent Strokes Todd Bridges, who was molested by his publicist, told us that abuse has destroyed countless lives in Hollywood. ""I'm one of the few children who's still around. Pretty much every one of my protÃ©gÃ©s have died or committed suicide or OD'd, you know, because they couldn't get over the stuff that happened to them,"" he said. ""At the time that it was going on, 11 to 12, I didn't know what I was. As a little kid you don't know what you are, I'd never had sexual encounters or anything and when that man did it to me, he'd groomed me very well."" Hollywood writer Tony Hawkins points out that while children are particularly vulnerable, the power imbalance is heightened further by the fact many film industry people have a huge amount of influence. ""These people throw money at the problem, whether it's paying people off or hiring a team of lawyers, powerful people use money as a shield and this is why all these people stay silent, it's a very hard and powerful thing to fight."" One of the most disturbing aspects of the Weinstein scandal is the people around him who were complicit in protecting the producer, keeping quiet about accusations of sexual assault and rape - which Weinstein denies. The domino effect of people coming forward with allegations of misconduct by other powerful figures has been astonishing as people feel empowered to share their horrifying allegations. Tyler Grasham, an agent for one of the stars of Stranger Things, was fired after being accused of raping an 18-year-old. With allegations mounting, Kevin Spacey has apologised to actor Anthony Rapp for sexual harassment when he was 14. And the Weinstein controversy has prompted fresh attacks over why Roman Polanski continues to be decorated with industry awards - despite a conviction for raping a 13-year-old. The power that comes with fame seems to make some untouchable - a fact that comes as no surprise to Hollywood writer Tony Horkins. ""If we look at historically at what's been going on, how long ago was it that Mel Gibson was completely derided in this town and he's now being lauded for his work. We've seen these scandals for Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, scandals become very public and then a few years later they're being given more money for projects."" This selective amnesia is further evidenced in the case of Brian Peck. In 2004 the actor was convicted of sex with a child. But just two years later he got a role on the kids' show The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody, and has since been working as a dialogue coach on Anger Management. When we queried whether Peck's inclusion on the sex offenders register was considered when hiring him on Anger Management, someone close to the show, who wishes to remain anonymous, told us the decision to hire him was taken by the show's star Charlie Sheen. A cast member had complained when they found out about Peck's background and an investigation had been conducted, but as Peck had served his time, the recommendation was that he could be allowed to stay on set providing no children were present and if his time off set was limited to Sheen's trailer. Lawyer Jeff Herman warns what Hollywood is seeing now is just the beginning. ""You just have to look at what's happening with young women, we know they're not being protected so what makes us think that anyone else is being protected? This is opening up, I think, a big can of worms for Hollywood."" Winters hopes people will now find strength in one another to speak out. ""Whether you're a woman, man, child or adult abuse is abuse and victims and survivors should all band together. ""There's strength in numbers and I'm really hoping that through this exposure more people will come forward."" In covering this story, there was one thing Bridges said that has stayed with us this week: ""When you realise it's wrong, they say you're lying."" You can't quite imagine the enormity of what it must be like to go through something as harrowing as he did as a child - to be too scared to tell anyone, and when you finally find the courage to speak up, you are ignored, dismissed, discredited or paid off. So it begs the question whether this will be enough of a catalyst to finally force Hollywood to oust its abusers."

His body was collected from the mortuary at Royal Liverpool hospital by a Tameside Council official at around 9pm on 25 October, court documents show. The corpse was then taken with a police escort to Southport Crematorium, where the cremation took place at 10pm without music or flowers. Brady's ashes were placed in a weighted biodegradable urn, driven to Liverpool Marina and dispatched at sea on Thursday at 2.30am. In the 1960s, Brady tortured and murdered five children along with Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002. There had been fears his remains would be scattered on Saddleworth Moor - where the couple buried four of their victims. Brady and Hindley were convicted of luring children and teenagers to their deaths. Their victims were sexually tortured before being buried on the moor in the south Pennines. Pauline Reade, 16, disappeared on her way to a disco on 12 July 1963, and John Kilbride was snatched four months later. Keith Bennett was taken on 16 June 1964, after going to visit his grandmother; Lesley Ann Downey, 10, was lured from a Boxing Day funfair the same year; and Edward Evans, 17, was killed in October 1965. Brady was given whole life sentences for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward. He died at Ashworth High Security Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, where he had been locked up since 1985. Hindley was convicted of killing Lesley Ann and Edward and shielding Brady after John's murder. She was jailed for life. They both later confessed to the murders of Pauline - whose body was found in 1987 - and Keith. His body has never been discovered. In a statement, Tameside and Oldham councils said: ""We are pleased that this matter is now concluded and we are grateful for the support and professionalism shown... to ensure Ian Stewart-Brady's body and remains were disposed of expediently at sea in a manner compatible with the public interest and those of the victim's relatives."""

The cladding is suspected to have helped the blaze spread through the tower in June, killing an estimate 80 people. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service were called to Arconic's plant in Exeter on Saturday, after reports of a fire in the casting plant at its foundry section. Eight fire engines were sent to tackle the accidental blaze which spread to the roof of the factory before being extinguished. ""Due to the potential serious nature of this incident and knowledge of the type of building involved, fire control made the decision to redirect fire appliances from other lower priority incidents in the area to ensure fire service resources were in attendance as soon as possible,"" a statement from fire service said. The factory's furnace area was damaged by the fire and smoke, but no-one was injured. The DevonLive website says the Exeter plant casts precision parts for the aerospace industry. In June, Arconic announced it was stopping global sales of Reynobond PE cladding for tall buildings, citing concerns about the ""inconsistency of building codes across the world"". Following the Grenfell disaster, the UK government carried out cladding tests on hundreds of high-rise blocks, which led to some of them being removed and replaced."

The Hunter's Moon will peak full phase at 5.23am on Saturday. A supermoon is the name given to the phenomenon when the moon is both full and closer to the Earth than normal. Due to the fact it does not orbit the sun in a perfect circle, instead moving in a slight oval, it can move closer or further to Earth depending on the point of its course. Tom Kerss, astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich, said he expected it to be ""a really beautiful sight"", adding that the best time to see it would be around midnight on Saturday when the moon is at its highest. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ''On Saturday there will be cloudy skies and outbreaks of rain across the majority of England and Wales, but by Saturday night the rain should clear off into the North Sea, allowing for clear skies to develop across many central and eastern parts of the UK. ""Those areas will have the best chance of seeing the supermoon, and it'll also be good for those going to watch firework displays. ""Western parts of the UK and Ireland will have cloudier skies and showers through Saturday night, so unfortunately a good view of the moon is less likely across the west."" The next supermoon will rise on 3 December, with the Hunter's Moon of 2016 - which was the largest in 70 years - not set to be surpassed in size until 2034. Facts about the moon :: The moon orbits Earth every 27.5 days and the same side always faces us. :: It is moving away from us at 3.8cm a year - which means that in 50 million years, it will take 47 days to orbit Earth. :: The moon is 2,159 miles in diameter - the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system. :: Just 24 people - all US astronauts - have seen the far side of the moon with their own eyes. :: Only 12 people have walked on it (but not for 44 years). :: You would weigh just 16.5% of your Earth weight on the moon because it has a much smaller mass and a weaker gravitational pull. :: NASA plans to return to the moon with a human mission around 2019."

The last stretch needed brute force and shovels to dismantle the ""rock hard"" fatberg and it was ""gut-wrenching work"", said Thames Water's Alex Saunders. It formed under the streets of Whitechapel, east London, damaging the one-metre-wide sewer as it grew. Eight people used high-powered jet hoses to break up the 250m fatberg before sucking it out of the sewer and into tankers. ""Our work is finished, and the beast finally defeated after a mammoth effort from the team,"" said Mr Saunders. The message is 'Bin it - don't block it', and Thames Water is reminding people that ""poo, pee and toilet paper are the only things that should ever be flushed down the toilet"". Cooking fat, oil and grease should also not be poured down the plughole. Instead, water companies recommend using something like an old jam jar or butter tub to collect it when cooled, before emptying it into the rubbish. In September the Museum of London said it would like to display part of the fatberg because it ""would raise questions about how we live today and also inspire our visitors to consider solutions to the problems of growing metropolises""."

In that short time he has become one of the most infamous fighters on the planet - the undisputed star of UFC - (Ultimate Fighting Championship), a boxer for one extraordinary money-spinning fight (against Floyd Mayweather) and with an Instagram following of 21 million and reportedly five times that in the bank - give or take. As famous for shooting off his mouth and winding up opponents as he is for his actual fighting skills, this is an interview that I'm nervous about. It could go very wrong if I ask a question this fiery Dubliner doesn't like. But as he promotes the documentary Notorious about his life, the man couldn't be nicer. I walk away after the 20 minute sit-down thinking: ""He's a force of nature, a bundle of energy and seems like a very decent, honest guy. I like him - a lot."" He is the first to admit that he often puts his foot in it and says offensive things he regrets in the build-up to a big contest. But he insists it's all him - it's not planned, it's not just for effect, bluster or to sell tickets. What comes out his mouth depends on how he's feeling on the day. And if he offends anyone he seems genuinely sorry and asks for forgiveness from his fans. He explains that the trash talk is a way of getting the psychological upper hand before a fight. He says: ""When you come face to face with someone who's trying to hurt you, maim you for life and drill your head into the ground at 100 miles per hour, you are going to say things."" He recently used a homophobic slur to describe an opponent and when I ask him about this he is contrite. He says he knows he should never have used that word. It is the most passionate part of the interview as he tries to explain that he wasn't thinking about the meaning of it as he said it - he was simply trying to comfort a team-mate who'd just lost a big fight - but chose his words badly in the heat of the moment. McGregor is at pains to point out that he isn't homophobic, not at all. He has gay friends and campaigned for gay marriage in Ireland. Perhaps some words should be deleted from his list of insults now that he is so famous and such a big role model, I suggest. McGregor agrees that this is a good idea but asks his fans to be patient with him and his mistakes. After all, super-stardom and living in the spotlight are still quite new to him. He talks about building an empire and jokes he's like ""a young Rupert Murdoch"". Besides the money he makes from his fights he has his own brand of whiskey, a clothing line and the Mac Life website. But it's the fighting that remains his passion and driving force. It's no longer about the money. As he puts it, he already has ""forever money - it just keeps rallying round up there never to come down"". He laughs at the suggestion he might one day go into politics: ""What do politicians even do? I don't know what they do. ""I do lots of good things already. I help people. ""What does the Irish President earn? â¬150,000 a year? I earn that in less than a week. I'm already the President!"" Not at all bad for a former trainee plumber from Crumlin."

In the book, he and his son George W, both former presidents of the US, talk about why they think their Republican successor is not fit for office. According to reports, Mr Bush Snr told the author in May last year: ""I don't like (Trump). ""I don't know much about him but I know he's a blowhard. ""And I'm not too excited about him being a leader."" Mr Bush Snr, 93, and his son, 71, were the 41st and 43rd presidents of the US, both Republicans and split by Democrat Bill Clinton. The book follows a speech by George W Bush in which he warned that bigotry, white supremacy and falsehoods were coarsening the tone of the US and threatening its democracy. In the speech in New York last month, Mr Bush Jr did not mention the president by name but he was clearly criticising the current administration and its policies. Mr Bush Jr left his ballot blank in the election and said in the book that Mr Trump ""doesn't know what it means to be president"". He said he had been surprised Mr Trump had won the election, also expressing surprise in his lack of humility and inability to recognise his own limitations. He said: ""As you know from looking at my family, (humility) is a certain heritage, that's what they expect and we're not seeing that (in Trump). He also said Mr Trump had failed to surround himself with more knowledgeable people, a key part of being president. After Mr Trump had described himself as his own adviser, Mr Bush had said: ""Wow, this guy really doesn't understand the job of president"". Mr Updegrove said the younger Bush had inspired the title of his book, sharing a fear before the election that he would be ""the last Republican president"". White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement: ""The American people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change - instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests. ""If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won."" Mr Bush Jr also refuted claims that his vice president Dick Cheney and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld had controlled the White House from behind the scenes, telling Mr Updegrove that they ""didn't make one f*****g decision""."
2017-11-05,Campaigners are calling for changes to passports to prevent parents and children with different names from being stopped at borders.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171105234721/http://news.sky.com/story/mp-backs-passport-reform-to-stop-parents-with-children-being-delayed-at-borders-11114090,"The long-running campaign is being backed by Labour MP Tulip Siddiq after she spent 45 minutes convincing border officials that the child she was travelling with was her daughter. ""It was quite a confrontational discussion for quite a while,"" she said. ""They demanded different documents, asked collective questions and kept looking at my daughter expecting her to answer but she doesn't talk as she's only a year and a half old."" The Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn whose daughter was given her husband's surname, has backed a petition to include both parent's names on children's passports. She's also written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd who has rejected the idea. Ms Siddiq said: ""If we had a simple change of two names on the passport stating who the mother and father is then we could go through immigration and we wouldn't face these problems."" ""They could spend the extra time stopping criminals."" It's estimated that hundreds of thousands of travellers, mothers in particular, have had problems with passports in the last five years. That number is likely to be on the rise as social attitudes change. A YouGov poll in 2016 found only 59% of women would take their husband's name. That's compared with a similar poll by Eurobarometer into British attitudes in 1994 which said the figure was 94%. Mother of three, Catherine Eden said she was stopped on the way back from a trip to America with her youngest son. She had to convince the border guard that he was hers and is backing the call for passport reform. ""It made me feel a little bit uneasy to have those questions asked about my son,"" she said. ""I knew I wasn't doing anything wrong but it does make you feel as if you might be doing something wrong."" In a statement the Home Office said it had ""no plans to introduce parental details in the observation page of a child's passport"". ""A passport is a travel document, and its fundamental purpose would change if it were to identify a parental relationship,"" it added. ""We have a duty to safeguard children and to prevent people trafficking, child sexual exploitation and other crimes committed against children. ""That is why Border Force staff need to be content that the adult travelling with the child has parental responsibility, or parental authority has been given to travel with the child. ""We aim to do this quickly and with as minimal disruption to passengers as possible."" Jane Greenwood, a 49-year-old mum of three from Suffolk, said she was left ""incredibly angry and deeply humiliated"" by a dispute involving her 12-year-old daughter at Stansted earlier this year. She explained: ""They refused to believe I was her mother because we didn't share the same name and in the end my husband had to be called back from the baggage carousel to 'claim' her. ""I felt incredibly angry and deeply humiliated. I will travel with my children's birth certificates in future but feel furious that I should have to do this."" Sam Bowen claims she is stopped at border control every time she re-enters the UK with her six-year-old daughter. Ms Bowen kept her maiden name and has travelled with her daughter regularly since splitting from her ex-husband. She claimed that on the first occasion she was stopped, five years ago, she was asked ""very uncomfortable"" questions by officers, including why her and her daughter had a different skin colour. Her daughter is often left ""quite distressed by the atmosphere of accusation and suspicion"", even though Ms Bowen has always travelled with a copy of her birth certificate since the initial incident. But she said her experience when leaving the UK is completely different. ""I have travelled with my daughter to a number of countries all over the world and have never been asked to prove her identity when leaving the UK,"" she said. ""This means that she could be taken by anyone, anywhere, so how is this upholding the UK border control's explanation of this treatment, ensuring the safeguarding of the child and minimising child trafficking?"" Australian Maree Wallis, 37, of Kingston upon Thames, was held up when travelling between London and Copenhagen with her son, who was 11 weeks old at the time. She faced additional questioning to confirm they were related upon arriving in Denmark and when they left. Her son, now four years old, and her 18-month-old daughter have surnames that combine her surname with her Spanish husband's and so they always travel with their Spanish 'family book', which is the country's official registration of a couple and their children."

2017-11-05,It is hard to think of another Bank of England decision that is simultaneously as momentous and as inconsequential as this one.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171105234721/http://news.sky.com/story/who-are-the-winners-and-losers-if-the-bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-11108804,"The mere fact that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to raise interest rates this month is a landmark moment all of its own. It would be the first time rates have been lifted in a decade - a watershed after a period in which borrowing costs dropped to the lowest level on record. And for many economists, it is only the start of a long road that might take rates back up towards a more normal level (though this will almost certainly be lower than the pre-crisis ""normal"" of about 5%). But, on the basis of other measures, an interest rate rise is likely to have little impact. In part that is because, for all the headlines recently about levels of indebtedness, Britons' overall household debt levels have actually dropped a fair bit in recent years. A decade ago in the summer of 2007, the last time the Bank raised rates, the average UK household had Â£1.44 of debt for every pound of savings they had in the bank. Today, that ratio has dropped to Â£1.13 of debt for every pound of savings. Yes, that number has started to rise recently thanks to an increase in consumer credit lending, but only very slightly - and it is a long way shy of its pre-crisis peak. :: Interest rate rise looms next month after lift in economic growth Then there's the question of how many people will feel an instant impact of the Bank's decision - the ""transmission mechanism"", to use the economic terminology. Here, too, things have changed. Five years ago, 73% of the population had floating rate mortgages - in other words, loans where rates would instantly go up by 0.25% or near enough as soon as the Bank did likewise. Today, only 43% of mortgage holders have floating rate loans - the lowest proportion in history. That's the total stock of loans across the UK, many of which will be smaller loans. The reality for recent homebuyers (the ones with the bigger loans) is even more stark in the most recent quarter. A whopping 94% of mortgages were issued with fixed rates - the highest proportion in history. Long story short: fewer people than ever before will be affected on day one. None of this is to say that higher interest rates won't take their toll. It just underlines that the impact will be gradual and subtle, rather than immediate. But as anyone who has experienced debt problems before will know, that is precisely the way individual debt problems mount. :: Interest rate rise should not be feared, says Bank of England economist You face a short-term problem - say your rent going up, your job being lost or hours being cut, and you borrow a little bit to tide you over. Then things get worse, not better. Your debt costs rack up further and you find yourself mired in debt you can no longer see an escape from. It is a lonely, miserable experience, and something many families in the country struggle with. And that is the important point about rising interest rates. The Bank is not worried about a nationwide debt crisis, or an abrupt implosion of demand as it increases the cost of borrowing. However, it is concerned about small pockets of trouble across the country. In particular, low income households are likely to be most exposed - families who have had to borrow to absorb the cost of rising food and fuel prices, who have seen their real wages slide, and are now facing extra pressure from the benefits squeeze. It is they who will be most affected by rising rates. Again, this may not happen overnight: indeed, of all the interest rates out there in the market, those on credit cards and payday loans are perhaps least affected by Bank rate itself. But any increase in the cost of borrowing is unlikely to help. Finally, what about savers? Well, this is where things get interesting. On the one hand, savers have had a torrid time over the past few years - especially those expecting to live off the interest on their savings. On the other hand, the vast majority of other asset prices have gone up dramatically in that period: share prices, house prices (although mostly house prices in London), bond prices. Moreover, savers have benefited from an unusual phenomenon in recent years. Most of the time, the interest rates you're paid on your savings is below the official Bank rate. For instance, between 1999 and 2008, the average rate on an instant access savings account was 2.2 percentage points below the official Bank rate - and the rate on a long-term savings account was 0.6% below Bank rate. Since the crisis, the average instant access savings account has paid 0.24 percentage points above Bank rate while the average long-term account has paid 1.66 percentage points above the official rate. This is largely down to the fact that Britain's banks have spent this period trying to rebuild their balance sheets by attempting to lure in new customer deposits. In other words, while it hasn't been a great time to be a saver, it hasn't been quite as bad as the official Bank rate suggests. Which raises another question: if and when the official rate starts going up, do the savings rates themselves also increase, or do they stay where they are?"
2017-11-05,First Secretary of State Damian Green has strongly denied claims by a former police chief that pornographic material was found on one of his parliamentary computers. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171105234721/http://news.sky.com/story/senior-pm-ally-damian-green-denies-computer-porn-claims-11114522,"The Sunday Times reported that former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick alleged the material was found by officers investigating government leaks in 2008. Mr Quick, who was in charge of the leaks inquiry, claimed officers at the time reported finding ""extreme porn"" on a computer in Mr Green's House of Commons office. The alleged discovery was reportedly included in a statement prepared by Mr Quick for the Leveson inquiry into press ethics. Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed on Sunday morning that the ongoing Cabinet Office inquiry into Mr Green's conduct has been widened to look at the allegations. Mr Green - effectively Prime Minister Theresa May's deputy - issued a firm denial on Twitter on Saturday night. The Ashford MP said: ""This story is completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source. ""I've been aware for some years that the discredited former assistant commissioner Bob Quick has tried to cause me political damage by leaking false information about the raid on my parliamentary office. :: Tory ex-ministers investigated over claims ""No newspaper has printed this story due to the complete lack of any evidence. ""It is well known that Quick, who was forced to apologise for alleging that the Conservative Party was trying to undermine him, harbours deep resentment about his press treatment during the time of my investigation. :: Fallon accused of lunging at junior reporter ""More importantly, the police have never suggested to me that improper material was found on my parliamentary computer, nor did I have a 'private' computer, as has been claimed. ""The allegations about the material and computer, now nine years old, are false, disreputable political smears from a discredited police officer acting in flagrant breach of his duty to keep the details of police investigations confidential, and amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination."" Police controversially searched Mr Green's Commons office in November 2008 following a spate of leaks of Home Office information while Gordon Brown was prime minister. According to the Sunday Times, current Met Commissioner Cressida Dick was one of the senior officers who worked with Mr Quick on the inquiry. Mr Quick resigned from the force in 2009 after he was pictured entering Downing Street holding sensitive anti-terror documents, which were partially visible.

Mr Quick is due to give evidence to the Whitehall inquiry launched into Mr Green's behaviour after a journalist claimed he behaved inappropriately towards her. Kate Maltby, who is three decades younger than the First Secretary of State, told The Times that Mr Green ""fleetingly"" touched her knee during a meeting in a Waterloo pub in 2015, and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. Mr Green said any allegation that he made sexual advances to Ms Maltby was ""untrue (and) deeply hurtful""."

Martin was wanted for allegedly leading a fuel theft ring that illegally taps into pipelines to steal petrol and diesel. The practice is a risky but lucrative business that has become Mexico's second-biggest organised crime problem after drug trafficking. Prosecutors said in a statement: ""He was trying to change his identity with a series of plastic surgery procedures to alter his face and remove his fingerprints so he could not be identified. ""The medical personnel involved are also being investigated."" A total of 12 people were killed in Puebla on Monday in what investigators say was a settling of scores between rival members of Martin's gang. Five were murdered in the village of Tlaltenango on a farm where authorities found tubes, valves and pumps for illegal pipeline taps, as well as three stolen vehicles. Three other victims appear to have been bystanders caught in the crossfire, investigators said. Prosecutors said the hits appeared to have been ordered by another crime boss known as ""El Irving"" who had the same rank as Martin within the gang. Puebla is the epicentre of the booming fuel theft racket, which state oil company Pemex estimates has cost it Â£1.8bn ($2.4bn) since 2010."

The cladding is suspected to have helped the blaze spread through the tower in June, killing an estimate 80 people. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service were called to Arconic's plant in Exeter on Saturday, after reports of a fire in the casting plant at its foundry section. Eight fire engines were sent to tackle the accidental blaze which spread to the roof of the factory before being extinguished. ""Due to the potential serious nature of this incident and knowledge of the type of building involved, fire control made the decision to redirect fire appliances from other lower priority incidents in the area to ensure fire service resources were in attendance as soon as possible,"" a statement from fire service said. The factory's furnace area was damaged by the fire and smoke, but no-one was injured. The DevonLive website says the Exeter plant casts precision parts for the aerospace industry. In June, Arconic announced it was stopping global sales of Reynobond PE cladding for tall buildings, citing concerns about the ""inconsistency of building codes across the world"". Following the Grenfell disaster, the UK government carried out cladding tests on hundreds of high-rise blocks, which led to some of them being removed and replaced."

They have analysed around 13.4 million files said to have been leaked, about 18 months after the disclosure of the Panama Papers sent shockwaves through the world of business. The leaked documents suggest Lord Ashcroft, who has donated millions to the Tories, had a previously unknown offshore trust which at one point was worth over Â£300m. :: Paradise Papers: Queen's private estate invests in offshore tax havens Reports based on the Paradise Papers by the BBC claim the former Conservative Party Treasurer retained non-domiciled tax status in Belize at a time when it was generally thought he had given up the status. Mr McDonnell has said the Prime Minister should be prepared to answer questions given her party's pledge to bring transparency to the offshore industry. ""If the identification of Lord Ashcroft, a major Tory party funder, on the list and if the allegations of tax avoidance are true, it means that the Prime Minister has questions to answer,"" the Shadow Chancellor said. ""What did she and the Conservative Party know about Ashcroft's tax affairs and what due diligence checks were applied before she agreed to the Conservative Party accepting significant donations from him?"" Mr McDonnell added. Lord Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, told The Guardian the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures, and that ""any suggestion or implication that he has will be vigorously challenged"". The Panama Papers resulted in lasting damage for a number of the figures named, including Iceland's Prime Minister, who stepped down after suggestions he held investments in Iceland's collapsed banks, and former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable called for MPs to investigate the claims about the so-called Paradise Papers. :: Offshore Accounts Of World Leaders Revealed ""The Paradise Papers suggest that a small number of wealthy individuals have been able, entirely legally, to put their money beyond the reach of the Exchequer,"" said Mr Cable. ""Given these revelations, including news that Conservative donors benefited from these arrangements, we need a parliamentary select committee to investigate fully who decided what and why,"" he added. ""In particular, we need the release of all government papers dealing with the decision not to clamp down on offshore tax havens. Only in this way can we ensure there is full public confidence in the tax system,"" said the Lib Dem leader. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn added on Twitter that the disclosure ""proves"" that ""there's one rule for the super-rich and another for the rest when it comes to paying tax."" Responding to the latest revelations, a government spokeswoman said: ""Since 2010, the Government has secured an additional Â£160 billion, more than the annual UK NHS budget, for our vital public services by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance. ""This includes more than Â£2.8 billion from those trying to hide money abroad to avoid paying what they owe. There are 26,000 HMRC staff tackling tax avoidance and evasion, and we have provided an extra Â£800 million to fund their efforts"" ""A fair tax system is a critical and key part of our plan to build a fairer society, and we are clear that everyone must pay what is due, at the right time."""

A 14-year-old boy arrested on Friday has now been released under investigation. Police said the victim of the first attack, a pizza delivery moped driver, was critically injured after being sprayed in the face with a corrosive substance and may lose his sight. The 32-year-old was attacked in Walpole Road, Walthamstow, at about 6pm last Thursday, after being approached by two men on a moped who attempted to steal his vehicle. He suffered severe injuries to his eyes and face, and also breathed in the noxious substance. The suspects then fled on their moped as a member of the public went to the victim's aid, pouring water on his wounds. The man remains in hospital in a critical condition. Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Henderson, of Waltham Forest CID, said: ""This attack has left a man fighting for his life and with terrible eye injuries. ""This was an innocent man going about his work as a delivery driver, who may never see again."" Appealing for information, he said: ""Your phone call could save some other innocent person; it is imperative that we arrest those responsible."" Detectives are also investigating a second attack which took place half an hour later in Tottenham. The second victim - also a 32-year-old delivery driver - was sprayed with a corrosive substance as two men on a scooter attempted to steal his moped. He was treated in hospital for his injuries, but they are not believed to be life-threatening or life-changing. Detectives are investigating whether the two attacks are linked."
2017-11-05,"As the allegations keep coming thick and fast, the atmosphere in Westminster is febrile.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171105234721/http://news.sky.com/story/sex-pest-scandal-engulfing-westminster-worse-than-expenses-11112503,"I've heard senior figures in both major parties warning darkly that this is worse than the expenses scandal which rocked British politics in 2009. It certainly has many similar elements - a oversight regime which was revealed to be not fit for purpose, a drip-drip of allegations turning into a flood, and the risk that all MPs will be tarred as sex pests due to the behaviour of a small number. :: Fallon quit after No 10 told of sex assault claim The veteran Conservative MP Gary Streeter hit an unwelcome nerve for many in his party when he warned on Twitter that this felt like the John Major years - ""no majority, no money, ripping ourselves apart over the EU. That lasted five years. Oh dear"". Twenty years later, there are fears in the party that yet again the Conservatives could again be riven apart on Europe and then destroyed by sleaze. It's hard to believe that this barely began a week ago, when it was reported in a newspaper that a Whatsapp group of female Parliamentary staff were sharing experiences about inappropriate behaviour. Within days the scandal had reached Theresa May's government with the trade minister Mark Garnier the first to be accused and defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday, the first scalp to be claimed. :: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline Few in the Conservative party now think his resignation will be the last, in a scandal which threatens to derail not just the reputation of politics, but the delicate Cabinet balance Mrs May relies on to keep her fragile administration together. That her key ally, the de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green is under investigation over claims by the writer Kate Maltby that he touched her knee and wrote her an inappropriate text message, will be a source of worry to No 10. Developments in the Labour party are if anything even more serious, with the allegation by activist Bex Bailey that she was raped by a senior party figure and advised against reporting it by party officials. NEC member Jasmin Beckett has told Sky News that more victims were waiting in the wings, and called on her party to help them come forward. Allegations have already resulted in the suspension of Corbyn ally Kelvin Hopkins, 76, over claims - stringently denied - that he inappropriately touched an activist 50 years his junior; and an investigation into Clive Lewis, who denies he groped a woman at the party's conference. Both men served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. In fact Mr Hopkins was promoted to shadow culture secretary last summer, months after the leader's office was made aware that he had been reprimanded for sending the activist a suggestive text message. The senior Labour MPs, as well as Mr Green, are adamant that the allegations are untrue, and Mr Lewis even accused his accuser of lying. There is deep anger in Westminster at the way these allegations are coming out because, at least in part as a result of the failure of the political parties' processes, victims are instead going public before due process can take place. A list of around 40 Conservative MPs compiled by party staff, and circulating on social media, has been blamed for muddying the waters between MPs having affairs or relationships with colleagues; along with unsubstantiated accusations of harassment. Some MPs on the list have already come out to denounce the claims as lies, such as the Penrith MP Rory Stewart, whose researcher has backed him up. But as both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn scramble to get a grip on the scandal, events are moving fast. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party on Friday night and serious allegations referred to the police, responded angrily that the media were told about his suspension before he was and that he was not aware of the claim. The Prime Minister has issued a new code of conduct and allegations hotline for all representatives of her party, and the Labour leader said an independent specialist organisation would be appointed to handle complaints in the future. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the ""dam has broken"" in Westminster, according to Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said it was time for the ""male-dominated professionsâ¦where the boys' own locker room culture has prevailed"" to clean up. Westminster is not a normal work environment. MPs hire their own staff - often plucked from thousands who want to work at the heart of politics - and those staff can expect a different work culture depending on whether their boss is a 30-year-old, who has come from a career in business, or a 70-year-old, who has been in politics for decades. Drinking and socialising in Parliament's bars, but also away on by-elections and party conferences, can be part and parcel. Few MPs doubt that this is a watershed moment for the behaviour of parliamentarians and how Westminster is scrutinised. It is hoped that higher standards of conduct will eventually result. But as with expenses, things could get a lot worse before they get better."
2017-11-05,A British woman detained after flying into Egypt with painkillers for her husband's bad back has been told she could face the death penalty for drug trafficking.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171105234721/http://news.sky.com/story/hull-woman-held-in-egypt-for-taking-painkillers-into-country-11112444,"Laura Plummer was arrested on 9 October after the authorities found she was carrying prescription drugs tramadol and naproxen in her suitcase. The 33-year-old from Hull is said to have been taking 29 strips of the medication to her Egyptian husband Omar, also 33, who has suffered from back pain since an accident. Laura and Omar met four years ago and she flies to Egypt four times a year to visit him. On this occasion, they had planned to enjoy a two-week holiday at a beach resort when Laura was arrested. Laura's mother Roberta, 63, and Laura's sisters, Rachel, 31, and Jayne, 40, have all visited Laura, who is due back in court on Thursday. Laura's mother told The Sun: ""We've been told she's facing either 25 years in prison or the death penalty. We're beside ourselves worrying that they'll make an example of her."" Her sister, Rachel, says Laura is accused of drug trafficking. She told Sky News: ""It's tramadol, to me that's only a painkiller I've taken for a migraine before, to the Egyptians it's equivalent to heroin. It's unbelievable. ""But a drug trafficker to me is a million-pound hidden smuggle, not this. She didn't hide them... they were for no profit as they are worth Â£23."" She says Laura took the painkillers to Egypt for private use, and not to make any money. ""She also had ibuprofen,"" says Rachel. Tramadol is only sold on prescription in the UK and is used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is understood Laura's charges relate to the possession of the tramadol, which is illegal in Egypt, and not the naproxen, which her sister says is not illegal. Naproxen is also a prescription drug that is used to treat inflammation in joints and muscles. ""She is the last person to deserve this, she is guilty of her own stupidity, not for drug trafficking,"" says Rachel. ""The treatment she's receiving in Hurghada prison is beyond disgusting, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."" The Foreign Office has confirmed it is supporting a British woman and her family following her detention in Egypt."

The Houthis have a stockpile of what they call Burkan or Volcano missiles, their homegrown variant of the Scud. It is less likely, but possible, that the missile was supplied by their Iranian backers. This is a serious provocation and what matters next is how the Saudis choose to respond. Yemen has been gripped by a nasty civil war for two and a half years. Houthi rebels are backed by Iran; their rivals are supported by the Saudis and other Gulf Arab militaries. The Saudis have led a devastating air campaign that has killed thousands and wounded tens of thousands of people, wrecked much of the civilian infrastructure of the country and failed to defeat the Houthis' uprising. The British supply some of the weaponry being used by the Saudis and provide advisers in their command and control centre through the UK. A humanitarian disaster has unfolded in what was already a desperately poor country, including outbreaks of cholera and starvation. The conflict desperately needs fresh thinking, international mediation and progress towards a negotiated settlement. The last thing it needs is escalation in the form of a missile aimed at Riyadh airport and the Saudi retribution that is likely to follow."

Four forces - Cleveland, Durham, North Yorkshire and Northamptonshire - have no fixed speed cameras in use at all. Staffordshire Police have 272 fixed cameras but just 14 of them are active, while the Derbyshire force operate 112 cameras with just 10 of them switched on. West Yorkshire, Kent, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Cheshire have a quarter or less active. City of London, the Metropolitan Police/Transport for London, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Suffolk and Northern Ireland said all their fixed cameras are in operation. West Midlands Police, who announced in 2013 that their old speed cameras were being switched off, said they now had eight new average speed cameras. The figures cover all police fixed speed cameras, but not the mobile devices forces also use. All the forces that responded said they deployed regular mobile speed cameras across their areas. They also said they regularly review which fixed cameras are turned on. Road safety charity Brake described the figures as concerning and called for all cameras to be switched on. Its director of campaigns, Jason Wakeford, said: ""A staggering 1,800 people lost their lives on British roads last year and speeding is a factor in thousands of crashes. ""Speed cameras are a proven, cost-effective way of reducing deadly collisions and so it's critical they are operational."" AA president Edmund King put the high number of inactive cameras down to pressure on budgets and warned drivers against taking a gamble. ""Drivers who play Russian roulette with fixed-site speed cameras are playing a dangerous game. Our advice is stick to the limits rather than gambling on the yellow boxes,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said the decision to use cameras was ""an operational matter"", adding that ""all forces have individual responsibility for their use of speed cameras""."

Temperatures could dip as low as low single figures on Sunday evening, while in Scotland it could go as low as -5C (23F). In addition to the nippy weather, fog may also be a problem in some areas by Sunday night, made worse by the previous night's displays. Joanna Robinson explains: ""Smoke particles from bonfires and fireworks are hygroscopic, which means they attract water from the atmosphere, therefore encouraging fog to form at lower humidity levels than in clean air.""

Sir Michael's decision to stand down was cast in new light on Sunday as Jane Merrick accused him of lunging at her and trying to kiss her on the lips when she was a junior reporter. She alleged the incident took place following a lunch when she worked for the Daily Mail in 2003. Speaking on Sky News' Sunday with Niall Paterson, Ms Rudd said the incident was ""completely disgusting, absolutely wrong and it is right that he has stepped down"". She added: ""He's made his statement about what he believes was the right thing to do.

The deadly attack took place at the house owned by Lilley in a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, where both women lived. During their trial, the court heard that Lilley, from Stamford in Lincolnshire, was fixated with murdering somebody before she was 25 and had written a book about a fictional serial killer. Pictures released by the court showed the weapons found in the house by police, including a knife set and a bone saw. They also showed the interior of the property decorated with posters and dolls from horror movies. CCTV from around the time of the murder shows Lenon carrying what appears to be a large knife around the house. Investigators also discovered a piece of rectangular carpet had been cut away in the property's lounge, which Lenon used as a bedroom. Prosecutors argued this had been where Mr Pajich was garroted and stabbed. The two women reportedly lured their victim to the house to download software before killing him. The 18-year-old's body was discovered buried under some red tiles in the backyard. A concealed room was also discovered in the house by police, which had walls lined with tarpaulins. A cut-down trolley was discovered in the room which police say was used to move the victim's body. The day before he was attacked the two women were recorded on CCTV buying hydrochloric acid at a hardware store. During the trial, the court heard that Lilley had wanted to tick murder off her ""bucket list"" and was so ""euphoric"" when she had done so she boasted about it to a colleague. Lilley had also written a book about a fictional serial killer called SOS and called herself the same name. Lenon, meanwhile, called herself Corvina, a name she used as part of Perth's bondage scene. Speaking after the trial Keith Sweetman, Aaron Pajich's father said: ""I'm just very glad that we've enabled our community to be free of two evil people."" The two women have fallen out since the murder and blamed each other for Mr Pajich's death during the trial. They will be sentenced in February."

In court, magistrates made an order banning the reporting of any detail likely to lead to the identification of the victim. A post-mortem examination into the girl's death is due to take place later.

2017-11-05,"The Queen's private estate has been accused of investing millions of pounds in offshore tax havens, it has been revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171105234721/http://news.sky.com/story/queens-private-estate-invests-in-offshore-tax-havens-11115644,"The investments by the Duchy of Lancaster emerged after the leak of a massive cache of documents being dubbed the Paradise Papers. The documents have been obtained and analysed by a range of worldwide media organisations including the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Suddeutsche Zeitung, The Guardian and the BBC. There is nothing to suggest that any of the investments are illegal. Suddeutsche Zeitung, a German newspaper, alleged that in 2005, the Duchy of Lancaster invested $7.5m (Â£5.7m) in Dover Street VI Cayman Fund. The Cayman Islands charges no direct tax on the earnings made by companies operating in the British Overseas Territory. While the Queen pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy of Lancaster, any funds the Duchy owns that are listed in tax free havens may be able escape paying tax, thereby boosting their income. Suddeutsche Zeitung also alleged that Dover Street further invested in a subsidiary company called Vision Capital Partners VI B LP to buy into two UK retail chains, one of which was BrightHouse. Brighthouse is the UK's largest rent-to-own firm and has been accused by a Parliamentary committee of charging inflated prices to some of the poorest people in the country. In December 2014, the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Debt and Personal Finance found that a Hotpoint tumble dryer on sale for Â£229 at Curry's would cost BrightHouse customers Â£780 once interest, compulsory insurance and service cover was taken into account. In February 2015, chair of the APPG Yvonne Fovargue MP, releasing a report into rent-to-own firms, said: ""Rent to Own Stores like BrightHouse charge inflated prices to some of the poorest people in the country. Customers are often obliged to take out additional warranties and insurance, as a result paying several times the true value of the goods."" The chief executive of BrightHouse said at the time he was disappointed with the report's findings, and claimed his company provided high quality and competitively priced products. Just last week, it emerged BrightHouse had agreed to reimburse customers to the value of nearly Â£15m after agreeing a compensation package with the Financial Conduct Authority, following a two year investigation. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Dover Street investment was bought in 2005 and forms only 0.3% of the total value of the Duchy. ""The Duchy's investment in BrightHouse is through a third party and equates to Â£3,208 - just 0.0006% of the Duchy's value. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" Anti-monarchy groups said the revelations showed the Queen must be open and transparent about her investments and the tax she pays on them. Graham Smith, the CEO of Republic, said: ""The Queen's personal wealth and investments mean she has a direct interest in government decisions about tax. Yet we have no way of knowing if undue influence has been used by the royal household to protect these investments."" ""The Queen now needs to come clean, to set the highest standards of transparency and probity in her financial affairs."" More follows..."

Saudi Arabia's Al Ekhbariya TV reported it was brought down north of King Khaled Airport and Saudi Arabia's Civil Aviation Authority confirmed on Twitter that it had been brought down over the airport. The authority said in two tweets: ""The Saudi air defence managed to intercept a ballistic missile towards Riyadh. ""The rocket landed on the airport campus and did not cause any significant damage."" :: Riyadh missile: The last thing Yemen's war needs Saudi military officials blamed the Houthi rebel forces in Yemen, Al Arabiya reported, adding that it proved the ""involvement of one of the countries of the region sponsoring terrorism"". Government forces spokesman Turki al Maliki was reported to have told the TV channel the missile was brought down by a US-made Patriot anti-missile rocket, resulting in ""shrapnel"" being scattered over an uninhabited area. He called it an ""explicit challenge to violate the UN resolution (2216) in order to threaten the security of Saudi Arabia and... regional and international security, towards populated cities and villages... contrary to international humanitarian law"". Sky's Diplomatic Editor Dominic Waghorn said: ""What we have in terms of reported facts are a loud explosion, or a number of them over the King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. ""We have reports - eyewitnesses on the ground and video that hasn't been verified yet - of outgoing fire, which might well be air defence missile fire coming out of the airport. ""And then we have a claim from Houthi rebels in Yemen that they fired a long-range missile at Riyadh and the Saudi air defence forces saying it has intercepted a long distance missile that it believes was fired from Yemen. ""This is a very significant development. Yemen is 500 or 600 miles south of Riyadh. For the Houthi rebels to have fired a missile that far and that accurately, is a bit of a game changer."" For two and a half years Saudi Arabia has led a coalition fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Saudis, who back Yemen's internationally recognised government, accuse the Houthis of starting the war. The Houthi rebels have seized control of Yemen's capital Sanaa, which has forced the government into exile. Despite thousands of airstrikes and a blockade of Yemen from the sea and air, the Saudi-led coalition has failed to push the Houthis out, although it does claim to have reduced the territory the rebels control. Some, including the authors of a UN report, have accused the Saudis of causing devastation and the deaths of thousands, as a result of their involvement in the war."
2017-11-05,"The UK was ""misled"" over Saddam Hussein's access to weapons of mass destruction, and the Iraq War was unjustified, Gordon Brown has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171105234721/http://news.sky.com/story/gordon-brown-uk-was-misled-over-iraq-wmds-11114352,"The former prime minister, who was chancellor when the decision to go to war in 2003 was made, said the US failed to share crucial intelligence that cast serious doubt over the dictator's destructive capabilities. He believes the course of history could have been different had the information been shared. ""When I consider the rush to war in March, 2003 - especially in light of what we now know about the absence of weapons of mass destruction - I ask myself over and over whether I could have made more of a difference before that fateful decision was taken,"" he writes in his latest book My Life, Our Times. ""We now know from classified American documents, that in the first days of September 2002 a report prepared by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff's director for intelligence landed on the desk of the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. ""Commissioned by Rumsfeld to identify gaps in the US intelligence picture, it is now clear how forcibly this report challenged the official view. ""If I am right that somewhere within the American system the truth about Iraq's lack of weapons was known, then we were not just misinformed but misled on the critical issue of WMDs. ""Given that Iraq had no usable chemical, biological or nuclear weapons that it could deploy and was not about to attack the coalition, then two tests of a just war were not met: war could not be justified as a last resort and invasion cannot now be seen as a proportionate response."" The UK was part of the US-led coalition which invaded Iraq after US president George W Bush and the then-prime minister Tony Blair accused Saddam of possessing WMDs. After an inquiry lasting seven years, the Chilcot Report found the former Iraqi dictator posed ""no imminent threat"" at the time of the invasion of his country in 2003, and the war was unleashed on the basis of ""flawed"" intelligence. Mr Brown claims the report suggested previous assessments relied ""heavily on analytic assumptions"" rather than hard evidence and even refuted the country's capability to create weapons of mass destruction. He said: ""It is astonishing that none of us in the British government ever saw this American report."""

At around 6pm on Thursday, the fast food delivery driver was approached by two men on a scooter in Walpole Road. The men attempted to steal the victim's moped and police believe a corrosive substance was then repeatedly thrown into the his face. The victim, a 32-year-old man, was treated at the scene and taken to an east London hospital. Detective chief inspector Gordon Henderson said: ""This attack has left a man fighting for his life and with terrible eye injuries. ""This was an innocent man going about his work as a delivery driver, who may never see again. ""This is not a time to hesitate - if you have any information about this crime I would appeal that you immediately call police."" Police are also investigating an identical acid attack which occurred around half an hour later, in Yarmouth Crescent in Tottenham, north London. The second victim, also a 32-year-old delivery driver, was approached by two men on a scooter who attempted to steal his moped and sprayed a corrosive substance on his face. The victim was taken to hospital but his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or life-changing. It is not yet known if the two attacks are linked, but it is an active line of inquiry and detectives in Tottenham and Waltham Forest are working together."

It was Kate's father who found her body. He started searching for his daughter after growing increasingly concerned when she failed to return home. Kate was stabbed in the neck, but her killer has never been found. The investigation is one of the country's longest running cold cases. Detectives at Devon and Cornwall police are appealing for the public's help. They say the kitchen knife used to kill Kate was around six inches long and they're hoping to trace a man seen at the crime scene in a blue hatchback car at around the time Kate was murdered. The police also have a new lead, which they hope will trigger people's memories. Senior Investigating Officer Paul Burgan told Sky News: ""We located in excess of 100 fibres on Kate's body that are completely alien to her and her home. So we deduced that they were deposited by the offender. The type of material is a bright orange polyester mix, primarily used in work-related garments like boiler suits, work gloves and aprons."" Due to the similarities, Kate's murder has been investigated alongside that of 41-year-old Lyn Bryant, who was killed in 1998. She too was murdered in a remote area, by a knifeman, whilst walking her dog. Around Â£1m has been spent by Devon and Cornwall Police in a bid to try to trace Kate's killer, making it the force's biggest ever murder investigation. At the police headquarters, there are so many documents and files relating to the case that they occupy an entire room. Speaking on the 20th anniversary since his sister's death, Tim Bushell said: ""It's really difficult to comprehend how someone could do that to a 14-year-old girlâ¦You get your anniversaries that come up and the life events, when my children were born, she wasn't there to celebrate them. All your life events you miss them and you should have had your sister around to celebrate withâ¦there have been a lot of missed opportunities as a family together."" Detectives never completely close files on unsolved murders and in this case they're hoping that 20 years on, a renewed appeal for information may provide clues that could ultimately lead to Kate's killer."

Greater Manchester Police said officers worked through the night to corroborate the report but ""the evidence available at this time does not suggest that a child has been abducted"". Earlier, the force said it had not received any reports from family members of a missing child. Superintendent Mark Kenny said: ""Reports that relate to abduction are taken very seriously and extensive enquiries were conducted overnight. ""Officers acted quickly to ensure the safety of the public and this included the checks of vehicles at the park. ""I am positive the report made to us was in good faith however, we have not received a report of a missing child that matches the information reported to us. ""We continue to investigate the circumstances so we can be sure of exactly what has happened and I encourage anyone to speak to us about any concerns that they have."" People on social media said there were long delays leaving the park due to the searches. Chloe Keenan, 18, from Leigh, Wigan, told the Daily Express it took her two hours to get out. She said: ""We were one of the first ones back to the car and we didn't move for an hour. Police were walking down the road."" She added: ""Police told us that the information was scattered, but that a little girl might have been bundled into a car and they had to search our cars.

""There was some gunfire exchanged, I believe, on the roadway also, and then (the shooter's vehicle) wrecked out,"" he said. ""At this time we believe that he had a self-inflicted gunshot wound."" Kelley attacked worshippers during Sunday service at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. Sheriff Tackitt told CNN that Kelley's in-laws went to the church ""from time to time"" but were not there during the attack. The 26-year-old wore black tactical gear and a ballistic vest as he opened fire with an automatic assault rifle in the small town of around 400 people. President Trump described the shooting as an ""act of evil"". ""Our hearts are broken but in dark times, and these are dark times, such as these, Americans do what they do best,"" said the President. The victims range from age five to 72 and include Annabelle Pomeroy, the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor. Crystal Holcombe was killed alongside three of her children and her in-laws, her cousin Nick Uhlig told the Houston Chronicle and Associated Press. Twenty others were injured, including a six-year-old boy named Rylan who was in surgery after being shot four times, his uncle told CBS. Martha Rendon, an official at the University Health System hospital in San Antonio, said five of those injured, including three children, remained in hospital in a serious or critical condition. The patients are aged between four and 57. Sheriff Tackitt said there was probably ""no way"" for people to escape once Kelley opened fire. ""He just walked down the centre aisle, turned around and my understanding was shooting on his way back out,"" he said. ""It's unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenceless people."" As Kelley finished the massacre and tried to escape in his car, a neighbour opened fire and gave chase with another man. ""His vehicle was parked, door open, engine running... him and the neighbour across the street (were) exchanging fire,"" said Johnnie Langendorff. ""We hit about 95(mph) going down 539 trying to catch this guy until he eventually lost control on his own and went off in a ditch. ""The gentleman with me got out, rested his rifle on my hood and aimed at him, telling him to 'get out, get out'. ""There was no movement, the guy didn't put up a fight or anything."" Kelley was found dead with several weapons in his vehicle. The shooting came about a month after gunman Stephen Paddock killed 58 people in Las Vegas - the worst shooting in modern US history. :: The macabre choreography of US mass shootings:: Sky Views: Protecting gun rights as victims go broke Mr Trump said the Texas mass murder was not a ""guns situation"" but a ""mental health problem at the highest level"". The President added: ""Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction otherwise it (wouldn't) have been as bad as it was. It would have been much worse."" ""We are dealing with the largest mass shooting in our state's history,"" said Texas Governor Greg Abbott. He added: ""There's so many families who have lost family members. Fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters."" The politician also told ABC's Good Morning America he did not think the incident was ""just a random act of violence"". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has sent his condolences to Mr Trump over the shooting, according to the Kremlin. Kelley lived in New Braunfels, Texas, near San Antonio, but officials said he did not appear to be linked to any terror groups. Domestic terrorism is defined by the FBI as an attack by a person or group that ""espouse extremist ideologies of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature"". The US Air Force said he had served in the Logistics Readiness until being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct after being court martialed on charges of assaulting his wife and their child. The manager of a vacation resort has confirmed the attacker worked as a security guard. Claudia Varjabedian, the manager at the Summit Vacation Resort, said Kelley had been working at the resort for the past month and a half. She said he ""seemed like a nice guy"" and was unarmed during his daytime shifts. A LinkedIn profile that appears to belong to the killer states that he taught bible studies to children at a Baptist church in Kingsville, Texas, for six months in 2013. Investigators are examining posts he may have made on social media in the days before the shooting, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon. Kelley's Facebook page has been deleted, but cached photos include one of what appeared to be an assault rifle with the caption: ""she's a bad b****""."

In a speech to the CBI, Mrs May promised to create a climate in which ""everyone can feel confident that they are working in a safe and secure environment, where complaints can be brought forward without prejudice and victims know that those complaints will be investigated properly"". ""And where people's careers cannot be damaged by unfounded rumours circulated anonymously online,"" she said. First Secretary of State Damian Green will also be in the spotlight on Monday - as he is interviewed as part of a Cabinet Office investigation which has been expanded to examine claims pornography was discovered on one of his parliamentary computers in 2008. The PM's top ally has strongly denied the claims. The investigation into Mr Green was sparked when journalist Kate Maltby claimed he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee during a meeting at a pub in 2015 and then sent her a ""suggestive"" text a year later after she was featured in a newspaper wearing a corset. Mr Green has labelled allegations he made sexual advances to Ms Maltby ""untrue [and] deeply hurtful"". The inquiry into him was was widened after The Sunday Times reported that former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick alleged that ""extreme porn"" was found by officers investigating government leaks in 2008. Mr Green said the story was ""completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source"". Mr Quick said he did not tell the newspaper about the allegations. Four Conservative MPs were referred to the party's newly established disciplinary committee over allegations made against them at the weekend. One of them - Chris Pincher - has referred himself to the police and stood down from the Whips' Office. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has suggested the scandal could lead to greater powers for MPs to be sacked. She said Westminster was in the midst of a ""watershed moment"" and the end result will be positive after a ""clear out"". The scandal has already seen Sir Michael Fallon resign as defence secretary, with the Sevenoaks MP saying his personal conduct had ""fallen below the high standards we require of the armed forces"". Journalist Jane Merrick has accused Sir Michael of lunging at her and trying to kiss her on the lips when she was a junior reporter in 2003."

The toddler died four days after being taken to the University Hospital of Wales. She had a bleed on the brain, a skull fracture, retinal bleeding in both of her eyes and damaged ribs. A paediatrician said it was likely that Elsie had been ""shaken violently"", with her head being ""rocked backwards and forwards"". The little girl went to live with Scully-Hicks and his husband in September 2015, eight months before she died. In that time she sustained a number of injuries, which the prosecution suggested amounted to ""assault and abuse"". Six months before her death, she suffered bruises to her head. On that occasion, Matthew Scully-Hicks called 999, saying: ""My daughter's fallen down the stairs. She's not responding to me... I didn't push the gate closed properly and she fell down."" When the operator asked if the toddler was responding, he replied: ""Her eyes are opening and they're rolling around. I think she's looking at me now but she's not moving... oh my god, she's being sick."" Prosecuting barrister Paul Lewis told Cardiff Crown Court that Elsie's death was ""the tragic culmination of a course of violent conduct on (Scully-Hicks') part towards a defenceless child."" He added that Elsie should have been ""loved and protected"", but was instead ""assaulted, abused and ultimately murdered"" by Scully-Hicks. Neighbours said they had heard Scully-Hicks shouting at Elsie, telling her to ""shut up"". In a series of text messages he referred to her as ""Satan"" and a ""psycho"". In one, he explained to his husband that he was struggling to cope with caring for their adopted daughter. He wrote: ""I'm going through hell with Elsie. Mealtimes and bedtimes are like my worst nightmare at the minute. She has been up there screaming for 10 minutes non-stop"". In another, he said: ""Elsie has had two nights of being Satan before bed which ain't fun... she pretty much looks like the exorcist to be fair."" Matthew Scully-Hicks' husband, Craig, told the court the couple's home was filled with nothing but love and affection. He said that had he suspected anything was wrong, he would have intervened."

But it was intercepted by plain-clothed officers working on Operation Airborne, a unit dedicated to reducing the number of drones getting into the prison, and Adifiyi's DNA was found on the device. He had left the scene, but a search of his home uncovered another 476 grams of a psychoactive substance, with a prison value of Â£38,000, the Met Police said. He pleaded guilty to three charges of conveying a prohibited article into prison and one count of possession of psychoactive substances with intent to supply. He was jailed for three years at Blackfriars Crown Court on Monday.

The protagonist walks right by the queue, with the tagline saying ""Upgrade to Galaxy"". :: Apple Rivals Poke Fun at iPhone 6 'Bendgate' The notch is a half-inch intrusion into the iPhone X's ""edge-to-edge"" screen housing the smartphone's sensors. It has drawn criticism from many users and app developers for breaking the typical layout of perfect rectangular displays. The iPhone X was launched last week, with enthusiasts lining up overnight outside Apple stores to get their hands on the latest Apple product. Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri told the Reuters news agency: ""Production is growing every week, and that's very, very important during a ramp period.""

It said the increases represented a 4.6% rise in the capital and 3.6% elsewhere - above the official rate of inflation currently at 3% - with higher inflation, rising housing rents and transport costs all reflected in the rises. The scheme aims to set a pay rate that meets the actual cost of living. Its runs above statutory Minimum Wage and National Living Wage rates - the latter currently standing at Â£7.50 per hour. Any increase will be helpful - especially after the Bank of England raised borrowing costs through an interest rate rise to combat higher inflation last week. Living Wage Foundation director, Katherine Chapman, said: ""The new rates will bring relief for thousands of UK workers being squeezed by stagnant wages and rising inflation. ""It's thanks to the leadership of over 3,600 employers across the UK who are committed to paying all their staff, including cleaners and security staff, a real living wage.

Two police officers, Inspector Mandy Chamberlain and PC John Wills, were due to face a misconduct hearing over allegations evidence had been deleted from mobile phones or removed from the scene without permission. However, the hearing was dropped on Friday after it was ruled it had been too long since proceedings opened for the officers to answer the allegations against them. Liam's parents, Sharla John and Delroy Albert, have now accused the Metropolitan Police of wasting time, and also criticised the decision to allow the officer driving the police car to retire. In a statement, they said their son's death ""and the truth"" were ""always less important than self-preservation"". They said the hearing would have been an opportunity for the Met Police ""to explain their conduct during and after the fatal collision"" and that the force had declined to ""explain what really went wrong"" at ""every step of this process"". Ms John and Mr Albert said they also hold the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) responsible for some of the delays. They said they knew their son ""should never have been in the car"" and that they ""had never sought to suggest otherwise"". ""Although entitled to, we have not sought compensation,"" they said. ""This has simply been an eight-year search for the truth. Last week was supposed to be the culmination of that search. ""The manner in which this complaint was handled leaves us wondering if this was total incompetence or an intended outcome. Now we shall now never know the truth and feel totally let down by the MPS and the IPCC."" The Metropolitan Police repeated its initial comment to Sky News following the couple's statement. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said: ""It would be impossible for the two officers to have a fair hearing given the long history and circumstances of this case. ""Delays to the IPCC investigation were not within the control of the Met."" IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts said the watchdog had apologised to Mr Albert's family and recognised that they felt ""badly let down"". She said: ""While our investigation was completed within two years, we recognise that, at eight years, this process has taken far too long. ""This case has a long and involved procedural history and we very much regret our part in any delay."" Ms Butts added: ""Since this investigation concluded, the IPCC has undergone a substantial change programme and has made significant improvements in the way we work to prevent similar delays occurring."""
2017-11-06,Gaming operator Gala Interactive has agreed a Â£2.3m penalty with regulators after failings which saw two high-spending customers gamble away stolen money online.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171107003212/http://news.sky.com/story/gala-pays-23m-after-stolen-money-gambled-away-11116519,"Gala, which includes bingo and poker brands and is owned by Ladbrokes Coral, has agreed to repay the Â£1.3m stolen funds to the victims - plus Â£1m towards research into problem gambling. The Gambling Commission said its failures were aggravated by the fact that they took place just as the business was giving assurances following a previous, similar case. Ladbrokes Coral said it accepted that the failures saw it fall short of accepted standards and offered to pay a further Â£200,000 towards research in addition to the penalty package. One of the customers at the centre of the case, later jailed for four years for stealing from an employer, lost Â£837,545 over 14 months. The other, who gambled away Â£432,765 over 11 months, was jailed for four-and-a-half years for a money laundering offence. An investigation found there were ""significant flaws"" in Gala's dealings with the two high-spending customers and that it breached regulations that protect consumers. The Gambling Commission said the firms ""failed to effectively interact"" with the customers who were displaying traits of problem gambling, and did not have written policies in place that could have curbed the behaviour. At the same time as the customers were gambling with Gala, the company had been assuring the Commission that customers of concern would be better handled in the wake of a previous case. That case, centring on Gala's relationship with a man who stole from a vulnerable adult, saw it forfeit Â£846,000 to the victim in April 2016. Gambling Commission chief executive Sarah Harrison said: ""It is the responsibility of all operators... to ensure they are protecting their customers and step in when there is behaviour that might indicate problem gambling. ""This did not happen in this case and the Â£2.3m penalty package should serve as a warning to other operators."" Ladbrokes Coral chief executive Jim Mullen said: ""While we will always be exposed to risk of people failing to follow procedures, we accept that, in this case, the failings were evidence of a lack of priority being given to changes in approach identified in earlier engagements. ""The Ladbrokes Coral business has moved on since these cases occurred and the mindset of the Board and the management is that there can be no short cuts on delivering our social responsibility and anti-money laundering obligations."""
2017-11-06,The husband of a British woman being held in an Iranian jail has called for Boris Johnson to provide answers over a blunder that risks lengthening her prison sentence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171107003212/http://news.sky.com/story/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffes-husband-wants-action-over-boris-johnson-gaffe-11116856,"Richard Ratcliffe demanded the Foreign Secretary corrects remarks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, while he even suggested Mr Johnson should visit the mother-of-one in Tehran. Mr Johnson has already been forced to call Iran's foreign minister to ensure his remarks are ""not misrepresented"", the Foreign Office revealed. Meanwhile, Labour shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has written to Mr Johnson to insist he must resign should his actions result in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe spending longer in prison. The 38-year-old has been detained in the Iranian capital since April last year, when she was arrested at Tehran airport as she attempted to return home from a visit to see her family. :: Boris gaffe may double Briton's jail sentence Iran's Revolutionary Guard claim she was plotting to overthrow the regime, an allegation Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe rejects, and she has been denied access to consular assistance. The couple's three-year-old daughter Gabriella has also been forced to stay in the country with her maternal grandparents, while Mr Ratcliffe fights for her freedom in London. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Ratcliffe confirmed his wife is now facing a new charge of spreading propaganda against the regime, which she revealed in a ""tearful"" phone call to him after a court appearance on Saturday. The fresh accusation came just days after Mr Johnson told the House of Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was teaching journalism in Iran. Both Mr Ratcliffe and his wife's employers, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, deny that was the case, insisting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was merely on holiday in Iran, a country where the charity do not conduct their work. He said: ""It's been long a demand that we've been making of the Government to be clear that she's innocent, she's was there on holiday and this is outrageous the way a British citizen has been treated."" But Iran's judiciary have seized on Mr Johnson's comments as justification for holding the British-Iranian national. Mr Ratcliffe revealed his wife could now have her current sentence doubled under Iranian law, as they claim she is now a second-time offender. He accused the Foreign Secretary of ""giving them [Iran] space to be able to smear"" his wife. Although Mr Ratcliffe added he was pleased with Mr Johnson's condemnation of Iran during the committee appearance, in which he also said he would be open to visiting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe. ""We spent a long time asking the Foreign Secretary to engage and he did engage last week,"" Mr Ratcliffe said. ""I want Nazinin home, I want Gabriella home, so actually - if it was top ask - it would be for him to say something to Parliament and to go over there. ""Aside from whatever's been said, actually the signal politically of going there to visit her is no small thing."" The Thomson Reuters Foundation have also demanded Mr Johnson retract his comments, clarifying Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a project manager for the charity and has never trained journalists. Monique Villa, chief executive of the charitable arm of the Thomson Reuters news agency, said: ""I see a direct correlation between this statement by Boris Johnsonâ¦ and the fact that Nazanin was brought once again into court on Saturday 4 November and accused of 'spreading propaganda against the regime'."" She added the latest charge ""can only worsen"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's situation. Responding to the row, a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Last week's remarks by the Foreign Secretary provide no justifiable basis on which to bring any additional charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. ""While criticising the Iranian case against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Foreign Secretary sought to explain that even the most extreme set of unproven Iranian allegations against her were insufficient reason for her detention and treatment. ""The UK will continue to do all it can to secure her release on humanitarian grounds and the Foreign Secretary will be calling the Iranian foreign minister to raise again his serious concerns about the case and ensure his remarks are not misrepresented."""

Speaking after the meeting, Theresa May hailed an ""important step forward"" as she revealed the plans, which include upgrading an existing helpline in order to provide face-to-face support for parliamentary staff by the end of November. ""Sadly, over recent days we've seen a number of allegations about figures from across the political parties,"" she said. ""It's important that those are investigated impartially and some have rightly been referred to the police.

She said: ""The allegations that have come to the fore in the last week, I've been made aware of over that time period because of things that have appeared in the press but also allegations that I've been told over the last week in private."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed the ""proof of the pudding is going to be in the eating"" over the cross-party proposals. Speaking to Sky News in Parliament after the meeting, he said: ""We've agreed to set up this urgent group to represent all staff who work in this building, not just MPs and their staff.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""These are the right first cross-party steps to address harassment and abuse in Westminster.

2017-11-06,It is hard to think of another Bank of England decision that is simultaneously as momentous and as inconsequential as this one.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171107003212/http://news.sky.com/story/who-are-the-winners-and-losers-if-the-bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-11108804,"The mere fact that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to raise interest rates this month is a landmark moment all of its own. It would be the first time rates have been lifted in a decade - a watershed after a period in which borrowing costs dropped to the lowest level on record. And for many economists, it is only the start of a long road that might take rates back up towards a more normal level (though this will almost certainly be lower than the pre-crisis ""normal"" of about 5%). But, on the basis of other measures, an interest rate rise is likely to have little impact. In part that is because, for all the headlines recently about levels of indebtedness, Britons' overall household debt levels have actually dropped a fair bit in recent years. A decade ago in the summer of 2007, the last time the Bank raised rates, the average UK household had Â£1.44 of debt for every pound of savings they had in the bank. Today, that ratio has dropped to Â£1.13 of debt for every pound of savings. Yes, that number has started to rise recently thanks to an increase in consumer credit lending, but only very slightly - and it is a long way shy of its pre-crisis peak. :: Interest rate rise looms next month after lift in economic growth Then there's the question of how many people will feel an instant impact of the Bank's decision - the ""transmission mechanism"", to use the economic terminology. Here, too, things have changed. Five years ago, 73% of the population had floating rate mortgages - in other words, loans where rates would instantly go up by 0.25% or near enough as soon as the Bank did likewise. Today, only 43% of mortgage holders have floating rate loans - the lowest proportion in history. That's the total stock of loans across the UK, many of which will be smaller loans. The reality for recent homebuyers (the ones with the bigger loans) is even more stark in the most recent quarter. A whopping 94% of mortgages were issued with fixed rates - the highest proportion in history. Long story short: fewer people than ever before will be affected on day one. None of this is to say that higher interest rates won't take their toll. It just underlines that the impact will be gradual and subtle, rather than immediate. But as anyone who has experienced debt problems before will know, that is precisely the way individual debt problems mount. :: Interest rate rise should not be feared, says Bank of England economist You face a short-term problem - say your rent going up, your job being lost or hours being cut, and you borrow a little bit to tide you over. Then things get worse, not better. Your debt costs rack up further and you find yourself mired in debt you can no longer see an escape from. It is a lonely, miserable experience, and something many families in the country struggle with. And that is the important point about rising interest rates. The Bank is not worried about a nationwide debt crisis, or an abrupt implosion of demand as it increases the cost of borrowing. However, it is concerned about small pockets of trouble across the country. In particular, low income households are likely to be most exposed - families who have had to borrow to absorb the cost of rising food and fuel prices, who have seen their real wages slide, and are now facing extra pressure from the benefits squeeze. It is they who will be most affected by rising rates. Again, this may not happen overnight: indeed, of all the interest rates out there in the market, those on credit cards and payday loans are perhaps least affected by Bank rate itself. But any increase in the cost of borrowing is unlikely to help. Finally, what about savers? Well, this is where things get interesting. On the one hand, savers have had a torrid time over the past few years - especially those expecting to live off the interest on their savings. On the other hand, the vast majority of other asset prices have gone up dramatically in that period: share prices, house prices (although mostly house prices in London), bond prices. Moreover, savers have benefited from an unusual phenomenon in recent years. Most of the time, the interest rates you're paid on your savings is below the official Bank rate. For instance, between 1999 and 2008, the average rate on an instant access savings account was 2.2 percentage points below the official Bank rate - and the rate on a long-term savings account was 0.6% below Bank rate. Since the crisis, the average instant access savings account has paid 0.24 percentage points above Bank rate while the average long-term account has paid 1.66 percentage points above the official rate. This is largely down to the fact that Britain's banks have spent this period trying to rebuild their balance sheets by attempting to lure in new customer deposits. In other words, while it hasn't been a great time to be a saver, it hasn't been quite as bad as the official Bank rate suggests. Which raises another question: if and when the official rate starts going up, do the savings rates themselves also increase, or do they stay where they are?"

Here is a summary of the main allegations so far against prominent political figures. Conservative :: Damian Green A Whitehall inquiry is looking into claims that Mr Green behaved inappropriately to a journalist and that pornographic material was found on one of his parliamentary computers. Mr Green - effectively PM Theresa May's deputy - has said any allegation that he made sexual advances to a journalist is ""untrue and deeply hurtful"". Kate Maltby, who is three decades younger than the First Secretary of State, told The Times that Mr Green ""fleetingly"" touched her knee during a meeting in a Waterloo pub in 2015, and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message. Mr Green strongly denied a Sunday Times report that former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick would claim pornographic material was found by officers investigating government leaks in 2008. :: Chris Pincher The Government whip has referred himself to police and stepped down from the Whips' Office. The Mail on Sunday reported that Mr Pincher had been accused of making an unwanted pass at a Conservative activist and former British rower Alex Story. Mr Pincher told the newspaper: ""If Mr Story has ever felt offended by anything I said then I can only apologise to him."" :: Daniel Kawczynski Mr Kawczynski, a former special adviser to David Cameron, has been accused of trying to pressure a young researcher to go on a date with a friend of his. The Shrewsbury and Atcham MP is understood to admit he did put forward the idea, but denies any suggestion that anything inappropriate took place. He has been referred to the Conservative Party's new disciplinary panel. :: Daniel Poulter Dr Poulter has also been referred to the new panel after fellow Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he heard three female Conservatives discussing his behaviour towards them. A spokesman for Dr Poulter said he ""denies all allegations of misconduct or inappropriate behaviour and will vigorously defend himself against any such claims"". :: Stephen Crabb Former cabinet minister and leadership contender Stephen Crabb was referred to the disciplinary panel on Saturday after admitting he said some ""pretty outrageous things"" in text messages to a 19-year-old woman who applied for a job in his office. The incident was reported to have happened before Mr Crabb resigned from Cabinet in July 2016 citing family reasons, which followed separate allegations he sent suggestive text messages to a young woman. : Charlie Elphicke The Dover and Deal MP said he did not know the nature of the ""serious allegations"" referred to police after he was suspended from the party last Friday. He denied any wrongdoing and said the media had been informed of his suspension before he knew of it. :: Mark Garnier The Cabinet Office is investigating whether the international trade minister broke the ministerial code after he admitted asking a former aide to buy sex toys. The Wyre Forest MP also confirmed his former secretary's allegation that he called her ""sugart***"" but he strongly denied sexual harassment. :: Sir Michael Fallon The Defence Secretary resigned last week after admitting his personal conduct had ""fallen below the high standards we require of the armed forces"". He had already apologised for putting his hand on journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer's knee at a Conservative party conference 15 years ago. He was subsequently accused of making lewd remarks - which he denies - to Cabinet colleague Andrea Leadsom and of ""lunging"" at political reporter Jane Merrick in 2003. A friend of Sir Michael told Sky News the former defence secretary ""realises this kind of incident was unacceptable, which is why he resigned"". Labour :: Clive Lewis A party member has accused the Norwich South MP of groping her at the party conference in Brighton last month. Labour said it was investigating a formal complaint against Mr Lewis. The former shadow minister said he was ""vigorously"" disputing the allegation and added: ""I know how I roll. I don't squeeze women's buttocks."" :: Kelvin Hopkins Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh claimed Mr Hopkins hugged her inappropriately after a student event in 2014 and later sent an inappropriate text. Mr Hopkins admitted using the wording described in the text message but ""absolutely and categorically"" denied engaging in inappropriate conduct. Mr Hopkins has been suspended by the party. :: Unnamed senior figure Bex Bailey - a former member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - said she was 19 when she was raped in 2011 by a senior party figure who was not an MP. She said when she confided in a senior party official two years later she was discouraged from reporting the attack. Labour has launched an internal investigation. :: Carl Sargeant The Welsh Assembly's cabinet secretary for communities and children was suspended by Labour following allegations about his ""personal conduct"". Mr Sargeant called for an independent investigation ""to allow me to clear my name"". SNP :: Mark McDonald The Scottish childcare minister resigned over allegations regarding his private life. In a statement released on Saturday, the SNP MSP for Aberdeen Donside apologised and said he was standing down as minister because ""some of my previous actions"" were ""considered to be inappropriate""."

It is claimed the papers suggest Mr Moshiri was gifted funds by the Russian oligarch to buy a joint 30% stake in Arsenal. Mr Moshiri sold his shares to Mr Usmanov in February 2016, with the businessman going on to purchase a 49.9% holding in Everton last year. The claims were seen as raising questions about who actually owns what in which club and whether Premier League ownership rules - which forbid any large investor from having holdings in multiple clubs - have been broken in the process. :: Corbyn vows to 'come down hard' on tax avoiders Mr Usmanov and Mr Moshiri have denied any wrongdoing. The Russian's legal representatives said there were factual errors in the allegations, including claims that the company used to oversee Mr Moshiri's purchase of the Merseyside club in 2016 was owned by Mr Usmanov. Lawyers for the Iranian-born British investor have said he is independently wealthy - telling BBC Panorama that he funded his football investments himself. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has called on the Premier League to investigate. The Premier League issued a statement to Sky clarifying its ownership rules, saying it would not disclose confidential information about clubs. But it added: ""The Premier League has wide-ranging rules in the areas of club ownership and finance. ""These include prospective new owners having to meet the Premier League Board and provide extensive detail on the sources and sufficiency of funding they have in place. ""They must also submit information on the financial structure of any proposed investment, and a business plan demonstrating that all liabilities can be met for at least 12 months ahead. ""The League prohibits any club owner or director from having an interest in another club, or the ability to influence another club's policies. ""Should a prospective club owner have previously held shares in a different club, they must provide evidence that they have been divested. ""Only when these and many other rules have been applied, and due diligence completed, will the Premier League Board allow an investment to proceed."""
2017-11-06,"As the allegations keep coming thick and fast, the atmosphere in Westminster is febrile.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171107003212/http://news.sky.com/story/sex-pest-scandal-engulfing-westminster-worse-than-expenses-11112503,"I've heard senior figures in both major parties warning darkly that this is worse than the expenses scandal which rocked British politics in 2009. It certainly has many similar elements - a oversight regime which was revealed to be not fit for purpose, a drip-drip of allegations turning into a flood, and the risk that all MPs will be tarred as sex pests due to the behaviour of a small number. :: Fallon quit after No 10 told of sex assault claim The veteran Conservative MP Gary Streeter hit an unwelcome nerve for many in his party when he warned on Twitter that this felt like the John Major years - ""no majority, no money, ripping ourselves apart over the EU. That lasted five years. Oh dear"". Twenty years later, there are fears in the party that yet again the Conservatives could again be riven apart on Europe and then destroyed by sleaze. It's hard to believe that this barely began a week ago, when it was reported in a newspaper that a Whatsapp group of female Parliamentary staff were sharing experiences about inappropriate behaviour. Within days the scandal had reached Theresa May's government with the trade minister Mark Garnier the first to be accused and defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday, the first scalp to be claimed. :: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline Few in the Conservative party now think his resignation will be the last, in a scandal which threatens to derail not just the reputation of politics, but the delicate Cabinet balance Mrs May relies on to keep her fragile administration together. That her key ally, the de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green is under investigation over claims by the writer Kate Maltby that he touched her knee and wrote her an inappropriate text message, will be a source of worry to No 10. Developments in the Labour party are if anything even more serious, with the allegation by activist Bex Bailey that she was raped by a senior party figure and advised against reporting it by party officials. NEC member Jasmin Beckett has told Sky News that more victims were waiting in the wings, and called on her party to help them come forward. Allegations have already resulted in the suspension of Corbyn ally Kelvin Hopkins, 76, over claims - stringently denied - that he inappropriately touched an activist 50 years his junior; and an investigation into Clive Lewis, who denies he groped a woman at the party's conference. Both men served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. In fact Mr Hopkins was promoted to shadow culture secretary last summer, months after the leader's office was made aware that he had been reprimanded for sending the activist a suggestive text message. The senior Labour MPs, as well as Mr Green, are adamant that the allegations are untrue, and Mr Lewis even accused his accuser of lying. There is deep anger in Westminster at the way these allegations are coming out because, at least in part as a result of the failure of the political parties' processes, victims are instead going public before due process can take place. A list of around 40 Conservative MPs compiled by party staff, and circulating on social media, has been blamed for muddying the waters between MPs having affairs or relationships with colleagues; along with unsubstantiated accusations of harassment. Some MPs on the list have already come out to denounce the claims as lies, such as the Penrith MP Rory Stewart, whose researcher has backed him up. But as both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn scramble to get a grip on the scandal, events are moving fast. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party on Friday night and serious allegations referred to the police, responded angrily that the media were told about his suspension before he was and that he was not aware of the claim. The Prime Minister has issued a new code of conduct and allegations hotline for all representatives of her party, and the Labour leader said an independent specialist organisation would be appointed to handle complaints in the future. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the ""dam has broken"" in Westminster, according to Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said it was time for the ""male-dominated professionsâ¦where the boys' own locker room culture has prevailed"" to clean up. Westminster is not a normal work environment. MPs hire their own staff - often plucked from thousands who want to work at the heart of politics - and those staff can expect a different work culture depending on whether their boss is a 30-year-old, who has come from a career in business, or a 70-year-old, who has been in politics for decades. Drinking and socialising in Parliament's bars, but also away on by-elections and party conferences, can be part and parcel. Few MPs doubt that this is a watershed moment for the behaviour of parliamentarians and how Westminster is scrutinised. It is hoped that higher standards of conduct will eventually result. But as with expenses, things could get a lot worse before they get better."
2017-11-06,"The man who shot dead 26 people at a smalltown Texas church carried out the attack after a ""domestic situation"" with his family and his in-laws, officials have revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171107003212/http://news.sky.com/story/texas-gunman-devin-kelley-sent-threatening-texts-to-mother-in-law-before-attack-11116660,"Public safety officials said Devin Kelley had sent ""threatening text messages"" to his mother-in-law in the lead-up to the incident, which saw an 18-month-old toddler among the victims. Officers said he phoned his father following the massacre to tell him he had been shot. Following the attack, he exchanged gunfire with two men who chased his car off the road, said Sheriff Joe Tackitt. He died soon afterwards of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. ""There was some gunfire exchanged, I believe, on the roadway also, and then (the shooter's vehicle) wrecked out,"" Sheriff Tackitt said. Officers said they believed the motive for the attack was the domestic situation within his family and in-laws, and that it was not religious or racial. Kelley shot worshippers during Sunday service at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. Sheriff Tackitt told CNN that Kelley's in-laws went to the church ""from time to time"" but were not there during the attack. The 26-year-old wore black tactical gear and a ballistic vest as he opened fire with an automatic assault rifle in the small town of around 400 people. Donald Trump has described the shooting as an ""act of evil"". ""Our hearts are broken but in dark times, and these are dark times, such as these, Americans do what they do best,"" he said. :: The macabre choreography of US mass shootings The victims range in age from 18 months to 77 and include Annabelle Pomeroy, the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor. Crystal Holcombe was killed alongside three of her children and her in-laws, her cousin Nick Uhlig told the Houston Chronicle and Associated Press. Twenty others were injured, including a six-year-old boy named Rylan who needed surgery after being shot four times, his uncle told CBS. Martha Rendon, an official at the University Health System hospital in San Antonio, said five of those injured, including three children, remained in hospital in a serious or critical condition. The patients are aged between four and 57. Sheriff Tackitt said there was probably ""no way"" for people to escape once Kelley opened fire. ""It's unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenceless people."" As Kelley finished the massacre and tried to escape in his car, a neighbour opened fire and gave chase with another man. ""His vehicle was parked, door open, engine running... him and the neighbour across the street (were) exchanging fire,"" said Johnnie Langendorff. ""The gentleman with me got out, rested his rifle on my hood and aimed at him, telling him to 'get out, get out'. ""There was no movement, the guy didn't put up a fight or anything."" Kelley was found dead with several weapons in his vehicle. The shooting comes about a month after gunman Stephen Paddock killed 58 people in Las Vegas - the worst shooting in modern US history. Mr Trump said the Texas mass murder was not a ""guns situation"" but a ""mental health problem at the highest level"". :: Sky Views: Protecting gun rights as victims go broke ""We are dealing with the largest mass shooting in our state's history,"" said Texas Governor Greg Abbott. He added: ""There's so many families who have lost family members. Fathers, mothers, sons and daughters."" The politician also told ABC's Good Morning America he did not think the incident was ""just a random act of violence"". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has sent his condolences to Mr Trump over the shooting, according to the Kremlin. Kelley lived in New Braunfels, Texas, near San Antonio, but officials said he did not appear to be linked to any terror groups. Domestic terrorism is defined by the FBI as an attack by a person or group that ""espouse extremist ideologies of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature"". The US Air Force said he had served in the logistics readiness squadron until being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct after being court-martialled on charges of assaulting his wife and their child. And according to court records, he was previously cited for cruelty to animals but the misdemeanour was dismissed after he paid a fine. The manager of a Texas vacation resort has confirmed Kelley worked as a security guard there. Claudia Varjabedian, manager at the Summit Vacation Resort, said Kelley had been working at the resort for the past month-and-a-half. She said he ""seemed like a nice guy"" and was unarmed during his daytime shifts. Investigators are examining posts Kelley may have made on social media in the days before the shooting, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon. Kelley's Facebook page has been deleted, but cached photos include one of what appeared to be an assault rifle with the caption: ""she's a bad b****""."

It goes like thisâ¦ ""The Deputy Prime Minister - the PM's closest ally - is accused of sexual harassment and it's claimed there was 'extreme' pornography on his computer. ""The Foreign Secretary has complicated a political prisoner's life by giving wrong information to a committee of MPs about what she was doing in Iran. ""Another Cabinet minister went to see the Israeli Prime Minister and other top officials while she was on her summer holiday, as you do, without telling the Foreign Office or Number 10. ""The Defence Secretary has quit after touching a female journalist's knee, 'lunging' at another female scribbler and allegedly making lewd comments to a female Cabinet colleagueâ¦"" The publisher interrupts: ""No, no, this is all too far-fetched. No one will believe any of this could happen."" But you're not finished, not by a long way. ""There's more! There's more!"" you protest. ""That's not all."" ""There are seven Tory MPs accused of behaving inappropriately. One's being referred to police. Another is a gynaecologist accused of putting his hand up women's skirts. ""And a Government whip called Pincher - yes, Pincher! - is accused of making unwanted sexual advances to a 6ft 8in male Olympic rower."" By now the publisher is laughing so much they're in pain. ""Stop! Stop!"" they scream. ""This is ridiculous. None of this is credible. Go away. Get out of my office."" You protest again: ""But I haven't even mentioned the minister and the sex toys yet. ""Or a 76-year-old left-wing Labour MP who is accused of sending flirty texts to a young woman activistâ¦"" :: Westminster scandal: Who is accused of what? Unbelievable? If you thought after the EU referendum, Donald Trump's victory and June's general election that politics couldn't get any more unpredictable, think again. For Theresa May, her plight goes from bad to worse - and then to perilously close to terminal. How much longer can the current catalogue of political disasters continue before the game's up for her? Last week, Conservative MPs were comparing the terrible Tory turmoil over Brexit and now ""Pestminster"" to John Major's troubles over Maastricht, ""Back to Basics"" and the ministerial sex scandals of the 1990s. But at least the Major government soldiered on for five years, from 1992-97. Now MPs are comparing 2017 with the demise of Harold Macmillan's government in 1962-63, triggered by the Profumo scandal. The only difference is that Mrs May is too weak to carry out a ""Night of the Long Knives"" as Macmillan did and sack sleazy or incompetent ministers. Another comparison now being made by many MPs is that the sexual harassment scandal is potentially even more serious than the expenses scandal of 2009, although fewer MPs are involved, admittedly. But while a lot of the current political plot is pure farce, some of it is deadly serious. Many MPs say Boris Johnson's buffoonery and blunders are no longer a joke and his gaffe about political prisoner Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has at best complicated her legal case, at worst put her life in grave danger. No wonder Labour MPs, led by shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and the Ratcliffes' local MP Tulip Siddiq, have demanded Mr Johnson's resignation or his dismissal by the Prime Minister. Fat chance, though. At least Priti Patel was hauled into 10 Downing Street for a reprimand after it was revealed she met Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli government figures on her summer holiday. One can imagine the conversation when Mrs May met the Israeli PM in Downing Street last week: ""Hello, Theresa. That nice young woman in your Government, Priti Patel, came to see me in Jerusalem during the summer."" ""What?!"" the PM might have exclaimed. Now Number 10 has revealed: ""The Prime Minister has met with the secretary of state and reminded her of her obligation which exists under the ministerial code."" Ah yes, the ministerial code! It's taking quite a beating at the moment, what with Cabinet Office inquiries into the Damian Green harassment and porn allegations and into International Trade minister Mark Garnier and his sex toys. The Prime Minister's official spokesman was forced to answer questions about why Mrs May hasn't sacked Ms Patel. Rather lamely, he said the PM has full confidence in both Mr Johnson and Ms Patel. Later, Mrs May tried to get on the front foot amid the various crises engulfing her Government by calling the other party leaders to a meeting to agree moves to tackle Westminster's sex pests and workplace bullies. But critics will claim a working group to set up a new grievance procedure and upgrade an existing complaints hotline to a face-to-face human resources service is a pretty feeble response. They should put the Labour MP Jess Phillips on their working group. Delivering her verdict on the PM's meeting, she said: ""Find this utterly disappointing. Great, a grievance procedure - the victims will be thrilled. What if they don't work in Parliament? ""What about sanctions, what about specialist support from actual professionals who know what they are talking about on sexual violence/harassment. ""So if you don't work in Parliament and an MP assaults you, or MP's staff does. How will this help?"" How, indeed? Mrs May risks looking as flat-footed in her response to this sex scandal as Gordon Brown was to expenses. And she's a vicar's daughter, after all! Who better to clean up Parliament? Still think it's unbelievable. You'd better believe it. Now, where's my publisher's phone number?"
2017-11-06,"The Queen's private estate has been accused of investing millions of pounds in offshore tax havens, it has been revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171107003212/http://news.sky.com/story/queens-private-estate-invests-in-offshore-tax-havens-11115644,"The investments by the Duchy of Lancaster emerged after the leak of a massive cache of documents being dubbed the Paradise Papers. The documents have been obtained and analysed by a range of worldwide media organisations including the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Suddeutsche Zeitung, The Guardian and the BBC. There is nothing to suggest that any of the investments are illegal. Suddeutsche Zeitung, a German newspaper, alleged that in 2005, the Duchy of Lancaster invested $7.5m (Â£5.7m) in Dover Street VI Cayman Fund. The Cayman Islands charges no direct tax on the earnings made by companies operating in the British Overseas Territory. While the Queen pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy of Lancaster, any funds the Duchy owns that are listed in tax free havens may be able to escape paying tax, thereby boosting their income. Speaking about the leak at the CBI conference, Theresa May said individuals and businesses should ""pay the tax that is due"". But she would not commit to introducing a public ownership register for offshore companies and trusts or opening a public inquiry into tax avoidance. Suddeutsche Zeitung also alleged that Dover Street further invested in a subsidiary company called Vision Capital Partners VI B LP to buy into two UK retail chains, one of which was BrightHouse. BrightHouse is the UK's largest rent-to-own firm and has been accused by a Parliamentary committee of charging inflated prices to some of the poorest people in the country.In December 2014, the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Debt and Personal Finance found that a Hotpoint tumble dryer on sale for Â£229 at Curry's would cost BrightHouse customers Â£780 once interest, compulsory insurance and service cover was taken into account. In February 2015, chair of the APPG Yvonne Fovargue MP, releasing a report into rent-to-own firms, said: ""Rent to Own Stores like BrightHouse charge inflated prices to some of the poorest people in the country. Customers are often obliged to take out additional warranties and insurance, as a result paying several times the true value of the goods."" The chief executive of BrightHouse said at the time he was disappointed with the report's findings, and claimed his company provided high quality and competitively priced products. Just last week, it emerged BrightHouse had agreed to reimburse customers to the value of nearly Â£15m after agreeing a compensation package with the Financial Conduct Authority, following a two-year investigation. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Dover Street investment was bought in 2005 and forms only 0.3% of the total value of the Duchy. ""The Duchy's investment in BrightHouse is through a third party and equates to Â£3,208 - just 0.0006% of the Duchy's value. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" Anti-monarchy groups said the revelations showed the Queen must be open and transparent about her investments and the tax she pays on them. Graham Smith, the CEO of Republic, said: ""The Queen's personal wealth and investments mean she has a direct interest in government decisions about tax. Yet we have no way of knowing if undue influence has been used by the royal household to protect these investments. ""The Queen now needs to come clean, to set the highest standards of transparency and probity in her financial affairs."""

The couple were at home with their dogs when the firework hit their roof and exploded at 7.45pm on Saturday. ""It was just a normal Saturday night,"" said Mrs Bagshaw, 63. ""It was all fine until I suddenly heard what sounded like an Exocet missile. ""It shook the whole house - I now know how earthquake victims feel. ""I have worked with explosives and I have pushed the button to demolish cooling towers, but I can honestly say I've never heard an explosion like that."" Her husband Ted, 69, suffered an angina attack - which occurs when the blood supply to the heart's muscles is restricted - after the incident. The retired police officer was forced to lie down for an hour at their neighbour's house to recover. The couple initially thought their house had survived relatively intact. ""We thought it was just a couple of tiles off the roof at first,"" said Mrs Bagshaw. ""But then a young man drove by and said, 'do you know your roof is on fire?'"" The damage to the house ended up being so severe that they have been forced to move into a nearby hotel in Littleover, and will not be able to return until Easter next year. Mrs Bagshaw continued: ""We'll miss Christmas here, Ted's 70th birthday, our 40th wedding anniversary will be coming up. ""My house is devastated, we have lost everything.""

2017-11-06,Jeremy Corbyn has suggested the Queen should apologise if her private estate invested Â£10m offshore to avoid paying tax in Britain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171107003212/http://news.sky.com/story/paradise-papers-john-mcdonnell-says-theresa-may-may-have-questions-to-answer-11115857,"The Labour leader pledged to ""come down hard"" on tax avoiding companies and individuals after the ""Paradise Papers"" leak shone a spotlight on the financial affairs of the super-rich - including the monarch. He said anyone involved in the ""shocking"" leak should say sorry if they invested offshore to avoid tax - and also ""recognise what it does to our society"". Mr Corbyn was speaking after his colleague - shadow chancellor John McDonnell - said Theresa May has ""questions to answer"" amid reports that Tory donor Lord Ashcroft continued to avoid tax in the UK after it was believed he had given up his non-dom status. The leaked documents suggest Lord Ashcroft, who has given millions to the Tories, had a previously unknown offshore trust which at one point was worth over Â£300m. :: Paradise Papers: Queen's private estate invests in offshore tax havens Reports based on the documents also suggest the former Conservative Party treasurer retained non-domiciled tax status in Belize at a time when it was generally thought he had given up the status. While most Britons have to pay tax on everything they earn, non-doms can enjoy the benefits of UK residency while avoiding taxes by channelling earnings through a home abroad. In a statement, Lord Ashcroft denied involvement in any appropriate action and said he had complied with the new residency rules introduced in 2010. The investigation of around 13.4 million files - by The Guardian, the BBC, Suddeutsche Zeitung and other media outlets - details the financial dealings of the rich and powerful, some 18 months after the disclosure of the Panama Papers sent shockwaves through the world of business. Asked about the monarch at the CBI conference, Mr Corbyn said: ""Well anyone that is putting money into tax havens in order to avoid taxation in Britain, and obviously investigations have to take place, should do two things - not just apologise for it but also recognise what it does to our society."" ""Because if the very wealthy person wants to avoid taxation in Britain and therefore put money into a tax haven somewhere, who loses? Schools, hospitals, housing, all those public services lose and the rest of the population have topay to cover up the deficit created by that. Mr Corbyn's office later clarified that he was not calling for he Queen to personally say sorry. The Labour leader also called for a public inquiry into tax avoidance and evasion, an ownership register of companies and trusts, a new tax enforcement unit in HMRC and an end to public contracts for companies abusing the system. He also warned Labour would look at using a withholding tax to punish individuals or companies involved in abusing the system. The Labour leader added: ""Please understand the public anger and consternation at the scale of tax avoidance revealed yet again today. ""We are talking about tens of billions that are effectively being leached from our vital public services by a super-rich elite that holds the taxation system and the rest of us in contempt."" At the CBI conference in east London, Mrs May said individuals and businesses should ""pay the tax that is due"" - but she refused to commit to introducing a public register of who owns offshore companies and trusts. Lord Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, told The Guardian that the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures, and that ""any suggestion or implication that he has will be vigorously challenged"". The Panama Papers resulted in lasting damage for a number of the figures named, including Iceland's Prime Minister, who stepped down after suggestions he held investments in Iceland's collapsed banks, and former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable called for MPs to investigate the claims about the Paradise Papers. Responding to the latest revelations, a government spokeswoman said: ""Since 2010, the Government has secured an additional Â£160bn, more than the annual UK NHS budget, for our vital public services by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance. ""This includes more than Â£2.8bn from those trying to hide money abroad to avoid paying what they owe. There are 26,000 HMRC staff tackling tax avoidance and evasion, and we have provided an extra Â£800m to fund their efforts. ""A fair tax system is a critical and key part of our plan to build a fairer society, and we are clear that everyone must pay what is due, at the right time."""

""I still at this point wanted to protect my Mum, so I said 'Dad's drunk again, so pick us up out the front', so she picked us up out the front and we went home. ""More recently I've had conversations with my Mum - she kind of maintains that he didn't actually die then but he was dead within a couple of days of that incident. ""It's affected my adult life entirely, although I had no idea that it had."" Mr Connelly stopped drinking at the age of 24, but struggled to come to terms with his emotions, leaving him contemplating suicide. He said: ""I made a conscious intellectual decision as a 25-year-old man that this world would be better off without me."" He decided to spend one more weekend with his then four children, and found he developed a new bond with them which gave him a ""taste of what life should be like"". Mr Connelly said children with alcoholic parents blame themselves, and more needs to be done to stop them developing problems of their own. He said: ""Most children of alcoholics that I speak to, whether they become alcoholics, drug addicts, suffer from any kind of mental health issues, most of them can whittle down the feeling they felt when they grew up to pain. ""And knowing how many children that are dealing with parents who drink, we need to be doing something about it as a society because at the moment we don't. ""There are children all over the country who have absolutely no idea what they're suffering from, all they know is that they're suffering from pain and they think it's their fault."" The charity has said living in homes where alcohol or drugs are being misused can lead to mental health problems for teenagers. It has called on the Government to address the ""funding gap"" for local council children's services. Matthew Reed, chief executive, said: ""The hundreds of thousands of children whose parent has a drinking problem are sadly just the tip of the iceberg of children in desperate need of support. ""At a time when demand for council children's services is rising, severe funding cuts from central government are leaving more and more to deal with these huge problems alone."""
2017-11-07,The Duchess of Cambridge showed off her emerging baby bump as she attended a gala dinner for a childrenâs mental health charity.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108205749/http://news.sky.com/story/duchess-of-cambridge-shows-off-baby-bump-at-gala-dinner-11117988,"Pictures taken at Tuesday evening's event at Kensington Palace's 18th century Orangery, show Kate's baby bump beginning to show. She met supporters and those who have been helped by the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families (AFNCCF) at a reception before the dinner to celebrate the charity. The 35-year-old patron of the charity, who is pregnant with her third child, had been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe form of morning sickness. But in recent weeks Kate has stepped back out into the limelight and is now in her second trimester and due to give birth in April. The Duke and Duchess announced the pregnancy in September with Kensington Palace issuing a statement in which the Queen was said to be ""delighted"" with the news. It read: ""Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child. ""The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news. ""As with her previous two pregnancies, the Duchess is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum."" The Duchess gave birth to her first child Prince George in 2013 and her second child Princess Charlotte in 2015. Speaking of the event, Peter Fonagy, the chief executive of the Anna Freud Centre, said Kate was ""very interested in maternal mental health"". He said: ""One of the things that we are interested in is intervening as early as possible in children's lives to improve their chances of good mental health throughout life. ""She's particularly concerned that mothers' mental health plays a major role in this and that we are able to support mothers to support their children."""
2017-11-07,"One thing Marks and Spencer has been excellent at during recent years, whatever you think of it as a retailer, has been its ability to downplay City expectations ahead of publication of its results.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108205749/http://news.sky.com/story/how-will-ms-measure-up-as-changes-accelerate-11118775,"The latest were no exception. The market had been primed for half year pre-tax profits, on an underlying basis, of Â£200m. An outturn of Â£219.1m, then, came as a pleasant surprise to investors, even if it did represent a drop of 5.3% on the same period last year. There was another pleasant surprise in the clothing performance - long the Achilles heel for M&S. :: M&S signals more store closures in shake-up Total clothing and home sales during the most recent quarter were actually up 0.6% on the same period last year while, on a like-for-like basis (which measures sales in stores trading in the same format for the last year or more) they were down by a mere 0.1%. That was better than most M&S-watchers had been expecting. There are growing indications that the decline in clothing has been stemmed and Steve Rowe, the chief executive, could point to the fact that M&S has cut the number of sales in clothing and home from nine to four while also cutting back on promotions. That is showing up in further improvement in margins. That was the good - or, at least, the reasonably positive - news. More disappointing was the admission that like-for-like sales of food, undoubtedly the strongest card for M&S during the last decade, fell by 0.1% both during the latest quarter and during the first half of the year as a whole. Total food sales were up by 4.4%, reflecting new store openings, but Mr Rowe was warning ominously about the ""headwinds facing our food business"" having ""intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". Accordingly, while Mr Rowe insists ""investment returns remain high"", the company is reining back on expansion of its popular Simply Food chain. It is not difficult to detect the hand of Archie Norman, the new M&S chairman, in either this decision or in the departure of Helen Weir, the chief financial officer, whose exit was first reported last night by Sky's Mark Kleinman. Mr Norman, who succeeded the urbane former investment banker Robert Swannell in September, is a hard-driving turnaround expert still revered in the City for the way, a quarter of a century ago, he and Allan Leighton rescued Asda from collapse before selling it to Wal-Mart for Â£6.7bn in 1999. Most sector-watchers who know him reckon Mr Norman will be pushing the likeable Mr Rowe to accelerate the pace of change at M&S and in particular the speed at which the retailer brings down its costs. As M&S seeks to place greater emphasis on its digital sales, Mr Rowe had previously announced plans to close 30 of its larger stores, but insists now that was the ""minimum"" and that M&S would ""go faster"" in closing underperforming stores. The company confirmed that, by 2022, it will have 60 fewer stores than it did in 2016 - yet many will question whether it could not be reducing its space by more. By then, meanwhile, M&S aims to be making a third of its sales online. Other questions remain. One is over Mr Rowe's recent appointment of Jill McDonald as head of clothing and home. Ms McDonald is well-regarded, due to successful stints as managing director of McDonald's UK and as chief executive of Halfords, but some investors worry about her lack of specific experience in fashion, particularly as her appointment triggered the departure of the former head of clothing, Jo Jenkins. The concern is understandable. Fashion, particularly women's fashion, is the fulcrum of M&S. Get that right and absolutely everything else follows. Ever since the late Sir Richard Greenbury retired nearly 19 years ago, M&S has had a string of leaders - Peter Salsbury, Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes, Sir Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland - who have all grappled with trying to either stem decline or revive the group's fortunes. That said, in Mr Norman and Mr Rowe, M&S probably has as good a combination of chairman and chief executive as it could hope for in seeking to achieve the latter. In Mr Norman, it has someone who will agitate for rapid and even radical change, but who also boasts experience of transforming a low-growth retailer into a high-growth one. In Mr Rowe, meanwhile, it has someone who has spent almost his entire career at M&S, who is steeped in its values, who loves the business, who understands its staff and customers and who can use that as potent weapons in driving change. As demonstrated by the warm response to its Christmas advertisements featuring Paddington Bear, there is still massive public goodwill towards M&S, probably greater than any other retailer enjoys with the possible exception of John Lewis. That is a fabulous platform on which to build."
2017-11-07,A merger has been agreed that could see two of the so-called 'big six' household energy suppliers join forces - if regulators agree.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108205749/http://news.sky.com/story/sse-and-npower-agree-energy-supply-merger-to-create-big-five-11118172,"SSE said the scale of change in the market, that has included Government plans to cap the most expensive tariffs, prompted it to agree a tie-up with npower's parent company - Germany's Innogy. It will see the two firms merge their household energy supply and services businesses in the UK, creating a new firm that would be listed in London. SSE would hold 65.6% of the stock in the new entity under the plans. The pair, which revealed advanced discussions on a deal earlier this week, hope shareholder approval will be completed by next summer. A tie-up would consolidate SSE as the country's second-largest supplier of household energy behind Centrica-owned British Gas, with a combined customer base of more than 11 million customers. :: Tie-up plans as firms face customer exodus SSE said it would help them compete in a ""competitive and regulatory environment"" as well as realise efficiency savings. The industry is under pressure to scrap controversial standard variable tariffs, which were described as a ""rip-off"" by the Prime Minister and which are often the most expensive in the market. The default rates are currently paid by almost half of UK households, despite a pick-up in switching rates. News that a merger between SSE and loss-making npower had been agreed was made as the former announced a 40% drop in pre-tax profits to Â£402m - blaming higher investment costs. SSE boss Alistair Phillips-Davies said: ""The scale of change in the energy market means we believe a separation of our household energy and services business and the proposed merger with npower will enable both entities to focus more acutely on pursuing their own dedicated strategies, and will ultimately better serve customers, employees and other stakeholders."" Competition concerns would be likely to dominate any regulatory investigation, though the industry insists it is currently healthy with 60 suppliers now challenging for business. An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""Our role is to represent the interest of consumers. It is not part of our jurisdiction to decide on a merger. ""However, we would advise relevant authorities if we were concerned that a merger would not be in consumers' interests."""

He is also believed to be part of the team that prepares Mr Corbyn to face Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions. When asked about the reasons for Mr Prescott's suspension, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on staffing matters."" Mr Prescott, who is the son of former deputy prime minister John Prescott, made an unsuccessful bid to be selected as Labour's candidate in Hull West and Hessle ahead of June's election. After six happy years at @Commucan, I'm proud to confirm that from December I'll be @jeremycorbyn's new Political Advisor & Speechwriter. He lost to Tory incumbent Sir Edward Leigh in Gainsborough as a parliamentary candidate at the 2015 election. He also previously failed to be selected to stand for the party in his father's old Hull East seat ahead of the 2010 election, after which Mr Prescott senior was appointed to the House of Lords. Mr Prescott joined Mr Corbyn's office in October last year, having spent six years at communications consultancy Commucan. Prior to his appointment, Mr Prescott used a blog post to call for a ""much sharper operation in Corbyn's office and an increased level of professionalism"" from the Labour leader inside and outside Parliament."

""This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past."" In a stern warning to Pyongyang, Mr Trump said: ""Do not underestimate us, do not try us.

""It has broken all of those commitments."" Mr Trump offered North Koreans a ""path towards a much better future"", having urged the regime to ""come to the table"" and ""make a deal"" over its nuclear programme. These were calls echoed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in when he joined Mr Trump for a news conference on Tuesday. The US President was forced to cancel an unannounced visit to the de-militarised zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea due to bad weather. The Marine One presidential helicopter left Seoul early on Wednesday and flew most of the way to the DMZ, but was forced to turn back just five minutes out due to fog. Mr Trump heads to China later, where he is expected to seek President Xi Jinping's commitment to exerting further pressure on North Korea. In his speech in Seoul, Mr Trump had singled out China, along with Russia, for its alliance with North Korea, saying: ""You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept."" He also referenced the visit came a year on from his victory in the US election, adding he would be ""celebrating"" the achievement with the South Korean people."

They said the 49-year-old had not been informed of the detail of the allegations before he was found dead, meaning he was not afforded ""common courtesy, decency or natural justice"". They also said warnings had been made about Mr Sargeant's ""mental welfare"" before his death on Tuesday, which is not being treated as suspicious. Until last week, the married father-of-two was Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children in the Welsh Government before being removed from his role and suspended by Labour. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones revealed he felt he had no choice but to order an investigation after being made aware of ""certain incidents"" with women allegedly involving Mr Sargeant. According to a letter sent to the Labour Party on Monday, Mr Sargeant's solicitor Hugh Bowden had demanded immediate details of the allegations, along with the names of complainants and information on how the complaints were first made and initially investigated. The correspondence revealed there was an anticipated hearing date of 16 January, while Mr Bowden added the ""ongoing delay"" of him being made aware of the detail of the allegations was ""both prejudicial to the preparation of our client's case but also to his physical and mental wellbeing"". An email sent by Mr Bowden to the party also expressed concern Mr Jones' comments to the media, in the wake of Mr Sargeant's suspension, were ""clearly prejudicing what is allegedly an independent enquiry"". The solicitor also warned about witnesses' evidence being ""manipulated"".

""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" Mr Sargeant's former colleague Jenny Rathbone, the Cardiff Central AM, has also raised concerns about the handling of the allegations. She said: ""It is a basic fairness that you have got to know what the accusations are against you in order to be able to respond but that doesn't mean to say we don't need to take allegations seriously, we obviously do. ""Other people say that even yesterday morning he did not know what the allegations were. ""It must have been devastating for him in the last few days.

He was taken to court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and on Wednesday, a judge at Maidstone County Court ruled such discrimination was unlawful. Mr Wilson was handed a three-year injunction, which means he is not allowed to stop tenants renting from him because of their race. If he does not comply, he could face a fine or jail for contempt of court. Regarded as one of Britain's biggest buy-to-let investors, Mr Wilson owns hundreds of properties in Kent.

It certainly has many similar elements - a oversight regime which was revealed to be not fit for purpose, a drip-drip of allegations turning into a flood, and the risk that all MPs will be tarred as sex pests due to the behaviour of a small number. :: Fallon quit after No 10 told of sex assault claim The veteran Conservative MP Gary Streeter hit an unwelcome nerve for many in his party when he warned on Twitter that this felt like the John Major years - ""no majority, no money, ripping ourselves apart over the EU. That lasted five years. Oh dear"". Twenty years later, there are fears in the party that yet again the Conservatives could again be riven apart on Europe and then destroyed by sleaze. It's hard to believe that this barely began a week ago, when it was reported in a newspaper that a Whatsapp group of female Parliamentary staff were sharing experiences about inappropriate behaviour. Within days the scandal had reached Theresa May's government with the trade minister Mark Garnier the first to be accused and defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday, the first scalp to be claimed. :: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline Few in the Conservative party now think his resignation will be the last, in a scandal which threatens to derail not just the reputation of politics, but the delicate Cabinet balance Mrs May relies on to keep her fragile administration together. That her key ally, the de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green is under investigation over claims by the writer Kate Maltby that he touched her knee and wrote her an inappropriate text message, will be a source of worry to No 10. Developments in the Labour party are if anything even more serious, with the allegation by activist Bex Bailey that she was raped by a senior party figure and advised against reporting it by party officials. NEC member Jasmin Beckett has told Sky News that more victims were waiting in the wings, and called on her party to help them come forward. Allegations have already resulted in the suspension of Corbyn ally Kelvin Hopkins, 76, over claims - stringently denied - that he inappropriately touched an activist 50 years his junior; and an investigation into Clive Lewis, who denies he groped a woman at the party's conference. Both men served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. In fact Mr Hopkins was promoted to shadow culture secretary last summer, months after the leader's office was made aware that he had been reprimanded for sending the activist a suggestive text message. The senior Labour MPs, as well as Mr Green, are adamant that the allegations are untrue, and Mr Lewis even accused his accuser of lying. There is deep anger in Westminster at the way these allegations are coming out because, at least in part as a result of the failure of the political parties' processes, victims are instead going public before due process can take place. A list of around 40 Conservative MPs compiled by party staff, and circulating on social media, has been blamed for muddying the waters between MPs having affairs or relationships with colleagues; along with unsubstantiated accusations of harassment. Some MPs on the list have already come out to denounce the claims as lies, such as the Penrith MP Rory Stewart, whose researcher has backed him up. But as both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn scramble to get a grip on the scandal, events are moving fast. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party on Friday night and serious allegations referred to the police, responded angrily that the media were told about his suspension before he was and that he was not aware of the claim. The Prime Minister has issued a new code of conduct and allegations hotline for all representatives of her party, and the Labour leader said an independent specialist organisation would be appointed to handle complaints in the future. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the ""dam has broken"" in Westminster, according to Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said it was time for the ""male-dominated professionsâ¦where the boys' own locker room culture has prevailed"" to clean up. Westminster is not a normal work environment. MPs hire their own staff - often plucked from thousands who want to work at the heart of politics - and those staff can expect a different work culture depending on whether their boss is a 30-year-old, who has come from a career in business, or a 70-year-old, who has been in politics for decades. Drinking and socialising in Parliament's bars, but also away on by-elections and party conferences, can be part and parcel. Few MPs doubt that this is a watershed moment for the behaviour of parliamentarians and how Westminster is scrutinised. It is hoped that higher standards of conduct will eventually result. But as with expenses, things could get a lot worse before they get better."
2017-11-07,"Former Welsh government minister Carl Sargeant, who was suspended last week amid allegations about incidents with women, has died.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108205749/http://news.sky.com/story/ex-welsh-minister-carl-sargeant-dead-after-suspension-11117363,"The 49-year-old served as Labour's Welsh Assembly Member for Alyn and Deeside since 2003. North Wales Police said officers were called to an address in Connah's Quay, Flintshire at about 11.30am on Tuesday, where Mr Sargeant's body was found. He is understood to have taken his own life, the Press Association reported, and police are not treating his death as suspicious. The Welsh Ambulance Service said they were called about half an hour before the police. Until last week, Mr Sargeant was Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children in the Welsh Government before being removed from his role and suspended by Labour. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones revealed he felt he had no choice but to order an investigation after being made aware of ""certain incidents"" with women allegedly involving Mr Sargeant. Mr Sargeant, who previously served in a number of other ministerial roles, had described the allegations as ""shocking and distressing"" but said the details of the claims had not been disclosed to him. He added he was looking forward to ""returning to Government once my name has been cleared"". Mr Sargeant's suspension came amid a sexual harassment scandal across all parties in British politics. I'm deeply shocked to hear of the terrible news about Carl Sargeant. My thoughts and profound sympathy are with his family and friends. Mr Sargeant was married to Bernie and they had two children, Lucy and Jack. He had lived in Connah's Quay, in his constituency, all his life. Before entering politics, the keen football fan worked at a chemical manufacturing plant and was a quality and environmental auditor and industrial firefighter. In a statement following his death, his family said: ""Carl was a much-loved husband, father and friend. ""He wasn't simply a part of our family. He was the glue that bound us together. He was the heart of our family. We loved him so very much. ""He was the most kind and caring husband, father, son and friend. We are devastated beyond words, and we know our grief will be shared by all those who knew and loved him. ""We are in shock and grief. We ask that our privacy is respected at this time."" Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter: ""My thoughts are with the friends and family of Carl Sargeant following his tragic death."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also described himself as ""shocked, horrified"" and ""deeply sympathetic"" to Mr Sargeant's family. Asked if there should be a change in the way allegations of impropriety are dealt with, Mr Corbyn added: ""All allegations must be examined and must be pursued. ""But there also has to be great pastoral care and support given to everybody involved in these accusations and also that will deal with them, all parties, as quickly as possible."" According to Sky sources, Mr Sargeant was receiving high level support from various parts of the Labour Party - both in Wales and Westminster - at the time of his death, with the purpose of checking on his well-being. Sky News understands this is standard procedure for those accused of inappropriate behaviour and that Kelvin Hopkins, the Luton North MP denying allegations of inappropriate behaviour, is also receiving support. Sky News also understands Mr Sargeant was aware of the nature of the allegations made against him. Carwyn Jones said: ""Carl was a friend as well as a colleague and I am shocked and deeply saddened by his death. ""He made a big contribution to Welsh public life and fought tirelessly for those he represented both as a minister and as a local Assembly Member. ""He will be a great loss both to our party and to the Senedd. My heartfelt sympathies are with his family at this difficult time."" The UK Government's Wales Secretary, Alun Cairns, said he was ""shocked and saddened by the tragic news"". Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""This is unspeakably sad news. Our Parliament has lost a stalwart, and many of us have lost a friend."" The Welsh Assembly suspended proceedings on Tuesday afternoon following the news."

He was rescued by firefighters but never regained consciousness and West Midlands Police launched a murder inquiry following his death in the early hours of Tuesday. His daughter, Fiona Nicholls, said the family was in shock. She said: ""He was a fun-loving, funny man. ""He was retired but worked hard all his life."" Mr Nicholls leaves behind his partner, daughter, two brothers and nieces and nephews. His 50-year-old partner managed to escape from the fire by jumping from a first floor window. She sustained fractures to her lower limbs but is expected to recover from her injuries, police said. The fire started after a large ""commercial-sized"" firework designed for outdoor displays was placed inside their home and set alight. Mr Nicholls' house caught alight quickly, with the inside being gutted. Police said they believe the firework contained about 200 tubes of explosives and would have taken just two minutes to fully discharge. Det Insp Paul Joyce, leading the murder probe, said: ""We are going through lots of CCTV and developing some lines of enquiry from that. ""This would have been a large heavy firework that would have been difficult to carry some distance, so I would ask anyone who saw someone carrying a large box in the area last Thursday night to contact us. ""Any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem to you, could help our investigation."" Information can be given to police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

After forcing the thief to return the gifts, Paddington gives him a marmalade sandwich and receives a hug in return. But the response he gets from actor Mark Benton has been heard by some viewers as less than polite. Thirlwall 14 wrote on Instagram: ""Something doesn't sound right in this new M&S advert."" Rob Souza tweeted: ""I swear the burglar says ""F*** you little bear"" to @paddingtonbear."" As festive adverts jostle for attention, both on the screen and on social media, it is unlikely to be the sort of reaction the family-friendly retailer was hoping for. But a Marks & Spencer spokesperson told Sky News: ""He's saying, 'thank you little bear'. We think it's really clear. We wouldn't change the ad."" Vetran newsreader Angela Rippon also appears in the advert, with Paddington played by the actor who voices him in the current film, Ben Whishaw. John Lewis' much-anticipated Christmas advert is yet to be released, but a mysterious Twitter account named @UnderTheBed2017 has tweeted a video of what looks like a cute animal's eyes peeping out from the darkness."

The 66-year-old was the owner of the food and retail group, which is Croatia's largest privately owned company, before it was put into state administration in April. He handed himself in at London's Charing Cross police station just after 9am on Tuesday and was detained on a European arrest warrant issued by Croatia. Hours before, Croatian authorities informed their British counterparts of his exact location in London after tracing his telephone calls. He had been on Europol's most wanted list. The fugitive, whose net worth is â¬155m (Â£136.5m), was granted bail by a judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday afternoon. Prosecutor Benjamin Seifert, appearing for the Croatian authorities, told the court Todoric faces three charges in Croatia - false accounting, fraud by false representation and abuse of position. The court heard there is a global freeze on the millionaire's assets. Under his bail conditions, he has to provide security of Â£100,000, hand over his and his wife's passports, wear an electronic tag and report to police three times a week. ""The context in which I grant you bail is the knowledge that both in this country and throughout the world your assets are frozen and your ability to obtain money is limited,"" the judge said. Writing on his well-known blog, the millionaire denied any wrongdoing and accused top Croatian officials of plotting against him for political reasons. An audit performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of Agrokor's state-appointed management showed a net loss of 11bn kuna (Â£1.28bn) last year and 3.6bn kuna (Â£420m) in 2015. Agrokor's net worth for the two years was reduced by 22bn kuna (Â£2.6bn). Suppliers, bondholders and banks, including about Â£969m held by Russia's Sberbank, provided credit to Agrokor. Timothy Otty, Todoric's lawyer, told the court his client is an extremely successful businessman who founded the group, which has been in existence for 40 years. A full extradition hearing will take place in April 2018."

Shares in the FTSE 100 retailer were volatile in response to the news - contained within its half-year results. It opened more than 4% higher before going into reverse on the admission that trading had been ""difficult"" in October, but fought back to end the session 1.6% ahead. Underlying trading profits in the six months to 30 September were 5.3% down. M&S reported a fall in like-for-like sales in its traditionally strong food division and also its clothing and home operation - with sales coming in 0.1% down and 0.7% lower respectively. It said its food side had seen tougher competition and damage to profit margins from the Brexit-hit pound, with total revenue growth of 4.4% driven by 24 new food store openings. It said its embattled clothing arm, which has dragged on its financial performance for years, had done better in the second quarter thanks to a focus on improved products at lower prices. Nevertheless, it announced plans to shut more clothing stores in areas where they were less profitable. M&S did not give any details but signalled that any job losses would be minimal as its first 30 UK clothing store closures, announced a year ago as part of chief executive Steve Rowe's drive to bolster profitability, had seen staff affected mostly being redeployed. Mr Rowe said on Wednesday: ""We have made good progress in remedying the immediate and burning issues at M&S I outlined last year."" He added: ""The business still has many structural issues to tackle as we embark on the next five years of our transformation, in the context of a very challenging retail and consumer environment. ""Today we are accelerating our plans to build a business with sustainable, profitable growth, making M&S special again."" M&S said that while it would slow openings of new food-only stores, it still planned to launch another 80 Simply Food shops over the current financial year. It also confirmed a story by Sky News on Tuesday that finance chief Helen Weir was leaving the business to pursue what it called a ""plural career"". Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said of the company's update: ""This is not a pretty set of results for M&S, which has seen its turnaround plan undermined by changing consumer shopping habits and a weaker pound. ""While the retailer can't carry the can for the knock-on effects of the Brexit vote, the prioritisation of online sales can only be seen as a pretty late arrival at the party."""

""I wanted to leave when Ed suggested 'we should all f***',"" she added. ""I said I was tired and wanted to leave,"" she said. ""Ed suggested I nap in the guest bedroom,"" she said.

2017-11-07,NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has warned five million people will be left waiting for treatment if the Government does not increase health service funding in the Budget.Â ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108205749/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-waiting-lists-to-grow-to-5m-by-2021-says-health-chief-11118284,"Mr Stevens said failure to increase funding would add one million people to the waiting list by 2021. Speaking at the NHS Providers conference in Birmingham, Mr Stevens said: ""NHS England's assessment of the funding position is that the Budget for next year falls well short of what is needed to look after patients and their families at their time of greatest need. ""On current budget, the NHS will not be able to do everything that is asked of it. ""The NHS waiting list will grow to five million people by 2021. That is one million more people, equivalent to one in 10 of us, the highest number ever."" Mr Stevens said the NHS would not be able to deliver on mental health or cancer treatment targets, and that some elective treatments may have to be ""retrenched or rationed"". He said he was speaking out ahead of the Budget because the public had ""a right to know the consequences"" of the decisions the Chancellor will make. In a blunt, strikingly political message, he also called on the Government to make good on the Vote Leave promise to divert more money to the NHS. Vote Leave's bus carried the slogan: ""We send the EU Â£350 million a week... let's fund our NHS instead."" Mr Stevens said: ""The NHS wasn't on the ballot paper, but it was on the battle bus. Vote Leave for a better funded health service - Â£350m a week. ""Rather than our criticising these clear Brexit funding commitments to NHS patients - promises entered into by Cabinet ministers and by MPs - the public want to see them honoured. ""By the end of the NHS' next financial year - March 2019 - the United Kingdom will have left the European Union. ""Trust in democratic politics will not be strengthened if anyone now tries to argue: 'You voted Brexit, partly for a better funded health service. But precisely because of Brexit, you now can't have one.'"" The Â£350m figure was hugely controversial during the referendum campaign. It was based on Vote Leave's calculation of the amount of money Britain sends to Brussels each week, but the UK Statistical Authority challenged the figure and prominent Brexiteers, including International Trade Secretary Sir Liam Fox and then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, distanced themselves from the pledge following victory. Boris Johnson revived it in September, writing that ""it would be a fine thing, as a lot of us has have said, if a lot of that (Â£350m) went on the NHS""."

It brings to an end a dispute that began in April last year, resulting in a series of strikes that have caused disruption for commuters, students and other passengers. Aslef general secretary Mike Whelan said: ""After one-and-a-half years of industrial strife we wanted to find a way forward for our members who work on the railway in this region, for the passengers who use Southern trains, and for the businesses which depend on the service, as well as for the company, too."" Southern's 300,000 passengers had been frustrated by a number of false dawns during the strike period, most recently in August when talks aimed at ending the dispute stalled. But Nick Brown, chief operating officer of Southern owners Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), said that passengers could now look forward to ""stability"" and a ""resilient and reliable service"". ""This dispute has been difficult for our passengers in particular and we are pleased that we can now move ahead and deliver stability by finally concluding this deal with Aslef,"" he said. ""Our trains will be planned to have a second person on board and this has been the arrangement we have operated over the last year. More on-train staff are on more trains with more passengers than ever before. The on-board service concept has been welcomed by our passengers across the board. ""Should, in certain circumstances, a train not have that second person on board then it will still be able to run until a replacement can be provided. Avoiding cancellations is key to us delivering a resilient and reliable service across the busiest and most congested part of the UK rail network."" :: Rail and Tube passengers face days of strike misery :: Southern Rail talks stall without agreement :: Students warn Southern Rail strikes are affecting their grades The deal has not been as well received by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, with general secretary Mick Cash insisting that its campaign would not change. Mr Cash, who on Tuesday issued a warned over the future of up to 1,400 Transport for London employees, described the agreement as ""shoddy"" and ""appalling"", adding that it ""institutionalises discrimination against disabled and older people"".

2017-11-07,"At the age of 15, Stephen Ross's face and life were shattered when an IRA bomb exploded at the war memorial in Enniskillen on Remembrance Sunday, 8 November 1987.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108205749/http://news.sky.com/story/enniskillen-bombing-survivor-i-was-shown-love-in-the-midst-of-hatred-11118030,"The bomb killed 12 people and injured 63 but what is remarkable is how Mr Ross and others have managed to put the pieces of their lives back together and to turn one of the most significant terrorist atrocities of 30 years of the Troubles into a message of hope and forgiveness for the future. Here he tells the story of his recovery: At the very time we stood remembering those who had died and who were badly injured in two world wars, both Catholic and Protestant, we did not expect to be numbered among them. It was a miracle that I survived, buried under a huge slab of concrete from the exploded building. I still remember the sound of screaming voices, the taste of concrete and blood, putting my hand in my mouth and most of my teeth had gone and not being able to feel my left leg. I was airlifted to a hospital in Londonderry where two sets of surgeons set about reconstructing my shattered face and left leg. Looking back, it showed me that there are forces of good at work; many more good people than those who planted the bomb and supported them. It was the prayers of other Christians and the letters I received in hospital that showed me love in the midst of hatred. I focused on getting better and not being angry. If I let anger take root in my life against God or against the people who support terrorism, it would ultimately consume me and affect me physically and emotionally. Eleven years later in August 1998, on the very hour of the very day I was married, the Omagh Bomb exploded, claiming 29 lives. So I am mindful of those who have to live with the loss of their father, sister, bother, son or daughter and injuries each day and with so many other tragic events from Northern Ireland's past. There will be a time for justice and answers to the questions of why we had to go through this experience this but I choose not to be discouraged by the fact that the victims of what happened in 1987 have experienced neither to date. I trust God who has forgiven me much and that enables me to forgive and to move on."
2017-11-07,"I have never hosted a radio phone-in programme in the United States before, certainly not on a conservative station in the Midwest state of Wisconsin.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108205749/http://news.sky.com/story/how-is-donald-trump-viewed-in-wisconsin-a-year-on-from-shock-win-11117702,"But given the unprecedented nature of American politics right now, it is an informative experience in at least one way. The listeners to Gerry Bader's show on WIXX 101 in Green Bay- largely white, working class and angry - helped carry Donald Trump to the narrowest of victories a year ago. :: Donald Trump wins the White House: How election night unfolded And despite everything that has happened over the first 12 months of this presidency, they would vote for him again now. ""He's fighting for us, he's on our side"", ""He kicking ISIS' butt out there"", ""He's our guy, he's doing a great job"". Caller after caller was standing by their man and urging others to do so. Yes, they do not like his Twitter rants, they do not particularly want him to pick fights with war widows and they are not overly impressed with his legislative failures, particularly over Obamacare. But on helping business, prioritising American jobs, immigration and saying it like it is he is their man. He is no Washington career politician, he is not part of the establishment, he is not just another Republican, and most important of all, he is not Hillary Clintonâ¦ and that is fine by them. :: Trump: We won't allow our cities to be threatened Watching the votes come in at HQ #election2016 #MAGA pic.twitter.com/0oixRl4RBj Oh, and they have also totally bought his assault on the mainstream media. Among Trump supporters here, everything that has gone wrong has been the media's fault. Now, of course, you may not expect much different from conservative voters in the rural Midwest. But the point about Wisconsin is, they are not the only people apparently content with the Trump presidency. In our swing through this swing state, where Mr Trump won by 0.7% of the vote, many business people and blue collar workers, who were tempted on balance to go for something different, are still relatively happy. Dairy is the big business here and we visited Ken Heiman, who has 500 head of cattle, and a big cheese factory in the heart of Wisconsin. He says he will put up with all the ""talk and the nonsense"" of the Trump circus if he delivers on helping business generate jobs. ""I'll deal with the talk if you can walk the walk,"" he says. ""If business is doing well and the economy is doing well - then I can deal with the talk."" It is a common refrain here and, of course, right now the American economy is doing pretty well. And these are the people - the people for who a vote for Mr Trump was a close call - who the President needs to keep on his side. You just have to look at the November vote to see how polarised things are in Wisconsin. Some 47.2% went for Trump against 46.5% who backed Hillary Clinton. And if it was a divided state then, the politics are deeply, unpleasantly toxic now. We met more than one person who said they no longer discuss politics at the dinner table or out with friends as it was all too stressful and nasty. The Trump presidency has certainly changed the tone of political discourse across America. His opponents think it is bad for democracy, his supporters are happy their voices are being heard . Mr Trump's success in Wisconsin - and across America - has given birth to a resistance movement on the left. They operate online and in coffee shops and target congressmen and women whose policies they dislike. It is a political insurgency, called Indivisible, that exists outside the Democratic Party and is growing in number and strength. :: Sky Views: Are Democrats ready to beat Trump? In Wisconsin it has a significant constituency of those who detest Mr Trump and all he stands for. ""He's an ass, a jerk,"" says third generation farmer, Alan Treinen. And that pretty much sums up the view in much of urban Wisconsin, too. The question we wanted to answer is whether Trump would win an election were it held now - the polls suggest he would not. Most say his support is down to 40% in Wisconsin. But we found his core vote largely holding up and his wavering vote still giving him the benefit of the doubt. Whether this holds up in the other swing states is difficult to say. But what is clear to me is that even the growing controversy over the Trump campaign's links to Russia is not damaging his support in the Midwest. They don't seem to care. At least not yet. :: Special report: Russia - The Insiders If there is firm evidence of collusion with Vladimir Putin's regime then that may change. His base may well think my enemy's enemy is my friend - in other words anyone trying to help Trump beat Hillary is alright by them! But there are two key issues in all this. Donald Trump has to deliver, and he has not yet. If the economy stalls, jobs don't materialise and he sinks in the Washington swamp he so despises, he will not get a second term. And a huge proportion of people we spoke to say they voted for Mr Trump as the lesser of two evils. So if the Democrats produce a strong candidate in 2020 - and that is by no means certain as the party is in a bit of a mess - things will be very different. But in a year of unprecedented, mercurial, combative, often unedifying politics, Mr Trump is still in the White House . You may not like him, but if Wisconsin is anything to go by, and notwithstanding some extremely unlikely, fast tracked, impeachment, you cannot write him off yet. :: You can watch the Sky News special report Donald Trump - Making America great again here.:: You can watch more on the anniversary of Donald Trump's victory on World View at 9:30pm on Sky News"
2017-11-07,Emily Hunt has launched a campaign to crowdfund a rape prosecution - the first of its kind in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108205749/http://news.sky.com/story/in-her-own-words-emily-hunt-crowdfunding-for-justice-after-alleged-rape-11118199,"She claims she was drugged and raped at a hotel in May 2015, but after an investigation the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided there was ""insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction"". Now Ms Hunt, who has waived her anonymity, is now looking to raise Â£100,000 to pursue the case and then fund a second private prosecution for another victim. Writing for Sky News, she recalls her memories of the alleged rape and the obstacles she has faced. I was curled on my left side, cold and naked, covered up but shivering. What I remember most - probably because it's what I remember first - was the feeling of the bedspread against my bare skin. Insubstantial, both rough and soft at the same time, like raw silk. I was confused by its texture. It clearly wasn't mine. As my eyes blinked open I had no idea where I was. Worse, I had no idea who the man was that I saw at a glance, as I peered over my shoulder. He was fully clothed, languidly leaning against the headboard, watching TV. I had never seen him before. Something was very wrong. It occurred to me suddenly that I'd been drugged. I knew it completely in that moment. I didn't find out until two days later - when the police finally got around to telling me - that I had been raped. The police had me, my rapist and the hotel room immediately, and yet my case fell through every crack there was. As a result, since that day in May 2015, I've learned a lot about the criminal justice system in the UK. I've learned a lot about how and why rapists get away with it. I've learned a lot about how the system lets down victims over and over again. But I've also learned to stand up, both for myself and other victims. According to Rape Crisis England, around 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales every year. In the UK, under 15% of rapes are reported. And for those few reported rapes, the CPS gets a conviction 6 to 7% of the time. This is despite the fact that the CPS has itself proven that women very infrequently lie about rape. Ninety to 98% of the time, if a woman says she's been raped, she has been. In the UK, it's actually closer to 98%. So, most rapists don't go to jail, clearly. But it gets worse. It turns out that in an academic study - admittedly in the States but I expect the findings transfer across the Atlantic - the majority of uncaught rapists will rape again in their lives. On average that rapist will commit 5.8 rapes over the course of his life. When the CPS wrote to me and said that there wasn't a public interest in pursuing my rapist, they couldn't have been more wrong. It's not just justice for me that I need. I need justice for his statistically likely other victims. The ones he's already raped and the ones he will rape in the future. Luckily, here in the UK, we have the ability to do the job of the prosecutor. A private person can hire a barrister and bring a criminal case in court. It has the same bearing as if the CPS did it. It can result in jail time. Just as it should. But barristers are expensive - so I am launching a charity to crowdfund the private prosecution of the man who raped me and to help other victims who have been let down by a system that doesn't see rape as a prosecutable offence. The thing about crowdfunding is the crowd. And in this case I have genuinely had a lot of faith in humanity restored in the way that people have reached out to offer support, donations and advice. Suddenly, I am seeing my inbox full with names of men and women from all over the UK, chipping in Â£5, Â£10, Â£20, even a few Â£100 donations. This will help me have justice whilst simultaneously being able to support others who are unable to afford something as simple as a toxicology test. It's taken me a long time to get strong enough to do this. And there's a lot more left to be done. But I refuse to give up. And at this point I don't think the crowd would let me. They've got my back."

She has no memory of meeting the man, only waking up naked in bed next to him. Ms Hunt reported the incident to police and claims her alleged attacker admitted that sex had taken place. However, after an investigation the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided there was ""insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction"". Ms Hunt, from London, has described the police's toxicology report as ""flawed"" and claims there were ""deep problems"" with the investigation. Metropolitan Police insist their investigation was ""thorough"". The force said those who report a sexual offence are ""always provided with support"", although Ms Hunt says she did not receive a call from Victim Support until December 2015. One year on from being told nothing could be done, she has hired a barrister in the hope of pursuing a private prosecution and has launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay for it - the first of its kind in the UK. Ms Hunt is hoping to raise Â£100,000 to ""pursue her own rapist"" and also fund another private prosecution for another victim. She says she wants to ""make it clear to the CPS and everybody who is doing this that rape is now a prosecutable offence in the UK"". Citing figures from Rape Crisis England, she told Sky News: ""Under 15% of rapes in the UK are actually reported to the police and of that 15% we're getting single digit conviction rates. ""The CPS's own research has shown that if a woman says she's been raped, 98% of the time she has been. ""We're in a very difficult spot with that, we need to be doing better, and I think that I can help with that."" Her campaign has already raised more than Â£15,000."

Ms Patel apologised earlier this week but details of two further meetings have now emerged. It has also been reported Ms Patel visited the occupied Golan Heights during a trip to Israel in August, which would represent a breach of British diplomatic protocol. It has put the Prime Minister under new pressure to sack the Cabinet minister. A Government source told Sky News that Ms Patel's fate is ""not looking good"". Sky's Senior Political Correspondent Jason Farrell says her sacking is now ""very likely"". In fresh revelations, it is understood Ms Patel met Israel's public security minister Gilad Erdan in Parliament on 7 September and foreign ministry official Yuval Rotem in New York on 18 September. Theresa May was reportedly told about the New York meeting on Monday but only learned about the meeting with Mr Erdan on Tuesday. Downing Street sources denied reports Ms Patel was told not to reveal her meeting with Mr Rotem in a list she published earlier this week. They also denied the Prime Minister knew about a meeting between Ms Patel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu until last week. Posting on Twitter at the time of the 7 September meeting in Parliament, Mr Erdan revealed he and Ms Patel discussed how ""to advance UK-Israel development cooperation"". Ms Patel was already under scrutiny after she failed to inform either the Foreign Office or Downing Street about 12 meetings she held with top officials during a 13-day ""family holiday"" to Israel in August. When conducting official work overseas, ministers are supposed to tell the Foreign Office. Ms Patel's meetings included talks with Mr Netanyahu, a meeting Mrs May had no knowledge of for more than two months. The Witham MP missed a parliamentary grilling over the exposure of those meetings on Tuesday, when she caught a flight to Uganda for a Government visit. It was left to her junior minister Alistair Burt to explain how, on returning from her Israel trip, Ms Patel had proposed giving departmental cash to the Israeli army for aid programmes in the Golan Heights, which was ruled ""not appropriate"". All Ms Patel's meetings in Israel were arranged by Tory peer Lord Polak, the honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel, who also sat in on most of the meetings. Lord Polak is chairman of consultancy TWC Associates, whose clients include an Israeli defence company and technology firms. Ms Patel, who has been touted as a future Tory leader, was ordered to Downing Street on Monday when the Prime Minister reminded her of ministerial rules. The International Development Secretary also issued an apology and a clarification of her previous comments to a newspaper, which had sparked accusations she was trying to cover-up details of her Israel visit. Ms Patel's sacking or resignation would mark the second departure from Mrs May's Cabinet within the space of a week, after Sir Michael Fallon stood down amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female journalists. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is also under pressure after his comments about a British national imprisoned in Iran led to fears her sentence could be doubled. Meanwhile, Mrs May's deputy Damian Green is being investigated over allegations of improper conduct towards a female columnist, with officials also looking into claims ""extreme pornography"" was found on his parliamentary computers."

It brings to an end a dispute that began in April last year, resulting in a series of strikes that have caused disruption for commuters, students and other passengers. Aslef general secretary Mike Whelan said: ""After one-and-a-half years of industrial strife we wanted to find a way forward for our members who work on the railway in this region, for the passengers who use Southern trains, and for the businesses which depend on the service, as well as for the company, too.""

But Nick Brown, chief operating officer of Southern owners Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), said that passengers could now look forward to ""stability"" and a ""resilient and reliable service"". ""This dispute has been difficult for our passengers in particular and we are pleased that we can now move ahead and deliver stability by finally concluding this deal with Aslef,"" he said.

North Wales Police said officers were called to an address in Connah's Quay, Flintshire at about 11.30am on Tuesday, where Mr Sargeant's body was found. He is understood to have taken his own life, the Press Association reported, and police are not treating his death as suspicious. The Welsh Ambulance Service said they were called about half an hour before the police. Until last week, Mr Sargeant was Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children in the Welsh Government before being removed from his role and suspended by Labour. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones revealed he felt he had no choice but to order an investigation after being made aware of ""certain incidents"" with women allegedly involving Mr Sargeant. Mr Sargeant, who previously served in a number of other ministerial roles, had described the allegations as ""shocking and distressing"" but said the details of the claims had not been disclosed to him. He added he was looking forward to ""returning to Government once my name has been cleared"". Mr Sargeant's suspension came amid a sexual harassment scandal across all parties in British politics. I'm deeply shocked to hear of the terrible news about Carl Sargeant. My thoughts and profound sympathy are with his family and friends. Mr Sargeant was married to Bernie and they had two children, Lucy and Jack. He had lived in Connah's Quay, in his constituency, all his life. Before entering politics, the keen football fan worked at a chemical manufacturing plant and was a quality and environmental auditor and industrial firefighter. In a statement following his death, his family said: ""Carl was a much-loved husband, father and friend. ""He wasn't simply a part of our family. He was the glue that bound us together. He was the heart of our family. We loved him so very much. ""He was the most kind and caring husband, father, son and friend. We are devastated beyond words, and we know our grief will be shared by all those who knew and loved him. ""We are in shock and grief. We ask that our privacy is respected at this time."" Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter: ""My thoughts are with the friends and family of Carl Sargeant following his tragic death."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also described himself as ""shocked, horrified"" and ""deeply sympathetic"" to Mr Sargeant's family. Asked if there should be a change in the way allegations of impropriety are dealt with, Mr Corbyn added: ""All allegations must be examined and must be pursued. ""But there also has to be great pastoral care and support given to everybody involved in these accusations and also that will deal with them, all parties, as quickly as possible."" According to Sky sources, Mr Sargeant was receiving high level support from various parts of the Labour Party - both in Wales and Westminster - at the time of his death, with the purpose of checking on his well-being. Sky News understands this is standard procedure for those accused of inappropriate behaviour and that Kelvin Hopkins, the Luton North MP denying allegations of inappropriate behaviour, is also receiving support. Sky News also understands Mr Sargeant was aware of the nature of the allegations made against him. Carwyn Jones said: ""Carl was a friend as well as a colleague and I am shocked and deeply saddened by his death. ""He made a big contribution to Welsh public life and fought tirelessly for those he represented both as a minister and as a local Assembly Member. ""He will be a great loss both to our party and to the Senedd. My heartfelt sympathies are with his family at this difficult time."" The UK Government's Wales Secretary, Alun Cairns, said he was ""shocked and saddened by the tragic news"". Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""This is unspeakably sad news. Our Parliament has lost a stalwart, and many of us have lost a friend."" The Welsh Assembly suspended proceedings on Tuesday afternoon following the news."

Two women - aged 45 and 18 - were arrested at the same time but were released with no further action. The NCA has said the investigation was not linked to terrorism. At Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday, Randhawa, of Grove Lane in Wightwick, Wolverhampton, was found guilty of maliciously possessing an explosive substance with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury. He had previously pleaded guilty to attempting to import explosives and has been remanded in custody to be sentenced on 12 January. Tim Gregory, from the NCA, said: ""The explosive device Randhawa sought to purchase online had the potential to cause serious damage and kill many people if he had been successful in using it. ""He was not involved in an organised crime group or linked to terrorism, but is clearly an individual who poses a significant risk to the community. ""Identifying people like Randhawa - who seek to access illegal firearms and weapons - is a priority for the NCA and we will not stop in our efforts to make sure they are arrested and held accountable for their actions."""
2017-11-08,Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has promised that if he becomes chairman of Johnston Press he will champion the editorial independence of its newspapers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108233224/http://news.sky.com/story/alex-salmonds-newspaper-pledge-in-boardroom-bid-11118993,"The one-time SNP leader told Sky News Ian King Live: ""I don't think that quality newspapers should back individual political parties. ""They should champion causes and ideas of course, but not individual political parties."" The newspaper group, whose flagship title is The Scotsman, has agreed to a shareholder vote on the removal of two of its most senior directors. Venture capitalist Christen Ager-Hanssen, who owns 20% of the company, wants to install Mr Salmond as its new chairman. The Edinburgh-based newspaper championed the campaign for a Scottish Parliament, but backed a 'no' vote in the 2014 independence referendum. Meanwhile, successive rounds of cutbacks have prompted concerns about the quality of its journalism. Johnston Press, which also owns some 200 local newspapers including the Yorkshire Post and the national title the i, has seen its market value shrink from Â£1.6bn in 2005 to Â£15m. This month it reported a 7% decline in third-quarter revenues compared with the same time last year. Mr Agger-Hanssen and Mr Salmond believe that if their boardroom coup is successful they can make more money from digital advertising and have promised to invest in journalism. Mr Salmond said: ""If the shareholders back us, then Johnston Press will be taken in a new, exciting and positive direction, but if they don't then the current senior management will continue in their disastrous course of policy."" However, Frank O'Donnell, who became editor of The Scotsman in April, says the former Scottish First Minister's comments that his title has become irrelevant are ill-informed and ignorant. In a column for the newspaper he wrote: ""If I was searching for a top class after-dinner speaker, I would definitely give Alex Salmond a call. ""But the man to help steer newspapers through their most turbulent times for 200 years? Perhaps not."" Mr Salmond retorted that Mr O'Donnell was the first Scotsman editor in 35 years that he had not met. ""But I would probably say, if you can run a country, as I have, then you can probably run a company."" Sky News first reported earlier this month on the boardroom battle for control of Johnston Press. It declined to comment at the time on Mr Ager-Hanssen's demands. A source close to the media company pointed out that all of its board directors received the ""firm endorsement of shareholders at May's annual meeting, with over 99% of the vote"". This week, Johnston Press acknowledged a request for a shareholder vote from Mr Ager-Hanssen's Custos Group It said: ""The Johnston Press Board is consulting with its advisers and will update its shareholders with regard to the timing of the General Meeting in due course. ""Shareholders are advised to take no action at this time. Further announcements will be made as appropriate."" Johnston Press did not comment on the latest remarks from Mr Salmond."

She reportedly only made it as far as Nairobi, Kenya, before being told to return to the UK where she arrived on Wednesday afternoon for a meeting with the Prime Minister. In her resignation letter, Ms Patel said it had been a ""tremendous privilege"" to serve in Mrs May's Cabinet. ""I accept that in meeting with organisations and politicians during a private holiday in Israel my actions fell below the high standards that are expected of a Secretary of State,"" she said, adding that she acted with the ""best of intentions"". :: Timeline: Priti Patel's secret Israel meetings Ms Patel said she offers a ""fulsome apology to you and the Government for what has happened and offer my resignation."" She went on to say that she would continue to support the Prime Minister and the Government and ""stand up for the Conservative values of freedom, opportunity and aspiration."" In response to her letter of resignation, Mrs May told Ms Patel ""it is right that you have decided to resign and adhere to the high standards of transparency and openness that you have advocated"". ""As you know, the UK and Israel are close allies, and it is right that we should work closely together. But that must be done formally, and through official channels,"" she said. Ms Patel had been under scrutiny after failing to inform either the Foreign Office or Downing Street about 12 meetings she held with top officials during a 13-day ""family holiday"" to Israel in August. In fresh revelations, it is understood Ms Patel met Israel's public security minister Gilad Erdan in Parliament on 7 September and foreign ministry official Yuval Rotem in New York on 18 September. :: Will Priti Patel be the only one to leave Government? Mrs May was reportedly told about the New York meeting on Monday but only learned about the meeting with Mr Erdan on Tuesday. Downing Street sources denied reports Ms Patel was told not to reveal her meeting with Mr Rotem in a list she published earlier this week. Posting on Twitter at the time of the 7 September meeting in Parliament, Mr Erdan revealed he and Ms Patel discussed how ""to advance UK-Israel development cooperation"". When conducting official work overseas, ministers are supposed to tell the Foreign Office. Ms Patel's meetings included talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a meeting Mrs May had no knowledge of for more than two months. The Witham MP missed a parliamentary grilling over the exposure of those meetings on Tuesday, when she caught a flight to Uganda for a Government visit. It was left to her junior minister Alistair Burt to explain how, on returning from her Israel trip, Ms Patel had proposed giving departmental cash to the Israeli army for aid programmes in the Golan Heights, which was ruled ""not appropriate"". All Ms Patel's meetings in Israel were arranged by Tory peer Lord Polak, the honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel, who also sat in on most of the meetings. Lord Polak is chairman of consultancy TWC Associates, whose clients include an Israeli defence company and technology firms. Ms Patel, who had been touted as a future Tory leader, was ordered to Downing Street on Monday when the Prime Minister reminded her of ministerial rules - before information about further meetings emerged. Ms Patel's resignation marks the second departure from Mrs May's Cabinet within the space of a week, after Sir Michael Fallon stood down amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female journalists. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is also under pressure after his comments about a British national imprisoned in Iran led to fears her sentence could be doubled. Meanwhile, Mrs May's deputy Damian Green is being investigated over allegations of improper conduct towards a female columnist, with officials also looking into claims ""extreme pornography"" was found on his parliamentary computers. He denies the claims."
2017-11-08,"As the allegations keep coming thick and fast, the atmosphere in Westminster is febrile.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108233224/http://news.sky.com/story/sex-pest-scandal-engulfing-westminster-worse-than-expenses-11112503,"I've heard senior figures in both major parties warning darkly that this is worse than the expenses scandal which rocked British politics in 2009. It certainly has many similar elements - a oversight regime which was revealed to be not fit for purpose, a drip-drip of allegations turning into a flood, and the risk that all MPs will be tarred as sex pests due to the behaviour of a small number. :: Fallon quit after No 10 told of sex assault claim The veteran Conservative MP Gary Streeter hit an unwelcome nerve for many in his party when he warned on Twitter that this felt like the John Major years - ""no majority, no money, ripping ourselves apart over the EU. That lasted five years. Oh dear"". Twenty years later, there are fears in the party that yet again the Conservatives could again be riven apart on Europe and then destroyed by sleaze. It's hard to believe that this barely began a week ago, when it was reported in a newspaper that a Whatsapp group of female Parliamentary staff were sharing experiences about inappropriate behaviour. Within days the scandal had reached Theresa May's government with the trade minister Mark Garnier the first to be accused and defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday, the first scalp to be claimed. :: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline Few in the Conservative party now think his resignation will be the last, in a scandal which threatens to derail not just the reputation of politics, but the delicate Cabinet balance Mrs May relies on to keep her fragile administration together. That her key ally, the de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green is under investigation over claims by the writer Kate Maltby that he touched her knee and wrote her an inappropriate text message, will be a source of worry to No 10. Developments in the Labour party are if anything even more serious, with the allegation by activist Bex Bailey that she was raped by a senior party figure and advised against reporting it by party officials. NEC member Jasmin Beckett has told Sky News that more victims were waiting in the wings, and called on her party to help them come forward. Allegations have already resulted in the suspension of Corbyn ally Kelvin Hopkins, 76, over claims - stringently denied - that he inappropriately touched an activist 50 years his junior; and an investigation into Clive Lewis, who denies he groped a woman at the party's conference. Both men served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. In fact Mr Hopkins was promoted to shadow culture secretary last summer, months after the leader's office was made aware that he had been reprimanded for sending the activist a suggestive text message. The senior Labour MPs, as well as Mr Green, are adamant that the allegations are untrue, and Mr Lewis even accused his accuser of lying. There is deep anger in Westminster at the way these allegations are coming out because, at least in part as a result of the failure of the political parties' processes, victims are instead going public before due process can take place. A list of around 40 Conservative MPs compiled by party staff, and circulating on social media, has been blamed for muddying the waters between MPs having affairs or relationships with colleagues; along with unsubstantiated accusations of harassment. Some MPs on the list have already come out to denounce the claims as lies, such as the Penrith MP Rory Stewart, whose researcher has backed him up. But as both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn scramble to get a grip on the scandal, events are moving fast. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party on Friday night and serious allegations referred to the police, responded angrily that the media were told about his suspension before he was and that he was not aware of the claim. The Prime Minister has issued a new code of conduct and allegations hotline for all representatives of her party, and the Labour leader said an independent specialist organisation would be appointed to handle complaints in the future. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the ""dam has broken"" in Westminster, according to Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said it was time for the ""male-dominated professionsâ¦where the boys' own locker room culture has prevailed"" to clean up. Westminster is not a normal work environment. MPs hire their own staff - often plucked from thousands who want to work at the heart of politics - and those staff can expect a different work culture depending on whether their boss is a 30-year-old, who has come from a career in business, or a 70-year-old, who has been in politics for decades. Drinking and socialising in Parliament's bars, but also away on by-elections and party conferences, can be part and parcel. Few MPs doubt that this is a watershed moment for the behaviour of parliamentarians and how Westminster is scrutinised. It is hoped that higher standards of conduct will eventually result. But as with expenses, things could get a lot worse before they get better."

She has no memory of meeting the man, only waking up naked in bed next to him. Ms Hunt reported the incident to police and claims her alleged attacker admitted that sex had taken place. However, after an investigation the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided there was ""insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction"". Ms Hunt, from London, has described the police's toxicology report as ""flawed"" and claims there were ""deep problems"" with the investigation. Metropolitan Police insist their investigation was ""thorough"". The force said those who report a sexual offence are ""always provided with support"", although Ms Hunt says she did not receive a call from Victim Support until December 2015. One year on from being told nothing could be done, she has hired a barrister in the hope of pursuing a private prosecution and has launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay for it - the first of its kind in the UK. Ms Hunt is hoping to raise Â£100,000 to ""pursue her own rapist"" and also fund another private prosecution for another victim. She says she wants to ""make it clear to the CPS and everybody who is doing this that rape is now a prosecutable offence in the UK"". Citing figures from Rape Crisis England, she told Sky News: ""Under 15% of rapes in the UK are actually reported to the police and of that 15% we're getting single digit conviction rates. ""The CPS's own research has shown that if a woman says she's been raped, 98% of the time she has been. ""We're in a very difficult spot with that, we need to be doing better, and I think that I can help with that."" Her campaign has already raised more than Â£15,000."

He was taken to court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and on Wednesday, a judge at Maidstone County Court ruled such discrimination was unlawful. Mr Wilson was handed a three-year injunction, which means he is not allowed to stop tenants renting from him because of their race. If he does not comply, he could face a fine or jail for contempt of court. Regarded as one of Britain's biggest buy-to-let investors, Mr Wilson owns hundreds of properties in Kent. The Commission's chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said: ""We welcome this outlawing by the court of Mr Wilson's discriminatory letting policy. Our homes are fundamental to our private lives and to who we are. ""Denial of a home on the grounds of race or colour is abhorrent conduct we do not accept in today's society."" According to the Guardian, he represented himself in court on Wednesday, saying: ""All the local people here agree with me. It's perfectly legal not to buy a house because you think it smells of curry. ""If you are in Luton or Bedford, maybe that won't make a difference. But in Ashford and Maidstone, 99% of the population are not from India or Pakistan. ""The problem is that if you have a Â£250,000 mid-terrace house, the valuation drops by Â£50,000 if it smells of curry."" :: Landlord Fergus Wilson defends 'no coloured people' ban over curry In January, Mr Wilson also banned plumbers, single parents, people with children under the age of 18, and ""battered wives"" in the criteria sent to agencies representing his properties in January. Outside court he maintained there was a ""problem"" with people ""cooking curries"" in their homes. He said: ""It gets into the carpets, it gets into the walls. ""You'll find that most landlords think the same. I'm here because I said it."" He said the remarks were ""a bit of adolescent banter"", adding: ""The real issue here is nothing about right or wrong or whether it's lawful, it's really the investment strategy of new entrants to buy-to-let. ""Many of them will not purchase at all now. ""Because of what happened, because of that email being sent off, there will be people who will not be housed, people not buying buy-to-let properties, and the Government needs private investors to buy buy-to-let properties."""

Tensions between North Korea and its US-allied neighbours have been high due to the reclusive country's determination to pursue nuclear weapons. Mr Trump told the National Assembly in Seoul: ""The (North Korean) regime has interpreted America's past restraint as weakness. ""This would be a fatal miscalculation. ""This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past."" In a stern warning to Pyongyang, Mr Trump said: ""Do not underestimate us, do not try us. ""America does not seek conflict or confrontation, but we will never run from it. We will not permit America or our allies to be blackmailed or attacked."" :: Analysis: Tour of Asia to test Trump's diplomatic skills He added: ""The regime has pursued nuclear weapons with the deluded hope it could blackmail its way to the ultimate objective. ""And that objective we are not going to let it have. ""The North Korean regime has pursued its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in defiance of every assurance, agreement and commitment it has made to the United States and its allies. ""It has broken all of those commitments."" Mr Trump offered North Koreans a ""path towards a much better future"", having urged the regime to ""come to the table"" and ""make a deal"" over its nuclear programme. These were calls echoed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in when he joined Mr Trump for a news conference on Tuesday. The US President was forced to cancel an unannounced visit to the de-militarised zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea due to bad weather. The Marine One presidential helicopter left Seoul early on Wednesday and flew most of the way to the DMZ, but was forced to turn back just five minutes out due to fog. Mr Trump heads to China later, where he is expected to seek President Xi Jinping's commitment to exerting further pressure on North Korea. In his speech in Seoul, Mr Trump had singled out China, along with Russia, for its alliance with North Korea, saying: ""You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept."" He also referenced the visit came a year on from his victory in the US election, adding he would be ""celebrating"" the achievement with the South Korean people."

He was rescued by firefighters but never regained consciousness and West Midlands Police launched a murder inquiry following his death in the early hours of Tuesday. His daughter, Fiona Nicholls, said the family was in shock. She said: ""He was a fun-loving, funny man. ""He was retired but worked hard all his life."" Mr Nicholls leaves behind his partner, daughter, two brothers and nieces and nephews. His 50-year-old partner managed to escape from the fire by jumping from a first floor window. She sustained fractures to her lower limbs but is expected to recover from her injuries, police said. The fire started after a large ""commercial-sized"" firework designed for outdoor displays was placed inside their home and set alight. Mr Nicholls' house caught alight quickly, with the inside being gutted. Police said they believe the firework contained about 200 tubes of explosives and would have taken just two minutes to fully discharge. Det Insp Paul Joyce, leading the murder probe, said: ""We are going through lots of CCTV and developing some lines of enquiry from that.

2017-11-08,"One thing Marks and Spencer has been excellent at during recent years, whatever you think of it as a retailer, has been its ability to downplay City expectations ahead of publication of its results.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108233224/http://news.sky.com/story/how-will-ms-measure-up-as-changes-accelerate-11118775,"The latest were no exception. The market had been primed for half year pre-tax profits, on an underlying basis, of Â£200m. An outturn of Â£219.1m, then, came as a pleasant surprise to investors, even if it did represent a drop of 5.3% on the same period last year. There was another pleasant surprise in the clothing performance - long the Achilles heel for M&S. :: M&S signals more store closures in shake-up Total clothing and home sales during the most recent quarter were actually up 0.6% on the same period last year while, on a like-for-like basis (which measures sales in stores trading in the same format for the last year or more) they were down by a mere 0.1%. That was better than most M&S-watchers had been expecting. There are growing indications that the decline in clothing has been stemmed and Steve Rowe, the chief executive, could point to the fact that M&S has cut the number of sales in clothing and home from nine to four while also cutting back on promotions. That is showing up in further improvement in margins. That was the good - or, at least, the reasonably positive - news. More disappointing was the admission that like-for-like sales of food, undoubtedly the strongest card for M&S during the last decade, fell by 0.1% both during the latest quarter and during the first half of the year as a whole. Total food sales were up by 4.4%, reflecting new store openings, but Mr Rowe was warning ominously about the ""headwinds facing our food business"" having ""intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". Accordingly, while Mr Rowe insists ""investment returns remain high"", the company is reining back on expansion of its popular Simply Food chain. It is not difficult to detect the hand of Archie Norman, the new M&S chairman, in either this decision or in the departure of Helen Weir, the chief financial officer, whose exit was first reported last night by Sky's Mark Kleinman. Mr Norman, who succeeded the urbane former investment banker Robert Swannell in September, is a hard-driving turnaround expert still revered in the City for the way, a quarter of a century ago, he and Allan Leighton rescued Asda from collapse before selling it to Wal-Mart for Â£6.7bn in 1999. Most sector-watchers who know him reckon Mr Norman will be pushing the likeable Mr Rowe to accelerate the pace of change at M&S and in particular the speed at which the retailer brings down its costs. As M&S seeks to place greater emphasis on its digital sales, Mr Rowe had previously announced plans to close 30 of its larger stores, but insists now that was the ""minimum"" and that M&S would ""go faster"" in closing underperforming stores. The company confirmed that, by 2022, it will have 60 fewer stores than it did in 2016 - yet many will question whether it could not be reducing its space by more. By then, meanwhile, M&S aims to be making a third of its sales online. Other questions remain. One is over Mr Rowe's recent appointment of Jill McDonald as head of clothing and home. Ms McDonald is well-regarded, due to successful stints as managing director of McDonald's UK and as chief executive of Halfords, but some investors worry about her lack of specific experience in fashion, particularly as her appointment triggered the departure of the former head of clothing, Jo Jenkins. The concern is understandable. Fashion, particularly women's fashion, is the fulcrum of M&S. Get that right and absolutely everything else follows. Ever since the late Sir Richard Greenbury retired nearly 19 years ago, M&S has had a string of leaders - Peter Salsbury, Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes, Sir Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland - who have all grappled with trying to either stem decline or revive the group's fortunes. That said, in Mr Norman and Mr Rowe, M&S probably has as good a combination of chairman and chief executive as it could hope for in seeking to achieve the latter. In Mr Norman, it has someone who will agitate for rapid and even radical change, but who also boasts experience of transforming a low-growth retailer into a high-growth one. In Mr Rowe, meanwhile, it has someone who has spent almost his entire career at M&S, who is steeped in its values, who loves the business, who understands its staff and customers and who can use that as potent weapons in driving change. As demonstrated by the warm response to its Christmas advertisements featuring Paddington Bear, there is still massive public goodwill towards M&S, probably greater than any other retailer enjoys with the possible exception of John Lewis. That is a fabulous platform on which to build."

It will see the two firms merge their household energy supply and services businesses in the UK, creating a new firm that would be listed in London. SSE would hold 65.6% of the stock in the new entity under the plans. The pair, which revealed advanced discussions on a deal earlier this week, hope shareholder approval will be completed by next summer. A tie-up would consolidate SSE as the country's second-largest supplier of household energy behind Centrica-owned British Gas, with a combined customer base of more than 11 million customers. :: Tie-up plans as firms face customer exodus SSE said it would help them compete in a ""competitive and regulatory environment"" as well as realise efficiency savings. The industry is under pressure to scrap controversial standard variable tariffs, which were described as a ""rip-off"" by the Prime Minister and which are often the most expensive in the market. The default rates are currently paid by almost half of UK households, despite a pick-up in switching rates. News that a merger between SSE and loss-making npower had been agreed was made as the former announced a 40% drop in pre-tax profits to Â£402m - blaming higher investment costs. SSE boss Alistair Phillips-Davies said: ""The scale of change in the energy market means we believe a separation of our household energy and services business and the proposed merger with npower will enable both entities to focus more acutely on pursuing their own dedicated strategies, and will ultimately better serve customers, employees and other stakeholders."" Competition concerns would be likely to dominate any regulatory investigation, though the industry insists it is currently healthy with 60 suppliers now challenging for business. An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""Our role is to represent the interest of consumers. It is not part of our jurisdiction to decide on a merger. ""However, we would advise relevant authorities if we were concerned that a merger would not be in consumers' interests."""
2017-11-08,A fugitive on Europe's most wanted list is fighting extradition to Croatia after handing himself in to British police over an alleged Â£127m fraud.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108233224/http://news.sky.com/story/fugitive-ivica-todoric-one-of-europes-most-wanted-hands-himself-in-to-uk-police-11117692,"Ivica Todoric said he would fight being sent back to face charges related to an alleged â¬110m (Â£97.3m) fraud at his heavily indebted family business, Agrokor. The 66-year-old was the owner of the food and retail group, which is Croatia's largest privately owned company, before it was put into state administration in April. He handed himself in at London's Charing Cross police station just after 9am on Tuesday and was detained on a European arrest warrant issued by Croatia. Hours before, Croatian authorities informed their British counterparts of his exact location in London after tracing his telephone calls. He had been on Europol's most wanted list. The fugitive, whose net worth is â¬155m (Â£136.5m), was granted bail by a judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday afternoon. Prosecutor Benjamin Seifert, appearing for the Croatian authorities, told the court Todoric faces three charges in Croatia - false accounting, fraud by false representation and abuse of position. The court heard there is a global freeze on the millionaire's assets. Under his bail conditions, he has to provide security of Â£100,000, hand over his and his wife's passports, wear an electronic tag and report to police three times a week. ""The context in which I grant you bail is the knowledge that both in this country and throughout the world your assets are frozen and your ability to obtain money is limited,"" the judge said. Writing on his well-known blog, the millionaire denied any wrongdoing and accused top Croatian officials of plotting against him for political reasons. An audit performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of Agrokor's state-appointed management showed a net loss of 11bn kuna (Â£1.28bn) last year and 3.6bn kuna (Â£420m) in 2015. Agrokor's net worth for the two years was reduced by 22bn kuna (Â£2.6bn). Suppliers, bondholders and banks, including about Â£969m held by Russia's Sberbank, provided credit to Agrokor. Timothy Otty, Todoric's lawyer, told the court his client is an extremely successful businessman who founded the group, which has been in existence for 40 years. A full extradition hearing will take place in April 2018."

Her sister's name has not yet been revealed, but it is understood that she was born in England a few days ago. Sir Andy's grandmother, Shirley Erskine, of Dunblane, said it was ""lovely news"". She said: ""I'm delighted, of course. Another little great-granddaughter and hopefully another little playmate for big sister Sophia. ""It's nice to get some good news. We were told that everything is well."" It has been a busy few days for the Scot, who was in action against Roger Federer on Tuesday in an exhibition match at The Hydro in Glasgow. He was stepping up his recovery from a hip injury suffered in his shock Wimbledon quarter-final defeat to American Sam Querrey. The injury is expected to keep him sidelined until the end of the year and he has dropped to 16th in the world rankings. He is hoping to be fit in time for January's Australian Open, with the Brisbane International on 31 December also in his sights. He said: ""I hope I'm there. Things have been going pretty well so far in the rehab, but you just never know. You take each week as it comes."" Murray was all smiles for his charity match against Federer, having made the Swiss feel at home by treating him to a generous helping of ""Andy's Granny's Homemade Shortbread"". Federer took the court wearing a kilt and Murray sported a tartan hat, much to the approval of the 1,100 people in the crowd. Canât get a warmer welcome than this. Thanks @andy_murray ... is this your usual pre-match routine? ðª pic.twitter.com/mWntwqvDPA Murray is not a prolific Twitter user but did take to the platform to offer the Swiss further culinary advice. Responding to Federer's post about the shortbread, Murray tweeted: ""Yea that's a good start but try a deep fried Mars bar on top of that and you'll be properly ready."" The shortbread seemed to do just the trick for Federer, who won the match on a tie-break after both men won a set 6-3. Murray said: ""I felt pretty good, not perfect yet, but I'm going in the right direction."""

But Mr Justice Hayden said he was ""very concerned indeed"" for Elliana's safety. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham concluded in May taht Elliana would not be provided with the essential safety and security that she needed and was her right if she were to stay in the care of her mother. The judge said: ""In optimum circumstances, the mother's capacity to meet her daughter's needs was barely satisfactory. ""But, it is abundantly clear that under stress, perhaps not taking her anti-psychotic medicine, perhaps in the grip of auditory commands which are hallucinatory, she poses, despite her love for her daughter, a very real risk to her safety."" He said he hoped that putting the information into the public domain would aid the return of Elliana to ""circumstances where she is safe"". During court proceedings which were likely to result in the child being taken into care, her maternal grandmother, Sharon Shand, also known as Richards, took Elliana to Jamaica for a ""farewell final holiday"" so that they could spend time together. Mrs Shand says she handed Elliana over to Jessica on her return to the UK in September and does not know where they are now, but the judge says he has no doubt she is in contact with them. He said his assessment of the family is that Mrs Shand would not let her daughter, who also has severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and Elliana, out of her sight for a minute more than was necessary. ""I have utterly no doubt that she is in contact with her daughter and, almost certainly, her granddaughter."" The judge said Mrs Shand was unable to accept or acknowledge the ""very significant"" risk that her daughter posed to Elliana. He said it was clear that the woman had a warm and affectionate relationship with her daughter despite her difficulties, and that Mrs Shand was also very close to her. ""This is a very much loved little girl. In that she is immensely fortunate,"" he said, adding it was easy to see from Elliana's photo why Mrs Shand was so proud of her. ""She is a strikingly beautiful little girl,"" he said. The local authority's plan was for Elliana to stay within her family with her father's side."

They said the 49-year-old had not been informed of the detail of the allegations before he was found dead, meaning he was not afforded ""common courtesy, decency or natural justice"". They also said warnings had been made about Mr Sargeant's ""mental welfare"" before his death on Tuesday, which is not being treated as suspicious. Until last week, the married father-of-two was Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children in the Welsh Government before being removed from his role and suspended by Labour. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones revealed he felt he had no choice but to order an investigation after being made aware of ""certain incidents"" with women allegedly involving Mr Sargeant. According to a letter sent to the Labour Party on Monday, Mr Sargeant's solicitor Hugh Bowden had demanded immediate details of the allegations, along with the names of complainants and information on how the complaints were first made and initially investigated. The correspondence revealed there was an anticipated hearing date of 16 January, while Mr Bowden added the ""ongoing delay"" of him being made aware of the detail of the allegations was ""both prejudicial to the preparation of our client's case but also to his physical and mental wellbeing"". An email sent by Mr Bowden to the party also expressed concern Mr Jones' comments to the media, in the wake of Mr Sargeant's suspension, were ""clearly prejudicing what is allegedly an independent enquiry"". The solicitor also warned about witnesses' evidence being ""manipulated"". On Wednesday, a family spokesman said: ""Up to the point of his tragic death on Tuesday morning Carl was not informed of any of the detail of the allegations against him, despite requests and warnings regarding his mental welfare. ""The correspondence also discloses the solicitor's concern that media appearances by the First Minister on Monday were prejudicing the inquiry. ""The family wish to disclose the fact that Carl maintained his innocence and he categorically denied any wrongdoing. ""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" Mr Sargeant's former colleague Jenny Rathbone, the Cardiff Central AM, has also raised concerns about the handling of the allegations. She said: ""It is a basic fairness that you have got to know what the accusations are against you in order to be able to respond but that doesn't mean to say we don't need to take allegations seriously, we obviously do. ""Other people say that even yesterday morning he did not know what the allegations were. ""It must have been devastating for him in the last few days. He was front page headlines for all the wrong reasons. It is all very tragic."" Neil Hamilton, the leader of UKIP Wales, has called on Mr Jones to resign over his treatment of Mr Sargeant. A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""Following allegations brought to the attention of Welsh Labour by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, an investigation was launched by the UK Party.""The Labour Party Governance and Legal Unit spoke with Carl Sargeant and, in line with agreed procedure, outlined the nature of the allegations that had been received and how the complaints process works."""

Shares in the FTSE 100 retailer were volatile in response to the news - contained within its half-year results. It opened more than 4% higher before going into reverse on the admission that trading had been ""difficult"" in October, but fought back to end the session 1.6% ahead. Underlying trading profits in the six months to 30 September were 5.3% down. M&S reported a fall in like-for-like sales in its traditionally strong food division and also its clothing and home operation - with sales coming in 0.1% down and 0.7% lower respectively. It said its food side had seen tougher competition and damage to profit margins from the Brexit-hit pound, with total revenue growth of 4.4% driven by 24 new food store openings. It said its embattled clothing arm, which has dragged on its financial performance for years, had done better in the second quarter thanks to a focus on improved products at lower prices. Nevertheless, it announced plans to shut more clothing stores in areas where they were less profitable. M&S did not give any details but signalled that any job losses would be minimal as its first 30 UK clothing store closures, announced a year ago as part of chief executive Steve Rowe's drive to bolster profitability, had seen staff affected mostly being redeployed. Mr Rowe said on Wednesday: ""We have made good progress in remedying the immediate and burning issues at M&S I outlined last year."" He added: ""The business still has many structural issues to tackle as we embark on the next five years of our transformation, in the context of a very challenging retail and consumer environment. ""Today we are accelerating our plans to build a business with sustainable, profitable growth, making M&S special again."" M&S said that while it would slow openings of new food-only stores, it still planned to launch another 80 Simply Food shops over the current financial year. It also confirmed a story by Sky News on Tuesday that finance chief Helen Weir was leaving the business to pursue what it called a ""plural career"". Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said of the company's update: ""This is not a pretty set of results for M&S, which has seen its turnaround plan undermined by changing consumer shopping habits and a weaker pound. ""While the retailer can't carry the can for the knock-on effects of the Brexit vote, the prioritisation of online sales can only be seen as a pretty late arrival at the party."""
2017-11-08,"At the age of 15, Stephen Ross's face and life were shattered when an IRA bomb exploded at the war memorial in Enniskillen on Remembrance Sunday, 8 November 1987.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108233224/http://news.sky.com/story/enniskillen-bombing-survivor-i-was-shown-love-in-the-midst-of-hatred-11118030,"The bomb killed 12 people and injured 63 but what is remarkable is how Mr Ross and others have managed to put the pieces of their lives back together and to turn one of the most significant terrorist atrocities of 30 years of the Troubles into a message of hope and forgiveness for the future. Here he tells the story of his recovery: At the very time we stood remembering those who had died and who were badly injured in two world wars, both Catholic and Protestant, we did not expect to be numbered among them. It was a miracle that I survived, buried under a huge slab of concrete from the exploded building. I still remember the sound of screaming voices, the taste of concrete and blood, putting my hand in my mouth and most of my teeth had gone and not being able to feel my left leg. I was airlifted to a hospital in Londonderry where two sets of surgeons set about reconstructing my shattered face and left leg. Looking back, it showed me that there are forces of good at work; many more good people than those who planted the bomb and supported them. It was the prayers of other Christians and the letters I received in hospital that showed me love in the midst of hatred. I focused on getting better and not being angry. If I let anger take root in my life against God or against the people who support terrorism, it would ultimately consume me and affect me physically and emotionally. Eleven years later in August 1998, on the very hour of the very day I was married, the Omagh Bomb exploded, claiming 29 lives. So I am mindful of those who have to live with the loss of their father, sister, bother, son or daughter and injuries each day and with so many other tragic events from Northern Ireland's past. There will be a time for justice and answers to the questions of why we had to go through this experience this but I choose not to be discouraged by the fact that the victims of what happened in 1987 have experienced neither to date. I trust God who has forgiven me much and that enables me to forgive and to move on."

The listeners to Gerry Bader's show on WIXX 101 in Green Bay- largely white, working class and angry - helped carry Donald Trump to the narrowest of victories a year ago. :: Donald Trump wins the White House: How election night unfolded And despite everything that has happened over the first 12 months of this presidency, they would vote for him again now. ""He's fighting for us, he's on our side"", ""He kicking ISIS' butt out there"", ""He's our guy, he's doing a great job"". Caller after caller was standing by their man and urging others to do so. Yes, they do not like his Twitter rants, they do not particularly want him to pick fights with war widows and they are not overly impressed with his legislative failures, particularly over Obamacare. But on helping business, prioritising American jobs, immigration and saying it like it is he is their man. He is no Washington career politician, he is not part of the establishment, he is not just another Republican, and most important of all, he is not Hillary Clintonâ¦ and that is fine by them. :: Trump: We won't allow our cities to be threatened Watching the votes come in at HQ #election2016 #MAGA pic.twitter.com/0oixRl4RBj Oh, and they have also totally bought his assault on the mainstream media. Among Trump supporters here, everything that has gone wrong has been the media's fault. Now, of course, you may not expect much different from conservative voters in the rural Midwest. But the point about Wisconsin is, they are not the only people apparently content with the Trump presidency. In our swing through this swing state, where Mr Trump won by 0.7% of the vote, many business people and blue collar workers, who were tempted on balance to go for something different, are still relatively happy. Dairy is the big business here and we visited Ken Heiman, who has 500 head of cattle, and a big cheese factory in the heart of Wisconsin. He says he will put up with all the ""talk and the nonsense"" of the Trump circus if he delivers on helping business generate jobs. ""I'll deal with the talk if you can walk the walk,"" he says. ""If business is doing well and the economy is doing well - then I can deal with the talk."" It is a common refrain here and, of course, right now the American economy is doing pretty well. And these are the people - the people for who a vote for Mr Trump was a close call - who the President needs to keep on his side. You just have to look at the November vote to see how polarised things are in Wisconsin. Some 47.2% went for Trump against 46.5% who backed Hillary Clinton. And if it was a divided state then, the politics are deeply, unpleasantly toxic now. We met more than one person who said they no longer discuss politics at the dinner table or out with friends as it was all too stressful and nasty. The Trump presidency has certainly changed the tone of political discourse across America. His opponents think it is bad for democracy, his supporters are happy their voices are being heard . Mr Trump's success in Wisconsin - and across America - has given birth to a resistance movement on the left. They operate online and in coffee shops and target congressmen and women whose policies they dislike. It is a political insurgency, called Indivisible, that exists outside the Democratic Party and is growing in number and strength. :: Sky Views: Are Democrats ready to beat Trump? In Wisconsin it has a significant constituency of those who detest Mr Trump and all he stands for. ""He's an ass, a jerk,"" says third generation farmer, Alan Treinen. And that pretty much sums up the view in much of urban Wisconsin, too. The question we wanted to answer is whether Trump would win an election were it held now - the polls suggest he would not. Most say his support is down to 40% in Wisconsin. But we found his core vote largely holding up and his wavering vote still giving him the benefit of the doubt. Whether this holds up in the other swing states is difficult to say. But what is clear to me is that even the growing controversy over the Trump campaign's links to Russia is not damaging his support in the Midwest. They don't seem to care. At least not yet. :: Special report: Russia - The Insiders If there is firm evidence of collusion with Vladimir Putin's regime then that may change. His base may well think my enemy's enemy is my friend - in other words anyone trying to help Trump beat Hillary is alright by them! But there are two key issues in all this. Donald Trump has to deliver, and he has not yet. If the economy stalls, jobs don't materialise and he sinks in the Washington swamp he so despises, he will not get a second term. And a huge proportion of people we spoke to say they voted for Mr Trump as the lesser of two evils. So if the Democrats produce a strong candidate in 2020 - and that is by no means certain as the party is in a bit of a mess - things will be very different. But in a year of unprecedented, mercurial, combative, often unedifying politics, Mr Trump is still in the White House . You may not like him, but if Wisconsin is anything to go by, and notwithstanding some extremely unlikely, fast tracked, impeachment, you cannot write him off yet. :: You can watch the Sky News special report Donald Trump - Making America great again here.:: You can watch more on the anniversary of Donald Trump's victory on World View at 9:30pm on Sky News"

2017-11-08,Emily Hunt has launched a campaign to crowdfund a rape prosecution - the first of its kind in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108233224/http://news.sky.com/story/in-her-own-words-emily-hunt-crowdfunding-for-justice-after-alleged-rape-11118199,"She claims she was drugged and raped at a hotel in May 2015, but after an investigation the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided there was ""insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction"". Now Ms Hunt, who has waived her anonymity, is now looking to raise Â£100,000 to pursue the case and then fund a second private prosecution for another victim. Writing for Sky News, she recalls her memories of the alleged rape and the obstacles she has faced. I was curled on my left side, cold and naked, covered up but shivering. What I remember most - probably because it's what I remember first - was the feeling of the bedspread against my bare skin. Insubstantial, both rough and soft at the same time, like raw silk. I was confused by its texture. It clearly wasn't mine. As my eyes blinked open I had no idea where I was. Worse, I had no idea who the man was that I saw at a glance, as I peered over my shoulder. He was fully clothed, languidly leaning against the headboard, watching TV. I had never seen him before. Something was very wrong. It occurred to me suddenly that I'd been drugged. I knew it completely in that moment. I didn't find out until two days later - when the police finally got around to telling me - that I had been raped. The police had me, my rapist and the hotel room immediately, and yet my case fell through every crack there was. As a result, since that day in May 2015, I've learned a lot about the criminal justice system in the UK. I've learned a lot about how and why rapists get away with it. I've learned a lot about how the system lets down victims over and over again. But I've also learned to stand up, both for myself and other victims. According to Rape Crisis England, around 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales every year. In the UK, under 15% of rapes are reported. And for those few reported rapes, the CPS gets a conviction 6 to 7% of the time. This is despite the fact that the CPS has itself proven that women very infrequently lie about rape. Ninety to 98% of the time, if a woman says she's been raped, she has been. In the UK, it's actually closer to 98%. So, most rapists don't go to jail, clearly. But it gets worse. It turns out that in an academic study - admittedly in the States but I expect the findings transfer across the Atlantic - the majority of uncaught rapists will rape again in their lives. On average that rapist will commit 5.8 rapes over the course of his life. When the CPS wrote to me and said that there wasn't a public interest in pursuing my rapist, they couldn't have been more wrong. It's not just justice for me that I need. I need justice for his statistically likely other victims. The ones he's already raped and the ones he will rape in the future. Luckily, here in the UK, we have the ability to do the job of the prosecutor. A private person can hire a barrister and bring a criminal case in court. It has the same bearing as if the CPS did it. It can result in jail time. Just as it should. But barristers are expensive - so I am launching a charity to crowdfund the private prosecution of the man who raped me and to help other victims who have been let down by a system that doesn't see rape as a prosecutable offence. The thing about crowdfunding is the crowd. And in this case I have genuinely had a lot of faith in humanity restored in the way that people have reached out to offer support, donations and advice. Suddenly, I am seeing my inbox full with names of men and women from all over the UK, chipping in Â£5, Â£10, Â£20, even a few Â£100 donations. This will help me have justice whilst simultaneously being able to support others who are unable to afford something as simple as a toxicology test. It's taken me a long time to get strong enough to do this. And there's a lot more left to be done. But I refuse to give up. And at this point I don't think the crowd would let me. They've got my back."
2017-11-08,Marks & Spencer has been forced to defend its Christmas advert starring Paddington Bear after complaints it contains bad language.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108233224/http://news.sky.com/story/paddington-swear-marks-spencer-christmas-advert-raises-eyebrows-11118333,"In the 90-second ad, Paddington And The Christmas Visitor, the duffle coat-wearing bear unwittingly thwarts a burglar stealing presents on Christmas Eve. After forcing the thief to return the gifts, Paddington gives him a marmalade sandwich and receives a hug in return. But the response he gets from actor Mark Benton has been heard by some viewers as less than polite. Thirlwall 14 wrote on Instagram: ""Something doesn't sound right in this new M&S advert."" Rob Souza tweeted: ""I swear the burglar says ""F*** you little bear"" to @paddingtonbear."" As festive adverts jostle for attention, both on the screen and on social media, it is unlikely to be the sort of reaction the family-friendly retailer was hoping for. But a Marks & Spencer spokesperson told Sky News: ""He's saying, 'thank you little bear'. We think it's really clear. We wouldn't change the ad."" Vetran newsreader Angela Rippon also appears in the advert, with Paddington played by the actor who voices him in the current film, Ben Whishaw. John Lewis' much-anticipated Christmas advert is yet to be released, but a mysterious Twitter account named @UnderTheBed2017 has tweeted a video of what looks like a cute animal's eyes peeping out from the darkness."

She met supporters and those who have been helped by the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families (AFNCCF) at a reception before the dinner to celebrate the charity. The 35-year-old patron of the charity, who is pregnant with her third child, had been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe form of morning sickness. But in recent weeks Kate has stepped back out into the limelight and is now in her second trimester and due to give birth in April. The Duke and Duchess announced the pregnancy in September with Kensington Palace issuing a statement in which the Queen was said to be ""delighted"" with the news. It read: ""Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child. ""The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news. ""As with her previous two pregnancies, the Duchess is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum."" The Duchess gave birth to her first child Prince George in 2013 and her second child Princess Charlotte in 2015. Speaking of the event, Peter Fonagy, the chief executive of the Anna Freud Centre, said Kate was ""very interested in maternal mental health"". He said: ""One of the things that we are interested in is intervening as early as possible in children's lives to improve their chances of good mental health throughout life. ""She's particularly concerned that mothers' mental health plays a major role in this and that we are able to support mothers to support their children."""
2017-11-08,NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has warned five million people will be left waiting for treatment if the Government does not increase health service funding in the Budget.Â ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171108233224/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-waiting-lists-to-grow-to-5m-by-2021-says-health-chief-11118284,"Mr Stevens said failure to increase funding would add one million people to the waiting list by 2021. Speaking at the NHS Providers conference in Birmingham, Mr Stevens said: ""NHS England's assessment of the funding position is that the Budget for next year falls well short of what is needed to look after patients and their families at their time of greatest need. ""On current budget, the NHS will not be able to do everything that is asked of it. ""The NHS waiting list will grow to five million people by 2021. That is one million more people, equivalent to one in 10 of us, the highest number ever."" Mr Stevens said the NHS would not be able to deliver on mental health or cancer treatment targets, and that some elective treatments may have to be ""retrenched or rationed"". He said he was speaking out ahead of the Budget because the public had ""a right to know the consequences"" of the decisions the Chancellor will make. In a blunt, strikingly political message, he also called on the Government to make good on the Vote Leave promise to divert more money to the NHS. Vote Leave's bus carried the slogan: ""We send the EU Â£350 million a week... let's fund our NHS instead."" Mr Stevens said: ""The NHS wasn't on the ballot paper, but it was on the battle bus. Vote Leave for a better funded health service - Â£350m a week. ""Rather than our criticising these clear Brexit funding commitments to NHS patients - promises entered into by Cabinet ministers and by MPs - the public want to see them honoured. ""By the end of the NHS' next financial year - March 2019 - the United Kingdom will have left the European Union. ""Trust in democratic politics will not be strengthened if anyone now tries to argue: 'You voted Brexit, partly for a better funded health service. But precisely because of Brexit, you now can't have one.'"" The Â£350m figure was hugely controversial during the referendum campaign. It was based on Vote Leave's calculation of the amount of money Britain sends to Brussels each week, but the UK Statistical Authority challenged the figure and prominent Brexiteers, including International Trade Secretary Sir Liam Fox and then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, distanced themselves from the pledge following victory. Boris Johnson revived it in September, writing that ""it would be a fine thing, as a lot of us has have said, if a lot of that (Â£350m) went on the NHS""."

On Wednesday, the LAPD confirmed it had received the report and it was investigating. ""Officially the first formal report ever taken on any of my cases,"" Feldman tweeted. OFFICIALLY THE 1ST FORMAL REPORT EVER TAKEN ON ANY OF MY CASES, AS SBPD NEVER FOLLOWED UP BACK IN 1993, & HAS NO RECORD OF MY COMPLAINTS. The 1980s teen idol has vowed to expose at least six names of men involved in a ""paedophile ring"" which he claims operates in Hollywood and were responsible for abusing him and his late co-star Corey Haim almost 30 years ago. :: Former child actors reveal sexual abuse in Hollywood ""Right off the bat, I can name six names, one of them who is still very powerful today,"" Feldman said in a crowdfunding video posted in October. ""In a story that links all the way up to a studio - that connects paedophilia to one of the major studios,"" he added. Feldman, who started acting when he was three, has long claimed that both he and Haim were abused when they were underage, and that it led to Haim's drug abuse and subsequent death in 2010. The pair starred together in the film The Lost Boys, and became a TV sensation in the 1980s show The Two Coreys. Now, Feldman has launched a TRUTH campaign to fund a documentary produced, directed and distributed by him, in which he will reveal the names of his abusers. :: Hollywood sex abuse: Are the kids alright? The money, Feldman said, will be enough to cover the production and distribution of the film, but also to hire a legal team to protect him against possible lawsuits. ""I've been silenced my whole life but just over the past few days since I've made the announcement, I've been arrested, I had a near-death experience last night where I thought I was almost going to be killed,"" he said in the crowdfunding video. ""Two trucks came speeding at me at the same time on a crosswalk. And then several of my band members have decided to quit because they were fearing for their lives. ""I'm very alone, but I need to protect myself and I need to protect myself and my family. I need additional security and I need a legal team to help represent me so I can fulfil this mission."" It is unclear whether the US statute of limitations could affect possible prosecutions on Feldman's case, and the LAPD has said there is ""no further information at this time""."

The former minister for children and communities was found dead on Tuesday after being sacked and suspended by the Labour party. It is understood he took his own life. Mr Sargeant's family said he was not afforded ""common courtesy, decency or natural justice"" when reports first surfaced of ""certain incidents"". But speaking in Cardiff, Mr Jones defended his actions and hailed his former colleague as a ""force of nature"". ""Wales has lost a person of great warmth, ability and charisma,"" he said. ""These are the darkest days that any of us can remember in this institution - but they are darkest of all for the family."" Mr Jones called Mr Sargeant ""my friend"", and said the pair had never argued in 14 years of knowing each other. He added there was ""great hurt, anger and bewilderment"" over the events, and welcomed a ""legal process"" that would scrutinise his own actions. But the First Minister defied a call from Neil Hamilton, the leader of UKIP Wales, to resign. After his death, Mr Sargeant's family released correspondence showing he was facing allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". The 49-year-old, a married father of two, had denied the claims. According to a letter sent to Labour on Monday, Mr Sargeant's solicitor had demanded immediate details of the claims, along with the names of complainants. The correspondence revealed there was an anticipated hearing date of 16 January, while the solicitor added the ""ongoing delay"" of Mr Sargeant learning details of the allegations was ""both prejudicial to the preparation of our client's case but also to his physical and mental wellbeing"".

Threatening to re-open deep divisions between the two premiers, Mr Brown was visibly frustrated when he was read extracts of his old boss's book. He shook his head and said ""no"" upon hearing a quote from Mr Blair's 2010 autobiography, 'My Journey', which read: ""As with the Bank of England independence, the broad framework of the economy was set by me."" Mr Brown responded: ""I don't really want to get into that; the fact of the matter is that the plan for the Bank of England independence was actually drawn up by Ed Balls. ""And he did all this work on it in 1994 after putting it forward to me as a proposal."" He added the pair worked on the proposal for ""years - not weeks"", reflecting: ""It's all history now."" Mr Brown also used the interview with Sky News to heap praise on Jeremy Corbyn, calling him a ""phenomenon"". He backed the Labour leader on tuition fees and calling for the Universal Credit roll-out to be scrapped. ""He has managed to change the nature of political debate in this country,"" Mr Brown said. ""He ran an excellent campaign at the election."" The former PM also turned on Theresa May - saying the Government ""doesn't have direction"" and voiced concerns that the UK was ""losing its confidence"". But he candidly admitted there were ""possibly"" similarities between him and Mrs May over their presentation style. ""I'm the son of a Church of Scotland minister, she was the daughter of an Anglican clergyman,"" Mr Brown mused.

In a tweet, officers wrote: ""Sad to tell you that a dead Common #Dolphin was washed up on the foreshore at Wandsworth yesterday.

""There may be others so keep an eye out and report any sightings."" Robert Deaville, from the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme for the Zoological Society of London, said some of the photos of the dolphin circulating on social media appeared to show it had become caught in a ""man-made linear object"". The early findings of a post-mortem investigation show the dolphin was undernourished, probably relatively aged and missing some of its teeth. The report also showed its stomach was contracted, indicating it might not have been able to find food in the river. Impression marks around its torso may have been caused by contact with a floating line. Further tests will establish if the dolphin had an infection, and will help determine cause of death. Mr Deaville said: ""We have been doing this work for 27 years and we have only ever had 12 common dolphin strandings on the east coast. ""However it came to be in the Thames, it's an unusual occasion."" Although there have been no further dolphin sightings, Mr Deaville has not ruled out that more than one dolphin may have travelled into the Thames."

Local authorities referred 812 people to the programme, and 267 referrals over the 12-month period came from friends and family. This is the first time that the Home Office has published detailed statistics on the initiative, and its figures show more than 2,000 of those referred to Prevent were under the age of 15. They included a nine-year-old boy from west London who stood up in class and said he supported IS after watching execution videos following the Paris attacks. He was referred to Prevent when he was 10, and has since turned his life around. Young people deemed especially vulnerable to exploitation and grooming are passed on to experts within the police, local government and other organisations. They are then encouraged to take part in the voluntary Channel scheme, which is tasked with diverting them away from violence and terrorism. Security minister Ben Wallace told Sky News: ""The current terrorist threat uses the internet to groom people and seduce people into violence. Younger people live their whole life online and that's why you're seeing it there. ""What these early figures show is that over 350 people who were really potentially dangerous attackers, either from the far right or Islamist terrorist groups, have been diverted away from violence and potentially therefore not being a risk to you and me on the street."" An older referral to the scheme was a 47-year old man who had been an active member of far-right groups and was an ""avid collector"" of Nazi memorabilia and literature. He said he would likely be in prison if it had not been for the help he received from Prevent. Prevent's national policing lead, Simon Cole, said: ""Partners in the police and other public sectors are getting better at identifying appropriate referrals. ""But if we are to successfully stop vulnerable people from being drawn into violent extremism, then family members, friends and community leaders must come forward sooner to us with their concerns. ""As we have seen, catastrophic damage and suffering can be wreaked when radicalisation is given the chance to infect the vulnerable."" More up-to-date statistics published by the police earlier this year suggested the number of tip-offs had jumped following a series of terror attacks in the UK - including the Manchester bombing, attacks on Westminster and London Bridge, and outside Finsbury Park Mosque in north London. Last month, MI5 director general Andrew Parker said the scale of the terror threat facing the UK was ""at a scale and pace we've not seen before"". He added: ""Today there is more terrorist activity, coming at us more quickly, and it can be harder to detect."""
2017-11-09,A coroner has warned of the dangers of ski lifts after a British teenager died during a school trip to the French Alps.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/ski-lift-warning-after-death-of-british-teenager-kieran-brookes-11119152,"Kieran Brookes was strangled when his backpack became entangled in a ski lift in the Alpine resort of Chatel in February 2011. The 14-year-old, from Bovey Tracey, Devon, was suspended 50ft in the air for around four minutes before he was freed. Rescuers attempted to revive the Torquay Boys' Grammar School pupil, before he was taken to a hospital in Annecy, France, with a severe brain injury. He was transferred to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, where he died on 17 March, 2011. Two years ago, lift operator SAEM Sports et Tourisme a Chatel, was cleared of involuntary manslaughter by a French court. But lift supervisor Richard Cettour was convicted of the charge and given a six-month suspended prison sentence. The court heard Cettour was not at his post during the accident and was found not to have reacted to other skiers calling for him to hit the emergency stop button. John Tomalin, deputy coroner for Exeter and Greater Devon, recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing and said he will write a 'preventing future deaths' report to Devon County Council and Torbay Council to highlight the dangers of ski lifts. ""Kieran Brookes died as a result of unlawful killing because appropriate mechanisms were not in place to halt the ski lift in time,"" he said. ""There were inadequate and inconsistent warning signs about the dangers of wearing backpacks on chair lifts."" During the inquest in Exeter, teacher Charlotte Pittocho said she had not heard anyone tell skiers to remove rucksacks when getting on the ski lift. She said Kieran had got on the lift ahead of her, but she was not aware of a problem until the lift stopped and a siren went off. ""From where I was sat the boy had his back to me and he was continuing to struggle. ""I could see he was now unconscious and looked like a doll. At this point I was really upset and it was really traumatic to watch."" Fellow teacher Nina Shinner said if a member of a staff had been sat with Kieran, they would still have been unable to prevent the accident. ""You need an operator to stop a chair if there is an incident,"" she said. A post mortem examination found Kieran died from pneumonia as a result of a hypoxic systemic brain injury. After the inquest verdict, Kieran's parents said: ""We have been waiting for six years to finally hear answers to many difficult questions we have been grappling with over the tragic loss of our son. ""We hope that after today's verdict the stark warnings which have been heard, will finally be listened to and save another family from facing the same tragedy."""

It has sparked fears she could now have her five-year prison sentence doubled. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard told Sky News it was now important that Mr Johnson ""stands up very clearly for Nazanin and says she innocent"". He said: ""She's a British citizen. All these political games and lies are unacceptable. ""I think it's really important he stridently tries to visit her. If that means going down and knocking on the door of the prison, I think that would be helpful. ""I think it would be good for me to go with him. Partly so I get to see my family, but also so he is clearly standing alongside us as a family. That's what I've been asking from the Government all along."" Mr Ratcliffe said his wife - who had travelled to see her family in Iran when she was arrested - had been visited by relatives on Wednesday, before state television reported Mr Johnson's comments. ""Certainly, her family were distraught,"" he said. ""Who knows how she's feeling at the moment."" Despite Mr Johnson calling his Iranian counterpart earlier this week in a bid to clarify his comments, the country's state TV has since seized on the row. An Iranian news report on the case said: ""Boris Johnson's unintended confession confirming training some Iranian journalists by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a goof that the British government could not cover up. ""Some even are asking the foreign minister to resign."" It said Mr Johnson's remarks had ""voided all efforts by the British government and media... who said Zaghari had been in Iran for humanitarian work"". Asked about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case during a visit to the US, Mr Johnson told Sky News: ""We have some difficult consular cases in Iran and we are working on all of them."" Both Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband and her employers, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, deny the charity worker was teaching journalists in Iran, insisting she was on holiday with her baby daughter. She was detained while attempting to fly home to London in April 2016 On Tuesday, as he faced a bruising parliamentary grilling over the row, Mr Johnson insisted there was ""no doubt that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was on holiday in Iranâ¦ and that was the sole purpose of her visit"". He apologised if his comments had been ""taken out of context"" but denied any connection between Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's most recent court appearance and his remarks. Mr Johnson will travel to Iran before the end of the year, a trip in which he hopes to visit Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe in prison. Mr Ratcliffe has said he hopes to join Mr Johnson on the trip in an effort to release his wife before Christmas."

Instead, pay every man, woman and child a monthly stipend - whether they have a job or not, whether they're wealthy or not. In January this year, the Finnish Social Insurance Institute began its own basic income trial, the most advanced in the world. Across the country, 2,000 people received a letter through the post telling them they'd been randomly selected for the experiment. :: Will voters trust John McDonnell with UK economy? Ms Martinnen was one of them but her experience shows some of the tensions of introducing basic income, even in a limited form. She was unemployed when the trial began, but is well-educated and has savings. When the scheme began and she was featured on national news, she was living in a rich part of town - the Mayfair of Helsinki - on those savings and received hate mail from strangers. Since the experiment began, Martinnen has found work but she still gets the income. She says, though, that it lets her be more flexible than before. Her father has Alzheimer's and she can visit him often, she explains, sitting in the kitchen at her parents' house next to her mother and father; cheese and jams are spread on the table. ""With this â¬560 I can work as an entrepreneur. I have a foundation that gives me some work and then I can plan my work. ""So I can also take a week off to do volunteer work, do this campaigning for world hunger day. ""So there's value in other things you do - if there's just not enough work for everyone you have to figure out how to inspire people to be creative and do other kinds of stuff. ""Otherwise you will have a lot of different social problems that will be very expensive - more expensive than the basic income system."" The problems with UBI are mainly to do with the ""universal"" bit. First, can an experiment being run in a small Scandinavian nation really give useful results for bigger economies around the world? If it's universal, how much will that cost - and can we afford it? And does a universal approach really deal with the complexity of society? ""The cost of basic income will be more than the current system,"" says Anthony Painter, who leads the Action and Research Centre at the Royal Society of Arts in London. ""You can fold in a lot of the current elements of the welfare state and the tax system into a basic income. ""There will still need to be an additional sum on top of that - probably one to two per cent of GPD, which is significant."" Kate Bell, head of economic and social policy at the trade union TUC is less convinced. ""One of the big advantages of universal basic income could be that it's a simpler system - one payment whereas benefits are complex. ""But that's also one of the disadvantages - people's lives are quite complicated. With UBI, we haven't yet thought about how to deal with those complexities - the costs of housing or disability."" Does a universal approach really deal with the complexity of society? We might found out soon - because UBI is coming to the UK. One Friday night in Fife, Scotland. A big man in a black-and-white leotard screams at the crowd: ""I hate your faces!"" They boo him back. The wrestler walks away from the ropes of the ring, bodyslams his opponent and the Kingdom Shopping Centre in Glenrothes goes wild. Fife Council is planning its own basic income trial. It wants to go further than Finland and apply it to an entire town, giving up to Â£7,000 to everyone - no matter their age or employment status. The idea gets a mixed reaction at the wrestling. ""I don't believe you should be given money for anything unless you're disabled or old - then, fair do's,"" says Stuart Lyons. Lee Robinson works at a fast-food restaurant which has introduced automated kiosks: ""It does take a lot of pressure off us at the tills but it does mean that a few people have lost their jobs"". Basic income is ""forward-looking - so long as people don't take the mick out of it"". Declan Erly, another wrestler, says: ""I think it's smashing you get the money but I think it's good in the meantime but you need to get jobs available - helpful until you get a job but not long term."" Fife Council is still in the design stage; it hopes to have a trial ready for 2019. Applying basic income to a whole town - called a saturation site - lets you study its effects on an entire population and understand its net impact. Along with Glasgow, Edinburgh and Ayrshire councils, it has funding from the Scottish Government. ""This is a proper policy,"" says Paul Vaughan, Head of Communities & Neighbourhoods at Fife Council. ""It's different and new in terms of where British public policy is headed so it's going to create a lot of interest. ""We want to find out if you have an unconditional payment, what sort of jobs, what sort of activities are you prepared to do, what sort of further contribution would you make to society - because you don't have to worry about making ends meet. ""Therefore what are some of the behaviour changes you would see, what are the impacts on poverty? What impact it has on the freedom of individuals to do what matters to them and probably matter more to society."" UBI has attracted praise from both the political left and right, as well as across sectors; tech CEOs like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, and politicians like Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell are all interested. To its critics, UBI is hopelessly utopian and naÃ¯ve. Nearly half of all jobs in the US could be lost to machines taking over, according to researchers at Oxford University. In the UK, The Bank of England estimates that a third of jobs are at risk - about 15million in total. Even if those estimates are overblown, and robots do prove to be our friends rather than rivals, work is changing thanks to digitisation and globalisation. The gig economy - on-demand work for companies like Uber or Deliveroo - is a halfway house to full automation. Employment in the UK is high but wages remain depressed. The experiments into basic income being run around the world may well prove the critics right. But governments were caught flat-footed by the first wave of automation. Getting ahead of the next one - and getting some actual data on UBI - must be worthwhile."
2017-11-09,This was a resignation only in the sense that Priti Patel got to formally terminate her own stay as a minister on paper.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-mays-cabinet-cannot-continue-like-this-11119136,"There may have not been an Apprentice-style ""you're fired"" moment in the six-minute meeting at Downing Street. But the PM's pre-drafted letter identifying ""further details"" withheld by Ms Patel during her dressing down on Monday over secret Israeli meetings was the key part of the PM's reply. There was disbelief that she had failed to disclosed two extra unofficial meetings with senior Israelis to Number 10. :: Timeline: Priti Patel's secret Israel meetings But it far from settles key issues and sets up a more fundamental divide with the Conservative Party. Allies of Ms Patel feel that the entire saga arose from an ""operation"" targeting the now departed Cabinet Minister for her pro-Brexit and pro-Israel views. Other senior Tories argue that she was caught ""red-handed"" on a Tory leadership push, that there is a ""corrupting"" influence aiming to alter UK policy on Middle East peace and that Ms Patel's host, the peer Lord Stewart Polak, should leave the party. In the middle are Conservative MPs deeply concerned that Ms Patel stepped well over a line in apparently visiting the Golan Heights, meeting the Israeli PM without authority and then lobbying for diverting UK aid to Israeli military humanitarian efforts in occupied territory. They lay some of the blame at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs who ""should have known"" that this would backfire. As it happens, DfID is likely to press on with some new forms of co-operation with Israeli Government humanitarian efforts in third countries where they have been judged to be effective, for example in Nepal. But the idea of providing UK money to any operations in occupied territories died almost as soon as Ms Patel floated it on her return from holiday. :: Will Priti Patel be the only one to leave Government? The wider Brexit dimension to this may well depend on who replaces Ms Patel. The PM will be anxious not to repeat the furore that greeted Gavin Williamson's ascent to Defence Secretary last week. But already influential Tories are urging the PM to forget about the ""Remain/Leave"" balance, and appoint a safe pair of hands such as Alistair Burt or Sir Alan Duncan. There is a bigger canvas here. Number 10 is keen that the PM is seen to have acted decisively in hauling Ms Patel back from Nairobi and all but firing her. But the glue of party discipline is already starting to loosen. If it was not already clear from the Brexit freelancing of the Foreign Secretary, we saw the incredible sight of the top NHS civil servant demanding billions, quoting Brexit slogans. Two hours later, Jeremy Hunt went into Number 10 ahead of a key Budget settlement before another expected winter crisis. Earlier in the week, five Tory MPs with no previous record of disloyalty signalled at a backbench debate that they felt the Government should be preparing an EEA/EFTA Single Market option for Brexit. None have yet signed any of the 400 amendments to be heard from next week to the EU Withdrawal Bill, so can be added to the 15 Tory MPs who have signed some, or the 10 who have signed a dozen amendments. If the Cabinet can say, do and advocate their own policy, it becomes rather difficult to force MPs to vote for policies they were willing to tolerate but still always believed were damaging to their constituents and to the country. The genie might well be out of the bottle now. For a variety of reasons - from sexual misconduct claims, to Brexit compromises, to general incompetence, and Budget unhappiness - it would be more surprising than not if there were no more ministerial resignations this month. The real business of Government, passing Brexit Bills and Budgets resumes over the next fortnight. It was difficult enough without self inflicted wounds. How much longer can things go on like this?"
2017-11-09,Germany players will join England in wearing black armbands sporting poppies for their friendly at Wembley on Friday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/england-and-germany-players-to-wear-black-armbands-with-poppies-for-friendly-at-wembley-11119232,"The show of remembrance comes just a few weeks after governing body FIFA changed its rules regarding what can be displayed on kits, having fined England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland last year for displaying poppies to commemorate Armistice Day. FIFA had considered the poppy to be a political symbol. It sparked outrage across the country, with even Prime Minister Theresa May wading into the row. But now teams can wear poppies, so long as their opponents and the organisers of the fixture agree. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will seek permission to display the poppy on armbands for fixtures in the week leading up to and including Remembrance Sunday each year. Reinhard Grindel, president of the German Football Association, said: ""I positively welcome the decision to allow both the English and the German national teams to wear poppy armbands, because these are not about political propaganda in any way. ""They're about remembering the kind of values that were kicked to the ground in two world wars but are cherished by football: respect, tolerance, and humanity."" English FA chief executive Martin Glenn added: ""Remembering and commemorating the men and women who have served this country is ingrained in our nation. ""Many have made the ultimate sacrifice and we will be honouring them, both on and off the pitch, for our match against Germany. ""I would like to thank the German FA for also agreeing to wear the poppy for the match, in a show of solidarity and unity at this important time."" RAF, Army and Navy representatives will lay wreaths before the 8pm kick-off and there will also be a minute's silence after the national anthems, during which the arch above the stadium will glow red and ""Football Remembers"" will be displayed on the big screen. Poppy sellers will be stationed inside and outside the ground and a replica of The Truce statue, which depicts the historic First World War ceasefire on Christmas Day in 1914, during which games of football broke out between English and German troops, will be on display beside the Bobby Moore statue. Friday night's match will also mark the first time video assistant referee (VAR) technology is used in an official game in the UK. It is designed to help officials make the correct calls on key incidents such as goals, red cards and penalties."

Ms Mordaunt, a Navy reservist, has had a long political career but a relatively short time in Parliament - only elected in 2010 and holding a handful of junior roles in the work and pensions, defence and communities departments. She used to work for former Tory leader William Hague, and was head of foreign press for George W Bush's presidential campaign in 2000. A savvy media operator, she sparked headlines in 2013 for a speech on animal welfare packed with innuendos - after losing a bet with fellow Royal Navy friends. The Portsmouth North MP told critics when the prank was revealed afterwards: ""If I have offended anyone, I'm sorry. Feel free to beat me up over it."" :: Westminster scandal: A growing problem for Theresa May She is a former magician's assistant and also featured in celebrity TV diving show 'Splash!' - donning a swimsuit to plunge from a diving board to raise Â£7,000 for her local lido in 2014. Unlike her predecessor - who suggested the international development department should be abolished before going on to head it - Ms Mordaunt is a strong supporter of the UK's foreign aid budget. She tweeted in 2014 that she would back a move binding the Government to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid. Ms Mordaunt was summoned to Downing Street on Thursday afternoon to learn of her promotion. She did not speak to reporters, but jumped into a ministerial car to be driven to her new department at the top of Whitehall. In Parliament today to vote for the international development bill. Commits us to spend 0.7% on aid. She was replaced as disability minister by Sarah Newton, a former junior minister in the Home Office. And in the first promotion of new Conservative MPs into the Government, Victoria Atkins became Ms Newton's replacement. It is the second mini-reshuffle in a week - after Ms Patel followed Sir Michael Fallon out of the Cabinet. But while some were angry about Ms Patel's departure, there is significantly less hostility to her replacement's appointment than Sir Michael's. Last week, the party was in uproar over Gavin Williamson being appointed Defence Secretary - with one minister telling Sky News the Prime Minister was ""so weak she's allowed the inexperienced chief whip to appoint himself""."
2017-11-09,Apple has said that the FBI is to blame after the bureau complained it was unable to access the smartphone of Texas gunman Devin Kelley.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/fbi-missed-48-hour-window-to-unlock-texas-gunmans-iphone-11119281,"The California-based company alleged that the FBI did not accept its help to unlock the killer's phone during a ""critical"" 48-hour window after the attack. Sunday's mass shooting at a church in Texas killed 26 worshippers - including nine members of the same family. FBI special agent Christopher Combs, who is leading the investigation into the gunman, claimed that the agency has been unable to access an encrypted phone belonging to Kelley. He said the inability to access the device highlighted ""an issue that you have all heard about before"" - alluding to an argument between the FBI and Apple following on from a mass shooting in San Bernadino. Mr Combs said he would not mention the make of Kelley's phone specifically as he did not want to ""tell every bad guy out there what phone to buy"", although it has been widely reported to be an iPhone. The FBI ultimately paid more than $1m to a non-government party to hack into the phone of the San Bernadino shooter - with Apple subsequently facing criticism over the role its technology plays in protecting subjects of investigation. Apple disputed the FBI's account of the difficulties of accessing Kelley's phone - claiming its representatives reached out to the agency ""immediately"" in the aftermath of the attack but bureau operatives did not respond. According to Reuters, which cited sources familiar with the investigation, the FBI subsequently missed the opportunity to allow law enforcement to unlock Kelley's phone using his fingerprint. Once a 48-hour window passes, the fingerprint-unlocking mechanism is deactivated as part of an iPhone's security measures - meaning the user has to enter their passcode to unlock the device. If Kelley used iCloud storage, investigators may be able to request data by delivering a court order or a warrant to Apple. The tech giant has complied with such warrants in the past. It is not known whether the US Department of Justice wishes to repeat its protracted legal battle with Apple over the encryption of its devices."

The founder and chief test pilot of British tech company Gravity Industries reached a speed of 32.02mph on his third attempt at Lagoona Park in Reading. Then he mis-timed a turn and dropped into the lake. It mattered little by then, however, as he had already made history. Adjudicator Pravin Patel from Guinness World Records was on hand to make sure that Browning's speed was measured accurately over at least 100 metres. The ""Iron Man"" suit is made up of six kerosene-fuelled micro gas turbines, which each have 22kg of thrust. It is controlled solely by body movement so Browning had to practice core strength exercises before his record attempt so he was able to balance in the air. Mr Browning told Reuters: ""It's a very special moment every time we suit up, it's about 45 kilos so you really know your'e about to go and do something. ""As the engine starts fuelling up it starts to build, you can sense the energy. ""And the moment the ground leaves your feet and you're actually in the air, it's a pleasure and a joy."" Mr Browning's feat came as scores of other records were smashed as part of Guinness World Record Day. In the US, a Harlem Globetrotters player broke the record for the highest upward basketball shot - 15.26m or 50ft. And extreme gymnasts Giuliano and Fabio Anastasini did the most Risely flips in 30 seconds. The largest vegan cake was made in Sweden and the largest hula hoops were spun in Japan. Mr Browning's achievement has been a long time in the making and Sky News has followed his progress from training on a Salisbury farm to unveiling his invention in front of crowds in Canada."

Christopher Plummer is now being lined up to play the role of billionaire John Paul Getty, and all of Spacey's scenes are going to be reshot. The extraordinary measure came as fresh allegations were made against the American Beauty star, who has now been accused of plying a teenager with drinks and grabbing his genitals. Spacey has not been arrested or charged with any crime. Sony Pictures has also withdrawn the movie from the American Film Institutes (AFI) annual festival in Los Angeles, which is due to start on 16 November. All The Money In The World, which had finished post-production and was being trailed in cinemas and online, had been expected to open in the US on 22 December. Scott is reportedly planning to keep this release date - and the film's co-stars, Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams, are expected to be involved in the reshoots. Variety magazine reported that Spacey had been involved in about two weeks of filming, including several scenes in which he was the only actor on screen. Netflix says it will no longer be involved with Spacey's hit show House Of Cards and will not release a film in which he plays Gore Vidal. At the end of October, actor Anthony Rapp had accused Spacey of sexually assaulting him when he was 14. Since then, other allegations have surfaced, and the Oscar-winning star said he is seeking ""evaluation and treatment"". The latest allegations come from Heather Unruh, who said her ""star-struck"" son was bought ""drink after drink"" by the actor when he was at a bar in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in July 2016. ""Spacey stuck his hand inside my son's pants and grabbed his genitals,"" she claimed."

He was rescued by firefighters but never regained consciousness and West Midlands Police launched a murder inquiry following his death in the early hours of Tuesday. His daughter, Fiona Nicholls, said the family was in shock. She said: ""He was a fun-loving, funny man. ""He was retired but worked hard all his life."" Mr Nicholls leaves behind his partner, daughter, two brothers and nieces and nephews. His 50-year-old partner managed to escape from the fire by jumping from a first floor window. She sustained fractures to her lower limbs but is expected to recover from her injuries, police said. The fire started after a large ""commercial-sized"" firework designed for outdoor displays was placed inside their home and set alight. Mr Nicholls' house caught alight quickly, with the inside being gutted. Police said they believe the firework contained about 200 tubes of explosives and would have taken just two minutes to fully discharge. Det Insp Paul Joyce, leading the murder probe, said: ""We are going through lots of CCTV and developing some lines of enquiry from that. ""This would have been a large heavy firework that would have been difficult to carry some distance, so I would ask anyone who saw someone carrying a large box in the area last Thursday night to contact us.

Mr Kouebitra had been setting off fireworks in St George's Field in Croydon, south London, when he and his friends were chased by as many as eight men wearing balaclavas and brandishing weapons including screwdrivers, blades and baseball bats on October 31 2016. The 22-year-old was stabbed with a knife in his neck, chest and arm, and collapsed in a pool of blood in a garden. He was pronounced dead that evening. CCTV footage showed Mr Kouebitra backing away from an unidentified figure, who lunged at him with a large knife. Two of his friends were also badly hurt during the rampage, which lasted no more than a few minutes, with one victim needing 50 stitches after being stabbed in the stomach. Both Rose and the teenager were convicted of murder, as well as wounding with intent. Aaron Jackson, 26, of South Norwood, and Marcus Asemota, 23, of Bromley, were cleared of all charges. The teenager was on a tag at the time of Mr Kouebitra's murder, for his role in a plot to steal mopeds. His sensor showed police he did not return home on the night of the killing, and a blood splatter on his snood indicated he was close to the victim when he was stabbed. He had claimed he was dealing drugs in the park and had been in Mr Jackson's car when the trouble broke out. Rose told police he had been trick or treating, and then claimed had never left Mr Jackson's car. Mr Kouebitra's parents, brother and sister attended court during the trial and quietly exclaimed ""yes"" as the teenager was found guilty of murder. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Price, of Scotland Yard, said: ""Scotty and his friends were not involved with gangs and it seems that they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, with devastating consequences. ""Tragedies like this are hard to comprehend and are totally devastating for the families of the victims."" The teenager and Rose will be sentenced on Wednesday."
2017-11-09,Donald Trump has managed to send a tweet from China - a country that bans Twitter and other foreign social networks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/trump-bypasses-great-firewall-to-send-tweet-in-china-11119367,"The US President addressed his latest message at about 6am UK time to his host, President Xi Jinping. Mr Trump wrote: ""President Xi, thank you for such an incredible welcome ceremony. It was a truly memorable and impressive display!"" He included a clip from ABC News of the ceremonial reception he received outside the Great Hall of the People and a link to an Instagram gallery with more photos. President Xi, thank you for such an incredible welcome ceremony. It was a truly memorable and impressive display! ð¸https://t.co/J9x51h1LBe pic.twitter.com/g4Z7mO5cV9 The President also changed his Twitter banner to a picture of him and President Xi and their wives Melania and Peng Liyuan surrounded by Chinese opera performers. There was much speculation before the visit to the third country on Mr Trump's 11-day Asian tour about whether he would use Twitter. Some wondered if he may stay off his primary medium for addressing his supporters out of respect for China's domestic ban. But the tweet prompted much discussion on China's state-sanctioned social media sites, like Weibo, with many asking how he was able to do something forbidden for Chinese citizens. ""I guess he must have done it via wifi on a satellite network,"" said one user. Many foreigners and overseas visitors attempt to get around the ban by using a virtual private network (VPN), which can sidestep the controls the Chinese authorities impose on the web. Without one, anyone attempting to access banned sites through China's own networks finds their attempt instantly blocked. But VPNs are heavily frowned upon in China, with a large department tasked with blocking access to most and laws in place that enable the authorities to arrest or fine those who use them and host them, according to the Cloudwards website. The massive state apparatus aimed at blocking overseas sites the authorities disapprove of has been dubbed the Great Firewall of China. What is more likely is that Mr Trump had access to a diplomatically secure satellite phone which could bypass domestic networks. The Chinese and US are presenting a united front during Mr Trump's visit, despite several potential points for conflict. Speaking at a business event, Mr Trump called on the Chinese President to put more pressure on North Korea. Mr Trump also criticised the ""very one-sided and unfair"" trade relationship between the two countries, but said he did not blame the country for having taken advantage. It came as the two countries signed more than $250bn (Â£190bn) in business deals in the space of a few hours. Theresa May was forced to delay a long-awaited trade mission to China in early October after Beijing chose to prioritise the visit by Mr Trump. After the bilateral trade meetings, China announced it would start a pilot scheme to relax restrictions on foreign firms' ownership of some businesses set up in free trade zones."

These trials involved 62,923 women, all of whom were diagnosed with the most common form of breast cancer - that fuelled by the hormone oestrogen - between 1976 and 2011. Each woman was given treatment such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for five years and by the end of that time, their cancer was gone. But their progress was monitored for years afterwards and it was found that more than 11,000 of them had their cancer return in a distant site, such as in bone, liver or lung, up to 15 years later. Women who had large tumours and whose cancer had spread to four or more lymph nodes had a 40% risk of the cancer coming back in a different part of the body over a period of 15 years after stopping treatment. Those who had small, low-grade tumours that had not spread had a 10% risk. The study, by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, an international team of investigators based at the University of Oxford, is published in the New England Journal of Medicine and funded by Cancer Research UK. Professor Arnie Purushotham, Cancer Research UK's senior clinical adviser, said: ""This research shows that stopping hormone treatment at five years leaves women with an ongoing risk of breast cancer coming back in the distant future. ""It's important to point out that since this research began, new drugs are being used to treat breast cancer, and these work in a different way to tamoxifen. ""It's vital that work continues to better predict which cancers might return. ""We also need to know what the difference for women might be in taking hormone therapies for 10 years instead of five, the side-effects and how this affects patients' quality of life."" Some patients stop their post-cancer treatment due to side effects that can include menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, joint pain or carpal tunnel syndrome. Professor Richard Gray, one of the lead authors from the University of Oxford, said that treatment has improved since many of the women were diagnosed so recurrence rates would be ""somewhat lower"" for today's patients. He added: ""This study does show, though, why women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer should at least consider taking anti-oestrogen therapy beyond five years and may also help motivate women who are experiencing side-effects to persist with treatment."""

He is expected to make a full recovery despite fracturing his spine and being rushed to hospital in a neck brace. Mr Cotton had travelled to Portugal for a surf retreat with friends in October, and decided to stay on for longer. He says he will return to the UK once he gets the go-ahead from doctors. He fractured his L2 spinal disc in his lower back, but says he's ""all right"" despite being in ""a bit of pain"". He told Sky News: ""I won't need surgery but it will take lots of time to heal. I have a body brace which will help me to move around."" Luckily, the ordeal has not put him off surfing, as he admits he is ""already thinking about getting back out there"". ""I've definitely never had a back experience in the sea,"" he said. The terrifying incident was captured on camera by a filmmaker who was making a documentary about record-breaking American surfer Garrett McNamara's return to big-wave surfing. Mr Cotton soon posted the video of the huge wave to his Instagram account, which is followed by more than 29,000 users. A post shared by Andrew Cotton (@andrew_cotty) on Nov 8, 2017 at 10:50am PST He wrote with the post: ""What can I say, I got a little excited this morning and ended up having possibly the worst wipeout impact-wise of my life. ""Thank you to all the lifeguards and crew on the beach who helped stabilise me and do a great spinal recovery, I can't name everyone but you all did your bit to get me safely to the hospital."" The traumatic crash has not deterred the surfer, who has vowed to get back in the water as soon as he is fit. ""I have broken my back but I've been really lucky, I'm already looking forward and focusing my energy to get fit and back out there on some more big rollers,"" he said."
2017-11-09,"Burberry is to close stores and stop its products being sold in areas it feels are not luxurious enough, as part of a drive to take its brand even further upmarket.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/burberry-to-go-more-up-market-and-shut-stores-in-luxury-push-11119247,"Shares tumbled after the change of direction was announced, just a week after the news that top designer Christopher Bailey - the man credited with creating its luxury focus - was to leave the business after 17 years. New chief executive Marco Gobbetti, who replaced Bailey in the top job earlier this year, said he wanted to focus on leather goods and fashion and cut sales to non-luxury stores, initially in the United States. The ""re-energising"" of Burberry's offering would then be rolled out to Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa, the company said. Investors were seemingly unimpressed - shying away from an investment strategy that risked hitting rewards in the shorter term. Shares opened almost 10% down on the FTSE 100. Burberry gave no detail on which or how many of its stores would close or how many jobs would be lost but it said the rationalisation programme - costing Â£15m - would mainly affect wholesale. The division, essentially outlets in department stores, currently makes up about 30% of the group's current sales. Burberry currently has UK branches in Edinburgh, Birmingham, Manchester (Exchange Square, New Cathedral Street and Trafford Centre) and London (Regent Street, Bond Street, Covent Garden, White City, Knightsbridge, Oxford Street Selfridges and Harrods). It also has stores at Heathrow Airport and outlets at Cheshire Oaks, Bicester and Chatham Place, Hackney. Mr Gobbetti, in a call with analysts, insisted his plan was not intended at shutting out customers through higher pricing. He told investors: ""Now is the right time for Burberry to implement the next phase of its transformation. ""By re-energising our product and customer experience to establish our position firmly in luxury, we will play in the most rewarding, enduring segment of the market. ""We have the foundations to build on and the team to execute our plans. This will enable us to drive sustainable growth and higher margins over time, whilst continuing to deliver attractive returns to shareholders."" The new focus was announced alongside Burberry's first-half results for the six months to 30 September, which beat market expectations. They showed a 4% rise in like-for-like sales with adjusted operating profits up 17% to Â£185m. Pre-tax profits were 26% up at Â£128m despite the weakness of the pound. The chain said that a benefit from tourist spending in the UK slowed in the second quarter."

Measuring somewhere between 85 metres and 100 metres in length, the letters were captured by national mapping agency Ordnance Survey. They can be seen from at least six kilometres away at the southern end of Brown Clee Hill. Ordnance Survey's Danny Hyam said: ""It is one of the most unusual ways of showing support for a team I've ever seen. ""Perhaps there is someone living in this area who supports Everton and has a back garden or bedroom window with a view of the hill and has a Liverpool supporting friend with an extreme sense of humour?"" The agency's flying unit sports a number of 196 megapixel cameras - more than 15 times the resolution of the camera on the new iPhone X - and takes more than 140,000 aerial images across the country every year. The sighting comes just a few days after the National Police Air Service tweeted a picture of the letters 'SUE x' etched into a field in Tetsworth, near Thame in Oxfordshire."

Sainsbury's reported a 1.6% rise in like-for-like sales over the period, excluding fuel, but the figures showed a big slowdown in the second quarter at just 0.6% - down from 2.3% in the first. Shares were down almost 3% in early trading. The company admitted shoppers were currently very ""value conscious"" but said customer growth in the period showed that efforts to tackle the challenge posed by discounters were bearing fruit ahead of the crucial Christmas trading period. Recent figures have shown the grocery sector largely escaping sales damage in wider retail - with those operating primarily in fashion facing strong headwinds from the Brexit-linked squeeze on household budgets. Next and M&S were two other big names reporting tougher times this month. Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said: ""We have delivered a good performance across the group in the last six months, with more customers choosing to shop at Sainsbury's in the first half than ever before."" He added: ""We continue to focus on offering our customers great value, supported by our removal of multibuys. ""Customers can shop at Sainsbury's knowing they get good value every day without having to wait for products to be on promotion. ""We are also collaborating with suppliers and working hard within our own business to reduce our costs and limit the impact of price inflation on our customers."""

But Mr Justice Hayden said he was ""very concerned indeed"" for Elliana's safety. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham concluded in May taht Elliana would not be provided with the essential safety and security that she needed and was her right if she were to stay in the care of her mother. The judge said: ""In optimum circumstances, the mother's capacity to meet her daughter's needs was barely satisfactory. ""But, it is abundantly clear that under stress, perhaps not taking her anti-psychotic medicine, perhaps in the grip of auditory commands which are hallucinatory, she poses, despite her love for her daughter, a very real risk to her safety."" He said he hoped that putting the information into the public domain would aid the return of Elliana to ""circumstances where she is safe"". During court proceedings which were likely to result in the child being taken into care, her maternal grandmother, Sharon Shand, also known as Richards, took Elliana to Jamaica for a ""farewell final holiday"" so that they could spend time together. Mrs Shand says she handed Elliana over to Jessica on her return to the UK in September and does not know where they are now, but the judge says he has no doubt she is in contact with them. He said his assessment of the family is that Mrs Shand would not let her daughter, who also has severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and Elliana, out of her sight for a minute more than was necessary. ""I have utterly no doubt that she is in contact with her daughter and, almost certainly, her granddaughter."" The judge said Mrs Shand was unable to accept or acknowledge the ""very significant"" risk that her daughter posed to Elliana. He said it was clear that the woman had a warm and affectionate relationship with her daughter despite her difficulties, and that Mrs Shand was also very close to her. ""This is a very much loved little girl. In that she is immensely fortunate,"" he said, adding it was easy to see from Elliana's photo why Mrs Shand was so proud of her. ""She is a strikingly beautiful little girl,"" he said. The local authority's plan was for Elliana to stay within her family with her father's side."
2017-11-09,The Chancellor is being urged to set aside an extra Â£1bn to retrofit tower blocks with sprinklers after the Grenfell tragedy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/corbyn-high-rise-tower-blocks-must-be-retrofitted-with-sprinklers-11119167,"Jeremy Corbyn will make the demand in a speech in London on Thursday, a fortnight before Philip Hammond delivers his Budget. Sky News understands housing is likely to be one of the key announcements by the Chancellor, with stamp duty reforms to help first time homebuyers. But Mr Corbyn claims only 2% of council and housing association tower blocks have sprinkler systems, despite research showing they ""extinguish or contain fires in 99% of cases"". ""The Government is failing to learn the lessons from this tragedy,"" he will argue. ""I urge the Chancellor to use the Budget to urgently provide the funds needed to retrofit sprinklers, ensuring people in thousands of tower blocks across our country are living in safety and with peace of mind. ""The Grenfell Tower fire was an entirely avoidable human disaster that must not be repeated."" Labour claims a number of local authorities have had their requests for funding from the Government to retrofit sprinklers turned down or ignored, including Nottingham City Council and Conservative-controlled Westminster Council. The sprinklers whould be fitted to all council and housing association tower blocks, starting with buildings that are 10 storeys or higher, the party will argue. Mr Corbyn will also hit out at ""staggering"" cuts to fire services in his speech. He will say: ""In the last seven years, 10,000 frontline firefighter jobs have gone - equivalent to one in six positions."" The Government has launched a public inquiry into the fire at Grenfell Tower, which left 80 people dead and over 70 injured. Sir Martin Moore-Bick will look at the ""response of central and local government in the aftermath"". However some survivors and families of victims claim the frame of reference of the inquiry is too narrow."
2017-11-09,"As the allegations keep coming thick and fast, the atmosphere in Westminster is febrile.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/sex-pest-scandal-engulfing-westminster-worse-than-expenses-11112503,"I've heard senior figures in both major parties warning darkly that this is worse than the expenses scandal which rocked British politics in 2009. It certainly has many similar elements - a oversight regime which was revealed to be not fit for purpose, a drip-drip of allegations turning into a flood, and the risk that all MPs will be tarred as sex pests due to the behaviour of a small number. :: Fallon quit after No 10 told of sex assault claim The veteran Conservative MP Gary Streeter hit an unwelcome nerve for many in his party when he warned on Twitter that this felt like the John Major years - ""no majority, no money, ripping ourselves apart over the EU. That lasted five years. Oh dear"". Twenty years later, there are fears in the party that yet again the Conservatives could again be riven apart on Europe and then destroyed by sleaze. It's hard to believe that this barely began a week ago, when it was reported in a newspaper that a Whatsapp group of female Parliamentary staff were sharing experiences about inappropriate behaviour. Within days the scandal had reached Theresa May's government with the trade minister Mark Garnier the first to be accused and defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday, the first scalp to be claimed. :: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline Few in the Conservative party now think his resignation will be the last, in a scandal which threatens to derail not just the reputation of politics, but the delicate Cabinet balance Mrs May relies on to keep her fragile administration together. That her key ally, the de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green is under investigation over claims by the writer Kate Maltby that he touched her knee and wrote her an inappropriate text message, will be a source of worry to No 10. Developments in the Labour party are if anything even more serious, with the allegation by activist Bex Bailey that she was raped by a senior party figure and advised against reporting it by party officials. NEC member Jasmin Beckett has told Sky News that more victims were waiting in the wings, and called on her party to help them come forward. Allegations have already resulted in the suspension of Corbyn ally Kelvin Hopkins, 76, over claims - stringently denied - that he inappropriately touched an activist 50 years his junior; and an investigation into Clive Lewis, who denies he groped a woman at the party's conference. Both men served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. In fact Mr Hopkins was promoted to shadow culture secretary last summer, months after the leader's office was made aware that he had been reprimanded for sending the activist a suggestive text message. The senior Labour MPs, as well as Mr Green, are adamant that the allegations are untrue, and Mr Lewis even accused his accuser of lying. There is deep anger in Westminster at the way these allegations are coming out because, at least in part as a result of the failure of the political parties' processes, victims are instead going public before due process can take place. A list of around 40 Conservative MPs compiled by party staff, and circulating on social media, has been blamed for muddying the waters between MPs having affairs or relationships with colleagues; along with unsubstantiated accusations of harassment. Some MPs on the list have already come out to denounce the claims as lies, such as the Penrith MP Rory Stewart, whose researcher has backed him up. But as both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn scramble to get a grip on the scandal, events are moving fast. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party on Friday night and serious allegations referred to the police, responded angrily that the media were told about his suspension before he was and that he was not aware of the claim. The Prime Minister has issued a new code of conduct and allegations hotline for all representatives of her party, and the Labour leader said an independent specialist organisation would be appointed to handle complaints in the future. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the ""dam has broken"" in Westminster, according to Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said it was time for the ""male-dominated professionsâ¦where the boys' own locker room culture has prevailed"" to clean up. Westminster is not a normal work environment. MPs hire their own staff - often plucked from thousands who want to work at the heart of politics - and those staff can expect a different work culture depending on whether their boss is a 30-year-old, who has come from a career in business, or a 70-year-old, who has been in politics for decades. Drinking and socialising in Parliament's bars, but also away on by-elections and party conferences, can be part and parcel. Few MPs doubt that this is a watershed moment for the behaviour of parliamentarians and how Westminster is scrutinised. It is hoped that higher standards of conduct will eventually result. But as with expenses, things could get a lot worse before they get better."
2017-11-09,"One thing Marks and Spencer has been excellent at during recent years, whatever you think of it as a retailer, has been its ability to downplay City expectations ahead of publication of its results.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171109215731/https://news.sky.com/story/how-will-ms-measure-up-as-changes-accelerate-11118775,"The latest were no exception. The market had been primed for half year pre-tax profits, on an underlying basis, of Â£200m. An outturn of Â£219.1m, then, came as a pleasant surprise to investors, even if it did represent a drop of 5.3% on the same period last year. There was another pleasant surprise in the clothing performance - long the Achilles heel for M&S. :: M&S signals more store closures in shake-up Total clothing and home sales during the most recent quarter were actually up 0.6% on the same period last year while, on a like-for-like basis (which measures sales in stores trading in the same format for the last year or more) they were down by a mere 0.1%. That was better than most M&S-watchers had been expecting. There are growing indications that the decline in clothing has been stemmed and Steve Rowe, the chief executive, could point to the fact that M&S has cut the number of sales in clothing and home from nine to four while also cutting back on promotions. That is showing up in further improvement in margins. That was the good - or, at least, the reasonably positive - news. More disappointing was the admission that like-for-like sales of food, undoubtedly the strongest card for M&S during the last decade, fell by 0.1% both during the latest quarter and during the first half of the year as a whole. Total food sales were up by 4.4%, reflecting new store openings, but Mr Rowe was warning ominously about the ""headwinds facing our food business"" having ""intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". Accordingly, while Mr Rowe insists ""investment returns remain high"", the company is reining back on expansion of its popular Simply Food chain. It is not difficult to detect the hand of Archie Norman, the new M&S chairman, in either this decision or in the departure of Helen Weir, the chief financial officer, whose exit was first reported last night by Sky's Mark Kleinman. Mr Norman, who succeeded the urbane former investment banker Robert Swannell in September, is a hard-driving turnaround expert still revered in the City for the way, a quarter of a century ago, he and Allan Leighton rescued Asda from collapse before selling it to Wal-Mart for Â£6.7bn in 1999. Most sector-watchers who know him reckon Mr Norman will be pushing the likeable Mr Rowe to accelerate the pace of change at M&S and in particular the speed at which the retailer brings down its costs. As M&S seeks to place greater emphasis on its digital sales, Mr Rowe had previously announced plans to close 30 of its larger stores, but insists now that was the ""minimum"" and that M&S would ""go faster"" in closing underperforming stores. The company confirmed that, by 2022, it will have 60 fewer stores than it did in 2016 - yet many will question whether it could not be reducing its space by more. By then, meanwhile, M&S aims to be making a third of its sales online. Other questions remain. One is over Mr Rowe's recent appointment of Jill McDonald as head of clothing and home. Ms McDonald is well-regarded, due to successful stints as managing director of McDonald's UK and as chief executive of Halfords, but some investors worry about her lack of specific experience in fashion, particularly as her appointment triggered the departure of the former head of clothing, Jo Jenkins. The concern is understandable. Fashion, particularly women's fashion, is the fulcrum of M&S. Get that right and absolutely everything else follows. Ever since the late Sir Richard Greenbury retired nearly 19 years ago, M&S has had a string of leaders - Peter Salsbury, Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes, Sir Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland - who have all grappled with trying to either stem decline or revive the group's fortunes. That said, in Mr Norman and Mr Rowe, M&S probably has as good a combination of chairman and chief executive as it could hope for in seeking to achieve the latter. In Mr Norman, it has someone who will agitate for rapid and even radical change, but who also boasts experience of transforming a low-growth retailer into a high-growth one. In Mr Rowe, meanwhile, it has someone who has spent almost his entire career at M&S, who is steeped in its values, who loves the business, who understands its staff and customers and who can use that as potent weapons in driving change. As demonstrated by the warm response to its Christmas advertisements featuring Paddington Bear, there is still massive public goodwill towards M&S, probably greater than any other retailer enjoys with the possible exception of John Lewis. That is a fabulous platform on which to build."

Asda is introducing the milk across 144 of its UK stores, stocking long-life bottles of Camelicous, a brand owned by the ruler of Dubai, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. With less fat and cholesterol than cow's milk, camel milk also boasts higher levels of vitamin C. It is also suitable for the lactose-intolerant, and often used abroad to feed malnourished children. Asda told Sky News: ""We always aim to make sure our range is a diverse as possible and camel milk is something a number of customers have been asking to see on shelf. ""We know Arabic nomadic groups have been drinking it for centuries, and we're excited that our customers can now enjoy the latest food trend - we think it's set to make a big splash."" Like cow's milk, camels only produce milk after they have given birth to a calf, but unlike cows who can produce up to 30 litres of milk per day they can only produce around six litres per day. Its limited rate of production and exotic origin is reflected in the price, with 235ml - less than half a pint - costing Â£2.85, more than 10 times the price of cow's milk. While the UK may just be catching on to the trend, camel's milk has been drunk for centuries in the Middle East. Flavoured varieties are popular in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, with ranges of butter, cheese and ice-cream also available. Reality star Kim Kardashian has even expressed her support of the product, after sampling camel milk during her 2012 visit to Bahrain."

Vaccination against HPV - which is thought to cause nearly all cervical cancers - has been offered to girls aged 11 to 13 since 2008. Professor Peter Sasieni, lead author of the study, said the finding could slash the amount of cervical screenings - saving the NHS time and money. He said: ""(Vaccinated) women are far less likely to develop cervical cancer so they don't need such stringent routine checking as those at a higher risk. ""This decision would free up resources for where they are needed most."" In December 2019, changes to cervical testing will be introduced in England. Under the new programme, cervical samples will tested for HPV but only checked for abnormal cells if the virus is found. Currently, samples are checked for abnormalities first, which experts say is less efficient. Plans to introduce this new HPV test are also being prepared for patients in Scotland and Wales. When the new test comes in, women who are not vaccinated should only need seven screenings over their lifetime, according to the QMUL study. Cancer Research UK's head of health information described the development as ""great news for women"". Dr Julie Sharp said: ""The cervical screening programme is already very successful, and has led to a dramatic fall in deaths from the disease since its introduction. ""While we hope to see these improvements to the screening programme in the future, it's important that women continue to take up invitations for cervical screening. ""So if you're all set for your next screen, keep that appointment."""

The fund - formerly known as the Guaranteed Low Risk Income Fund, Series 1 - was placed in liquidation in December 2012. The Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA's) inquiry found a series of failures including inadequate due diligence prior to CFM taking on the fund and a lack of oversight. It also identified poor communication - finding investors were ultimately misled. But the FCA said it had decided not to impose a fine as such a move would have meant customers losing out. It added that it had also taken into account that parent firm Capita - the FTSE 250 outsourcing specialist - was funding CFM's Â£66m payment to the FCA for the investor redress. Its shares were trading 2% lower on Friday. Capita had announced in its half-year results in September that it had made a Â£37m provision to cover the cost of any fine in the Connaught case. It is now believed to be planning the booking of a Â£29m charge to meet the Â£66m payout. The company said it had previously paid Â£18.5m following a claim brought by Connaught liquidators. It described the FCA's announcement as a ""full and final settlement"" and added that it had since disposed of its Asset Services businesses, including CFM, in a sale to the Link Group a week ago. It has been a tough few years for Capita - announcing in March that its chief executive Andy Parker was to leave in the wake of a series of profit warnings related to tough trading conditions and relegation from the FTSE 100. His replacement - former Amec Foster Wheeler boss Jon Lewis - is due to start work next month."

Mr Sandness had put a rifle below his chin and pulled the trigger in Wyoming in 2006, destroying most of his face. He withdrew from contact with other people after facial surgery left him severely disfigured - with a quarter-sized nose and a prosthetic nose, which subsequently fell off. But he was given hope when he made it onto a waiting list for the Mayo Clinic's face transplant programme in 2016 - and Mrs Ross agreed to donate her husband's face. Her husband, Calen, shot himself and died in southwestern Minnesota in 2016. The two men's ages, blood type, skin colour and facial structure were such a near-perfect match that Mr Sandness' surgeon, Dr Samir Mardini, said they could have been cousins. The successful surgery has allowed Mr Sandness to chew food properly again and helped him win promotion in his work as an oilfield electrician. Mrs Ross said she had been worried about the meeting bringing back reminders of her husband. But without the same eyes, forehead and strong cheeks, she was relieved to find Mr Sandness looked quite different. The pair wept as they hugged for the first time, and Mr Sandness spent time playing with Mr Ross' son Leonard. Mr Sandness said he had felt ""a lot of emotion"" at the meeting. He said: ""You're happy, at the same time you're sad because you know that they've lost somebody that meant a lot to them. ""So, I guess it's more of a relief than anything to finally get to know Lilly, meet Leonard and just thank them. ""All you can do is just prove to them that they made the right decision in the donation and just do your best and basically you have an obligation now to show them that this has given you everything you wanted with the donation."" Mrs Ross said: ""With meeting Andy, it has finally given me closure on how everything happened because it just, everything happened so fast and it was just it was hard. ""The thing that makes me most proud of how we went about with this is Leonard being able to see, when he gets older, being able to meet Andy and the other recipients, hopefully. ""And him being proud of what his dad did."""

As well as jail time, he was detained pending deportation as a foreign criminal, but on Friday won his claim for damages for false imprisonment relating to three instances totalling 445 days. They came after 2008, when he appealed a decision to deport him citing the deteriorating situation in Somalia, his home country. The European Court of Human Rights agreed he should not be removed from the UK. Mohammed said the periods of detention left him feeling ""trapped, humiliated and hopeless"". Mohammed also served two different four-year terms for armed robberies. The judge called him a ""violent and prolific offender"" and said the Home Secretary had not been able to deport him, despite his presence in Britain not being ""conducive to the public good"". After determining the fee, the judge admitted some would ask why a person who had ""abused the hospitality"" of a country should receive compensation. Deputy High Court Judge Edward Pepperall told the court: ""First, there are few principles more important in a civilised society than that no one should be deprived of their liberty without lawful authority. ""Secondly, it is essential that where a person is unlawfully imprisoned by the state that an independent judiciary should hold the executive to account. ""Thirdly, justice should be done to all people."" Mohammed was 13 years old when he was caught up in the outbreak of civil war in Somalia and was tortured by armed men, leading him to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. He mixed very quickly with ""bad company"" when he arrived in the UK, but Judge Pepperall said he was ""not the most wicked of men"". The judge said the breaches of procedure by the Home Office included not releasing him when there was evidence of torture, and when the prospect of deportation within a reasonable period was remote."

Luckily, ever-thoughtful Moz spots his sleepiness, and thanks to a cleverly chosen Christmas gift (purchased in John Lewis) he manages to solve his little friend's monster-induced insomnia. The ad is directed by Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind director Michel Gondry to the soundtrack of The Beatles' Golden Slumbers - and many on social media felt that its release marks the official arrival of Christmas. Twitter user Lee reacted to the heartwarming ad, writing: ""No no I'm fine.. I got something in my eye.. *after watching the john lewis advert*"". While Kathryn Louise wrote on Instagram: ""Thank goodness; a proper Christmas advert not seen from you guys since the snowman ad!! Love it"". Trust me, no one wants to know what's under my bed.  #UnderTheBed Others were less impressed with the offering, with Alice Westoby saying John Lewis had ""ripped off Where The Wild Things Are"". While Dave Corkery wrote: So let me get this straight... Boy meets monster. Monster befriends boy. Boy is tired. Monster commits suicide?"" Meanwhile, American Computer Science teacher John Lewis, whose Twitter bio helpfully states that he is ""not a retail store"" got in ahead of the advert launch, writing: ""Trust me, no one wants to know what's under my bed"". Earlier this week the launch of the Marks & Spencer Xmas ad raised eyebrows when some viewers thought they heard the F-word directed towards the hero of the ad - Paddington bear. Both retailers will be hoping to cash in on merchandising, with Moz and Paddington cuddly toys and the night light featured in the John Lewis ad all available for sale. John Lewis has already had to respond to complaints that the night light had sold out online, with a spokesperson for the store telling Sky News they are staggering release of the product online, but there is plenty of stock available in store."
2017-11-10,"Broadband and landline providers have agreed a new system of automatic compensation when customers suffer poor service, the telecoms regulator has announced.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171110222708/https://news.sky.com/story/broadband-providers-agree-new-automatic-compensation-system-11120625,"Ofcom said that issues such as slow repairs and missed appointments would result in money back from the company responsible, without it having to be claimed. It calculated the change would bolster levels of redress to customers - including many small businesses - by 900% because compensation was currently only paid in about one in seven cases. The watchdog's plan contains set compensation levels for certain failures. They include Â£25 for an engineer missing an appointment or failing to give 24 hours' notice of a cancellation, and Â£5 for each day missed through delays to a new contract. But Ofcom cautioned that it would be at least 15 months before the new rules could take effect as they meant that providers including BT, Sky - the owner of Sky News, Talk Talk and Virgin Media had to make ""significant changes"" to their billing systems. The regulator's consumer group director, Lindsey Fussell, said: ""Waiting too long for your landline or broadband to be fixed is frustrating enough, without having to fight for compensation. ""So providers will have to pay money back automatically, whenever repairs or installations don't happen on time, or an engineer doesn't turn up. ""People will get the money they deserve, while providers will want to work harder to improve their service."""
2017-11-10,Uber has lost an appeal against a landmark ruling on the employment rights of its drivers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171110222708/https://news.sky.com/story/uber-loses-appeal-over-workers-rights-court-ruling-11120723,"Two drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, won a case against the ride-hailing app last year after arguing they were workers and entitled to the minimum wage, sick pay, paid holiday and breaks. During its failed attempt to overturn the decision at the Employment Appeal Tribunal in London, Uber claimed the ruling could deprive drivers of the ""personal flexibility they value"". The company, which is also battling Transport for London over its licence to operate in the capital, said it would appeal against Friday's judgment. In a statement, it said: ""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed. ""The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal."" Mr Farrar, 49, said he was ""really disappointed"" over Uber's intention to appeal, adding it had ""an army of lawyers paid for by exploiting labour"". The driver added: ""We can't give up because the case law is so important now that if we give up and give this victory to Uber, then the battle will be so much harder for everybody else that comes after us - not just Uber drivers, but people right across the economy. ""Because if Uber gets away with this, then everywhere you turn in Britain, industrial Britain, you'll have people under this sort of fake self-employed conditions, carrying all the risk of the business with no worker rights."" Calling on Uber to ""throw in the towel"", TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""No company, however big or well-connected, is above the law. ""Uber must play by the rules and stop denying its drivers basic rights at work. This ruling should put gig economy employers on notice."" Last month, Uber filed an appeal against a decision by TfL to deny it a licence to operate in London. TfL said the taxi-hailing app had demonstrated ""a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications"". Uber employs 40,000 drivers in the capital and can continue to operate until that appeal process is complete. While some drivers have criticised Uber's structure, others say the app gives them the chance to work when they like. ""Every driver I know who uses the app does not want to be a worker for Uber,"" driver Ben Tino told Sky News. ""We want to remain independent - it's the reason why we all signed up in the first place."" He added: ""I really hope that Uber goes on to win this case otherwise it would be a disaster for the drivers who actually use the app. ""Uber has transformed the private hire industry for the better."""
2017-11-10,Sending Facebook staff our private sexual material in order to prevent that material being seen by strangers seems counter-intuitive.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171110222708/https://news.sky.com/story/will-facebook-make-a-hash-of-storing-nude-photos-11119346,"While the Government has strengthened the law to prosecute people who share another person's sexual images and videos without their consent, prosecution can only ever be a post-facto form of redress. Facebook is proactively trying to prevent the spread so-called revenge pornography by encouraging users to upload intimate material of themselves that they do not want to be shared. This material will not be simply digitally fingerprinted by Facebook's computers but actually viewed by humans at the company, potentially exposing victims to an additional violation of their privacy. A blurred copy of that image will be stored indefinitely by Facebook and kept on file for staff to consult when those algorithms fail to provide a clear answer. The company is running a pilot scheme in Australia, with plans to extend it to the UK, which will create a fingerprint of these intimate images and videos used to detect any attempts to share those files. Classically, such fingerprinting technology used cryptographic hash functions to identify the files by a short unique code which computers could easily use to automatically identify them. Unfortunately, the technology is very easy to fool. With cryptographic hash functions, even the smallest change to the input file will result in a completely different fingerprint as its output. Image files which have been manually manipulated to change a single pixel - or have simply been rotated or resized - might seem similar to the human eye, but would be completely unrecognisable to a computer. This makes it very possible for someone to share blocked images by deceiving the automated system meant to catch them. Here, obviously similar images of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg generate completely different hashes using the MD5 algorithm. Responding to criticism that Facebook's detection mechanism would be easy to fool, the company's chief security officer Alex Stamos told Twitter that Facebook was using a different fingerprinting technology. ""There are algorithms that can be used to create a fingerprint of a photo/video that is resilient to simple transforms like resizing,"" Mr Stamos wrote. ""I hate the term 'hash' because it implies cryptographic properties that are orthogonal to how these fingerprints work,"" he added. Facebook refused to explain what algorithms it was using, but Mr Stamos' description resembles something known as perceptual hashes, UCL security researcher Dr Steven Murdoch told Sky News. ""Perceptual hashes are still hashes, from the perspective that they are fixed size and generally much smaller than the input files. However they have very different security properties,"" Dr Murdoch explained. ""Using perceptual hashes does however mean that Facebook only have to store the perceptual hash in order to flag suspect images, and since it is infeasible to recreate the original image from the hash, it reduces the risk of the original image leaking out."" Unlike cryptographic hashes, perceptual hashes are able to detect the vast similarities between images which are not identical, foiling attempts to deceive the automated system. Where the MD5 hashes didn't reflect any similarity between the images, the perceptual hashes for these images generated with the open source pHash algorithm allows the computer to say they are 89% similar. Despite the potential privacy violation if users are unaware that Facebook staff may look at their intimate material, the ability to restrict how exposed that material could be may be an effective method of preventing the spread of revenge pornography. All images that are uploaded to Facebook are compared against a database of hashes of known unwanted content, from material showing child abuse to encouraging terrorism. However, it is necessary to subject new material to manual review by Facebook employees to prevent abuse of the system to censor content unrelated to revenge porn. While the initial view of an image by a member of Facebook's staff might mean that users' intimate photos might not be safe from Facebook, the perceptual hashing means they're probably safer with Facebook."
2017-11-10,"As the allegations keep coming thick and fast, the atmosphere in Westminster is febrile.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171110222708/https://news.sky.com/story/sex-pest-scandal-engulfing-westminster-worse-than-expenses-11112503,"I've heard senior figures in both major parties warning darkly that this is worse than the expenses scandal which rocked British politics in 2009. It certainly has many similar elements - a oversight regime which was revealed to be not fit for purpose, a drip-drip of allegations turning into a flood, and the risk that all MPs will be tarred as sex pests due to the behaviour of a small number. :: Fallon quit after No 10 told of sex assault claim The veteran Conservative MP Gary Streeter hit an unwelcome nerve for many in his party when he warned on Twitter that this felt like the John Major years - ""no majority, no money, ripping ourselves apart over the EU. That lasted five years. Oh dear"". Twenty years later, there are fears in the party that yet again the Conservatives could again be riven apart on Europe and then destroyed by sleaze. It's hard to believe that this barely began a week ago, when it was reported in a newspaper that a Whatsapp group of female Parliamentary staff were sharing experiences about inappropriate behaviour. Within days the scandal had reached Theresa May's government with the trade minister Mark Garnier the first to be accused and defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday, the first scalp to be claimed. :: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline Few in the Conservative party now think his resignation will be the last, in a scandal which threatens to derail not just the reputation of politics, but the delicate Cabinet balance Mrs May relies on to keep her fragile administration together. That her key ally, the de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green is under investigation over claims by the writer Kate Maltby that he touched her knee and wrote her an inappropriate text message, will be a source of worry to No 10. Developments in the Labour party are if anything even more serious, with the allegation by activist Bex Bailey that she was raped by a senior party figure and advised against reporting it by party officials. NEC member Jasmin Beckett has told Sky News that more victims were waiting in the wings, and called on her party to help them come forward. Allegations have already resulted in the suspension of Corbyn ally Kelvin Hopkins, 76, over claims - stringently denied - that he inappropriately touched an activist 50 years his junior; and an investigation into Clive Lewis, who denies he groped a woman at the party's conference. Both men served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. In fact Mr Hopkins was promoted to shadow culture secretary last summer, months after the leader's office was made aware that he had been reprimanded for sending the activist a suggestive text message. The senior Labour MPs, as well as Mr Green, are adamant that the allegations are untrue, and Mr Lewis even accused his accuser of lying. There is deep anger in Westminster at the way these allegations are coming out because, at least in part as a result of the failure of the political parties' processes, victims are instead going public before due process can take place. A list of around 40 Conservative MPs compiled by party staff, and circulating on social media, has been blamed for muddying the waters between MPs having affairs or relationships with colleagues; along with unsubstantiated accusations of harassment. Some MPs on the list have already come out to denounce the claims as lies, such as the Penrith MP Rory Stewart, whose researcher has backed him up. But as both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn scramble to get a grip on the scandal, events are moving fast. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party on Friday night and serious allegations referred to the police, responded angrily that the media were told about his suspension before he was and that he was not aware of the claim. The Prime Minister has issued a new code of conduct and allegations hotline for all representatives of her party, and the Labour leader said an independent specialist organisation would be appointed to handle complaints in the future. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the ""dam has broken"" in Westminster, according to Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said it was time for the ""male-dominated professionsâ¦where the boys' own locker room culture has prevailed"" to clean up. Westminster is not a normal work environment. MPs hire their own staff - often plucked from thousands who want to work at the heart of politics - and those staff can expect a different work culture depending on whether their boss is a 30-year-old, who has come from a career in business, or a 70-year-old, who has been in politics for decades. Drinking and socialising in Parliament's bars, but also away on by-elections and party conferences, can be part and parcel. Few MPs doubt that this is a watershed moment for the behaviour of parliamentarians and how Westminster is scrutinised. It is hoped that higher standards of conduct will eventually result. But as with expenses, things could get a lot worse before they get better."

Opening his defence case on Friday, his lawyer admitted he was a man driven by lust but reminded the jury he was innocent until proven guilty. Elizabeth Marsh said: ""Mr Cilliers is an easy target, no Prince Charming, if anything the pantomime villain, unfaithful, lying to each of the women in his life, as one assumes needs must if you are conducting any sort of affair. ""If it's the path you choose to tackle, honesty is not something that is possible once an affair has been embarked upon. ""He is something of a penniless scoundrel which is how he might be characterised - if only Victoria Cilliers had been tied to the train tracks with Mr Cilliers twirling his moustache. ""But we are not there, it's fantasy land and we have to look at the evidence."" She said his affairs did not mean he was lying about what he said happened to his wife. Ms Marsh told the jury he would not have stood to inherit any money from Mrs Cilliers, because of their prenuptial agreement. The barrister also said that parachuting is seen as an extreme sport, but was safer than ""driving, cycling or being a pedestrian"". Mrs Cilliers suffered near-fatal injuries after the jump at the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon, on 5 April, 2015. He is also accused of a second count of attempted murder, after allegedly tampering with the gas valve at their home a few days earlier and one count of criminal damage recklessly endangering life. The 37-year-old denies all the charges and the trial continues."

However, the family of Mr Sargeant, 49, said asking the Permanent Secretary to start preparations for a probe meant it would not be truly independent. In a statement they said: ""The inquiry must be established by a body that is fully independent of Welsh Government. ""The Permanent Secretary reports directly to the First Minister and is therefore not independent. ""We believe that a truly independent body must also be responsible for agreeing the terms of reference and appointing the chair and secretariat for the inquiry."" Mr Sargeant is believed to have killed himself four days after being suspended from the Labour Party and removed from his role as cabinet secretary for communities and children following claims of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". A spokesman for Mr Jones said: ""Further to the First Minister's comments yesterday about the need for independent scrutiny of his actions and decisions in relation to Carl Sargeant, he agrees that there should be an independent inquiry and it would be proper to ask a senior QC to lead that work. ""To ensure this happens separately from his office, the First Minister has asked the Permanent Secretary to begin preparatory work for this inquiry."" But Mr Sargeant's family said there were ""serious failings"" with the handling of the case. They also said a coroner's inquest would not be able to unveil the complete picture. They said: ""An independent inquiry will ask all the questions that need to be asked and have not been answered and will determine the reasons for the serious failings in following the correct procedures, practices and protocols, and the reasons for the complete abdication of responsibility and duty of care that was owed to Carl."" It comes after former minister Leighton Andrews claimed Mr Jones knew his colleague was ""fragile"" before sacking him. He also spoke of a ""toxic"" atmosphere in government rife with ""minor bullying, mind-games, power-games and favouritism"". Friday's announcement comes following pressure from Welsh Tory leader Andrew Davies, who also called for an inquiry into the culture within government."

The 36-year-old was sent off before the start of a Europa League tie in Portugal earlier this month for appearing to kick a Marseille supporter who had apparently verbally abused him. Evra, who was one of Marseille's substitutes for the match at Vitoria Guimaraes, seemed to get into an altercation with some of his own team's fans as he walked along the touchline with team-mates prior to kick off. Video showed him appearing to aim a kick at one of several Marseille supporters who had seemingly scaled barriers to reach the advertising hoardings. UEFA banned the full-back from all European club football until 30 June and fined him â¬10,000 (Â£8,825). Marseille, who were fined â¬25,000 (Â£22,000) for a pitch invasion by fans, criticised both player and supporters who, it claimed, insulted Evra. In a statement on its website, Marseille said Evra ""committed an irreparable act by responding to provocations from a handful of individuals. Nothing justified such a reaction, especially from a senior player. ""In that context...both parties agreed to end the collaboration by mutual consent. ""This incident also highlighted the unacceptable attitude of a small number of people who uttered insults and threats of violence towards the player and his family before contemptuously invading the pitch. ""Such behaviour, which exposes the club to sanctions, has no place in the stands of a football stadium and at Marseille in particular,"" it said. The incident carried echoes of Eric Cantona's infamous ""kung-fu"" kick on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons in 1995. The Manchester United striker was banned for nine months from football worldwide and ordered to do 120 hours of community service."

It said the date, 10 November, had not shifted for the past three years because of the lack of progress closing the gap. The charity's report was compiled using figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which had just last month declared the pay gap at its lowest level on record at 9.1% on the measure of median hourly earnings. The society found the gulf widening for younger women under a different, average measure reported by the ONS. :: Opinion: Why are UK women working for free? It said that because the gap was widest for older women, it meant the UK was actually ""going backwards"" in its pay parity efforts. The Fawcett Society measured the gap for women in their 50s at 18.6%. It said those in their 20s were now suffering a 5.5% shortfall this year - up from 1.1% in 2011. Chief executive Sam Smethers said that was extremely worrying. ""At a time when we are breaking the taboo of talking about sexual harassment in the workplace we need to wake up to the fact that a culture which tolerates or even fosters sexual harassment isn't going to pay women properly either, and we know that younger women are particularly likely to experience harassment,"" she said.

""There are no excuses, employers now need to get on with the job of publishing their pay gap and pledge to improve workplace equality."" Ms Smethers said she hoped efforts to address the gap would help accelerate the path to parity. ""Employers with 250 staff or more need to review their pay systems and publish their gender pay gaps, with a clear action plan in place to close it,"" she said. ""All employers need to take a long hard look at their workplace culture. ""Discrimination and sexual harassment can be hidden and more common than they think.

Comedy actresses Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov are among the accusers and they told the New York Times he had masturbated in front of them after inviting them to his hotel room after a show in 2002. Another actress, Abby Schachner, said the comedian masturbated while he was on the phone to her when she called to invite him to one of her shows.

Louis CK said in his statement: ""These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my d*** without asking first, which is also true. ""But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your d*** isn't a question. It's a predicament for them.

The market had been primed for half year pre-tax profits, on an underlying basis, of Â£200m. An outturn of Â£219.1m, then, came as a pleasant surprise to investors, even if it did represent a drop of 5.3% on the same period last year. There was another pleasant surprise in the clothing performance - long the Achilles heel for M&S. :: M&S signals more store closures in shake-up Total clothing and home sales during the most recent quarter were actually up 0.6% on the same period last year while, on a like-for-like basis (which measures sales in stores trading in the same format for the last year or more) they were down by a mere 0.1%. That was better than most M&S-watchers had been expecting. There are growing indications that the decline in clothing has been stemmed and Steve Rowe, the chief executive, could point to the fact that M&S has cut the number of sales in clothing and home from nine to four while also cutting back on promotions. That is showing up in further improvement in margins. That was the good - or, at least, the reasonably positive - news. More disappointing was the admission that like-for-like sales of food, undoubtedly the strongest card for M&S during the last decade, fell by 0.1% both during the latest quarter and during the first half of the year as a whole. Total food sales were up by 4.4%, reflecting new store openings, but Mr Rowe was warning ominously about the ""headwinds facing our food business"" having ""intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". Accordingly, while Mr Rowe insists ""investment returns remain high"", the company is reining back on expansion of its popular Simply Food chain. It is not difficult to detect the hand of Archie Norman, the new M&S chairman, in either this decision or in the departure of Helen Weir, the chief financial officer, whose exit was first reported last night by Sky's Mark Kleinman. Mr Norman, who succeeded the urbane former investment banker Robert Swannell in September, is a hard-driving turnaround expert still revered in the City for the way, a quarter of a century ago, he and Allan Leighton rescued Asda from collapse before selling it to Wal-Mart for Â£6.7bn in 1999. Most sector-watchers who know him reckon Mr Norman will be pushing the likeable Mr Rowe to accelerate the pace of change at M&S and in particular the speed at which the retailer brings down its costs. As M&S seeks to place greater emphasis on its digital sales, Mr Rowe had previously announced plans to close 30 of its larger stores, but insists now that was the ""minimum"" and that M&S would ""go faster"" in closing underperforming stores. The company confirmed that, by 2022, it will have 60 fewer stores than it did in 2016 - yet many will question whether it could not be reducing its space by more. By then, meanwhile, M&S aims to be making a third of its sales online. Other questions remain. One is over Mr Rowe's recent appointment of Jill McDonald as head of clothing and home. Ms McDonald is well-regarded, due to successful stints as managing director of McDonald's UK and as chief executive of Halfords, but some investors worry about her lack of specific experience in fashion, particularly as her appointment triggered the departure of the former head of clothing, Jo Jenkins. The concern is understandable. Fashion, particularly women's fashion, is the fulcrum of M&S. Get that right and absolutely everything else follows. Ever since the late Sir Richard Greenbury retired nearly 19 years ago, M&S has had a string of leaders - Peter Salsbury, Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes, Sir Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland - who have all grappled with trying to either stem decline or revive the group's fortunes. That said, in Mr Norman and Mr Rowe, M&S probably has as good a combination of chairman and chief executive as it could hope for in seeking to achieve the latter. In Mr Norman, it has someone who will agitate for rapid and even radical change, but who also boasts experience of transforming a low-growth retailer into a high-growth one. In Mr Rowe, meanwhile, it has someone who has spent almost his entire career at M&S, who is steeped in its values, who loves the business, who understands its staff and customers and who can use that as potent weapons in driving change. As demonstrated by the warm response to its Christmas advertisements featuring Paddington Bear, there is still massive public goodwill towards M&S, probably greater than any other retailer enjoys with the possible exception of John Lewis. That is a fabulous platform on which to build."

The University of Bath economics student was discovered on Westmoreland Road in Bath in the early hours of 30 September, after walking home from The Second Bridge nightclub. He was taken to the city's Royal United Hospital before being transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. He died three days later of internal head injuries. The video shows his last movements on the morning of Saturday 30 September: :: 3.40am: Footage shows Alex leaving the city centre along Dorchester Street, by the city's train station and main bus station :: 3.41am: He's caught on camera walking past the Esso garage on the A36 Lower Bristol Road :: 3.42am: Alex walks past the Green Park Tavern into Westmoreland Road - this is the last sighting of him :: 3.46am: There is no sign of Alex on footage taken from the U1 First Bus, which turns into Westmoreland Road, and he is not at the bus stop :: Between 3.46am and 3.49am: A group of five people turn into Westmoreland Road and find Alex lying on the ground near the bus stop :: 3.49am: An ambulance is called Police investigating his death said they are currently looking into three main scenarios - whether Mr Green was injured in a fall, was involved in a road traffic collision or was assaulted. Detective Inspector Dom Graham, who is leading the investigation, said his death is being treated as ""unexplained"" and appealed for the public's help. ""We're hoping the release of more footage which shows Alex's last known movements will help jog people's memories and encourage witnesses to come forward,"" he said. The police appealed for anybody who saw Mr Green in the Second Bridge nightclub on the night of September 29 or morning of September 30 to contact them. They are also hoping to hear from people who walked or drove through Westmoreland Road between 3.30 and 4am, or anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious around that time. They also want to speak anybody on the U1 First Bus which turned into Westmoreland Road at 3.46am, including a group of students who got off at the next stop in Lower Oldfield Park."

The source said that the 28-year-old driver told police he had acted ""deliberately"", but was not on a list of known extremists. Police said they were looking into his psychiatric history after he told officers he heard voices telling him to hurt someone, local media said. The driver is also reported to have spent time in a psychiatric hospital and has a history of acute schizophrenia and drug use. All three students hit by the car were Chinese. Two men aged 22 and 23, and a 23-year woman who was in a more serious condition, were hit on a pedestrian crossing outside IGS College just before 4pm local time. They were taken by ambulance to Purpan Hospital. The driver attempted to drive off but was stopped by police and arrested straight away. Police say the man is known for previous drugs-related offences. He said he wanted revenge, but did not specify what for. Toulouse prosecutor Pierre-Yves Couilleau, said his office had opened an attempted murder investigation ""because the driver was planning to mow people down"". He said: ""At this point, we are looking at the psychiatric profile of the suspect, who was sentenced a dozen times and was subject to probation and care obligations."" Paul, a communications student at IGS Campus, told La Depeche: ""I was in class and I heard sirens. ""We thought there was an accident because when we got off the campus there were a lot of police cars around. ""The school management did not explain what was going on."" Several over-18 colleges are located on the campus, including the International Institute of Trade and Development.

Scotland Yard has been running Operation Takahe for two years, working closely with the RSPCA and South Norwood Animal Rescue Liberty (SNARL), an animal rescue organisation. So far there have been no arrests, although the lead detective has told Sky News that out of 30 to 40 names they are focusing on two or three suspects. Although there is no direct evidence of a risk to human life, Detective Sergeant Andy Collin says the fear is the killing could escalate. ""There is a known link between serial killers and harming animals when you look into their dark history,"" he said. ""If you look at offending patterns, the assumption is this killer is getting some form of gratification. The concern is they will cease getting that gratification and escalate the attacks to humans, specifically vulnerable women and girls."" The number of animal mutilations and deaths is on the rise. In 2015 when the investigation began there were eight recorded deaths. Last year that number was 114, including the first locations outside of the M25. So far this year 246 animals have been targeted. Sky News was granted access to join Tony Jenkins, who co-runs SNARL with his partner, on call. Mr Jenkins told us they get a new report about an animal killing on a near-daily basis. ""For two years now it has completely taken over my life. I can't make plans because I wake up in the morning, feed the animals, the phone goes and I'm jumping in the car and off to God knows where."" While filming with SNARL, a fresh call comes in from Liz, who works at a vets in Wigan: ""It was what we thought was a cat but the RSPCA officer said it could possibly be small dog. It was found in a plastic bag near our back gate yesterday morning. ""They'd taken off the legs and the head... sorry, I feel really sick just saying it... they'd taken off the legs and the head, there's no other way of identifying it from our point of view."" Calls like this come into SNARL frequently. ""It's having a devastating effect and ripping people's lives apart,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""It's widespread, it's very frequent. Now because of the awareness we're getting many more cases reported to us."" There have been two sightings of a possible suspect and a description was issued of a white man in his 40s with short brown hair and possible facial scarring. But it's not known whether it's one person behind the killings or a gang. ""Obviously a psychopath and they've obviously got sociopathic tendencies... a very dangerous person,"" Tony said. Anne from Surrey lost one of her cats to the killer this summer. Amber was found in a neighbour's garden. She found out after receiving a call from SNARL. ""I still cry about it on a regular basis. I worry about what he's doing to other cats every night - is he doing it tonight?"" said Anne. ""It plays on my mind. I think about what else he could be capable of if it wasn't just cats. We've got CCTV around the house now and are putting in floodlights to light up the gardens. I don't feel safe. ""I could go to prison for him. I hate him that much. I'll never forgive him. Ever."" Animal charities PETA and Outpaced are offering a combined reward of Â£10,000 for any information which leads to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible for the killings. Forensic experts at ArroGen Veterinary Forensics in Surrey are helping examine some of the corpses in the hope of finding fresh evidence."

Ms McCall, who has spent seven years in the airline's top job, will remain at the company until the end of the year to help Mr Lundgren with the transition, easyJet said. He joins easyJet at a difficult time for the travel sector - with Brexit looming large on the horizon. EasyJet has moved to navigate the potential for disruption to its flights by applying for a new air operator's certificate in Austria to allow it to continue flying in the European Union after Britain's divorce from the bloc. Announcing the appointment, easyJet chairman John Barton said: ""Johan has proven experience in European travel as chief executive and in broader group roles. ""He is strategic yet operationally focused and has proved himself to be a customer-centric, charismatic and successful leader. ""Finally, I wanted to reiterate everyone at easyJet's thanks to Carolyn for all she has done for the airline and to wish her well in her exciting new role."" EasyJet shares were broadly flat on the announcement. Mr Lundgren said: ""I have flown with and been a fan of easyJet and its wonderful people for many years. ""This is an exciting time to be joining Europe's leading airline. Carolyn has built a fantastic team and with them I look forward to contributing to easyJet's continued success."" Mr Lundgren, the company said, would receive an annual salary of Â£740,000 with a maximum yearly bonus of 200% of that sum.

Authorities say the statute of limitations, which sets out the maximum time that parties have to initiate legal proceedings from the date of an alleged offence, expired in Feldman's case. The 46-year-old actor said he had informed the LAPD of the names of ""very powerful"" men who abused him as a child in Hollywood. A teen idol in the 1980s, Feldman and his frequent co-star Corey Haim starred in some of the biggest hits of the decades, including Goonies and The Lost Boys. :: Former child actors reveal sexual abuse in Hollywood Their collaboration led to the popular sit-com The Two Coreys, and they became an industry phenomenon. Feldman has for many years claimed both him and Haim were abused by a ""paedophile ring"" operating in Hollywood, and has blamed the abuse on Haim's drug addiction and subsequent death in 2010. Last month, Feldman vowed to expose at least six names of men involved, and launched a campaign to fund a documentary produced, directed and distributed by him, in which he would reveal the names of his abusers. The money, Feldman said, will be enough to cover the production and distribution of the film, but also to hire a legal team to protect him against possible lawsuits. :: Hollywood sex abuse: Are the kids alright? ""I've been silenced my whole life but just over the past few days since I've made the announcement, I've been arrested, I had a near-death experience last night where I thought I was almost going to be killed,"" he said in the crowdfunding video. ""Two trucks came speeding at me at the same time on a crosswalk. And then several of my band members have decided to quit because they were fearing for their lives. ""I'm very alone, but I need to protect myself and I need to protect myself and my family. I need additional security and I need a legal team to help represent me so I can fulfil this mission."" More than $200,000 (Â£150,000) have so far been donated to his crowdfunding campaign, falling short of the $10m (Â£7m) goal set by Feldman."
2017-11-10,"The disputed President of Catalonia has told Sky News the Spanish state has ""damaged democracy in order to stop independence"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171110222708/https://news.sky.com/story/disputed-catalan-president-carles-puigdemont-spain-has-damaged-democracy-11121347,"In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Carles Puigdemont said the European Union is failing to recognise the reality of the situation in Catalonia and failing to act in the face of ""authoritarian actions"". ""It is very disappointing to see that in a Europe Union that we are all a part of, they can respond to situations in Poland and Hungary but cannot respond to the situation in Catalonia,"" he said, speaking from a secret location in Brussels. ""To be treated like a criminal, like a drug trafficker, a paedophile, like a serial killer. I think this is abuse... this isn't politics, this is using the courts to do politics."" Mr Puigdemont is the subject of a European arrest warrant which he is appealing through the Belgian courts. He is wanted in Spain on crimes of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds after the 1 October referendum and subsequent declaration of independence, both deemed illegal by the Spanish government. When asked if he was willing to spend 30 years in jail, if that's what happens, he replied: ""It's a threat because the crime I am accused of could result in 30 years in prison. It's madness. It's not justice. It's vengeance."" He added:: ""I am not a rebel. I don't have the spirit of a rebel nor the wish to be one. I consider myself to be very disciplined. I just want to carry out what my parliament has approved. ""This is very normal, there is nothing rebellious about that. It's very uncomfortable for me to have this role of a 'rebel' and i don't want to play it."" The exiled president left Barcelona for Brussels a week ago. He claims he is not running from justice but seeking it. He said he will not receive a fair trial in Madrid. Eight Catalan ministers, who appeared in court in Madrid last week, have been denied bail and jailed pending their trial. After the referendum, the Spanish government triggered Article 155 of its constitution, removing Catalonia of its autonomy and dissolving the parliament. Fresh elections were called by Madrid for 21 December in an attempt to diffuse the situation and settle the matter. The gamble by Madrid is that anti-independence parties will secure the most votes. He said: ""The Spanish state has damaged democracy in order to stop independence because through democracy which is the only thing we believe in, the reality is undeniable. So we need to recover that democracy that has been damaged by the Spanish state."" No European country has recognised his declaration of independence and the European Commission has repeatedly said the matter is a domestic one for Spain. In a clear expression of disappointment and even isolation, he said: ""We deserve respect and we have earned the right to be listened to ... maybe not understood, but don't just listen to one side, to the powerful Spanish institutional machinery, which is very powerful, listen to the other side too."" He added: ""I admit that what's happening in Catalonia is not pleasant for the European Union, but it's a reality nevertheless."" ""The problem is that the EU doesn't recognise the reality,"" he said. The result of the 1 October referendum was 90% for 'yes', but it was secured on a low turnout of just over 40%. Most anti-independence voters boycotted the vote. How does that make his independence declaration valid, he was asked. ""Yes - they are very good questions. In conditions with a very aggressive state, 'chasing' [confiscating] ballot boxes, arresting politicians and propaganda, 43% turnout is a miracle,"" he said. He said that the number of Catalans who voted ""yes"" was bigger than the number who voted yes to the Catalan statue of autonomy, implying that the independence vote was legitimate. Asked whether he would accept the result of the 21 December election, he said he was ready to accept the result of a proper referendum. ""[The election] is not exactly a referendum. It's an abnormal situation."" He suggested the December vote would not be objective because people would fear the consequences of voting with independence parties. In recent weeks more than 2,000 companies have moved their headquarters out of Catalonia, concerned about the uncertainty economic impact of the crisis. He blamed their relocation not on his own declaration of independence but on the Spanish government for introducing a law making relocation out of Catalonia easier. ""The economic cost of authoritarian actions against Catalonia will be paid by the whole of the EU not just Spain and Catalonia. It's not very intelligent to declare an economic war against Catalonia just to fight against the independence movement."" Catalonia accounts for 2% of European Union growth. The region has a growth rate of 3.5% which is now threatened by the crisis."

Ms McCarthy said the Luton North MP sent her a series of letters and cards about her appearance, including one in which he described having a dream about her. But Mr Hopkins said Ms McCarthy's complaint had caused him ""immense personal hurt and utter dismay"" from someone he counted as a friend. He added: ""I cannot understand why a Parliamentarian of such experience and standing, who is also such a long term friend, would not have told me that she was unhappy with any aspect of our friendship rather than going straight to the national press. ""At a minimum I would have expected a Parliamentary colleague to raise any complaint through normal channels, allowing me due process and a fair chance to defend myself, if necessary."" Ms McCarthy said she decided to go public after activist Ava Etemadzadeh complained last week about the behaviour of Mr Hopkins. He was suspended by Labour after Ms Etemadzadeh contacted the party again with fresh information following an initial complaint over dealings with the MP in 2014 and 2015. Mr Hopkins was reprimanded at the time by the-then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton but was appointed shadow culture secretary in 2016. He ""categorically denies"" any inappropriate conduct in relation to Ms Etemadzadeh. Ms McCarthy, 52, first met Mr Hopkins, 76, when she was in her late 20s and they were both involved in Labour politics in her home town of Luton. In 1994, when she was chairwoman of Luton North constituency Labour Party (CLP) and he chaired Luton South CLP, they went out for lunch, with Ms McCarthy believing it was to discuss political issues. He later sent her a card saying he had invited her ""because you are attractive, intelligent and charming"" before urging her to ""dispose"" of the note, she said. In a second note, Mr Hopkins enclosed a photo of Ms McCarthy and described her as ""pretty"" before again asking her to dispose of it, she claimed. He also sent a postcard, which appears to be dated 1996, in an envelope to her place of work, asking whether her employer specialised in ""pretty, petite brunettes"". Ms McCarthy said she went to another lunch with Mr Hopkins because she found it awkward to say no to the invitation. He sent a card afterwards suggesting it ""would be nice to meet again"". On another occasion, also believed to be in 1996, Ms McCarthy said Mr Hopkins placed his hand on hers when she was not looking as she was getting out of a car. A note sent in the run-up to the 1997 general election said: ""You know I think you are lovely ... but I never see enough of you ... after May 1st perhaps ... K x."" The letters then stopped until her 50th birthday, when Mr Hopkins sent a note on parliamentary writing paper to mark the occasion. By this time Ms McCarthy was an MP. A final letter was sent some time in 2015/16 but it is not clear if it was written after he was reprimanded for the incident involving Ms Etemadzadeh. In it, he described having a dream about Ms McCarthy and said she remained a ""very attractive woman"", according to Ms McCarthy."

Vaccination against HPV - which is thought to cause nearly all cervical cancers - has been offered to girls aged 11 to 13 since 2008. Professor Peter Sasieni, lead author of the study, said the finding could slash the amount of cervical screenings - saving the NHS time and money. He said: ""(Vaccinated) women are far less likely to develop cervical cancer so they don't need such stringent routine checking as those at a higher risk. ""This decision would free up resources for where they are needed most."" In December 2019, changes to cervical testing will be introduced in England. Under the new programme, cervical samples will tested for HPV but only checked for abnormal cells if the virus is found. Currently, samples are checked for abnormalities first, which experts say is less efficient. Plans to introduce this new HPV test are also being prepared for patients in Scotland and Wales. When the new test comes in, women who are not vaccinated should only need seven screenings over their lifetime, according to the QMUL study. Cancer Research UK's head of health information described the development as ""great news for women"". Dr Julie Sharp said: ""The cervical screening programme is already very successful, and has led to a dramatic fall in deaths from the disease since its introduction. ""While we hope to see these improvements to the screening programme in the future, it's important that women continue to take up invitations for cervical screening. ""So if you're all set for your next screen, keep that appointment."""

However, the family of Mr Sargeant, 49, said asking the Permanent Secretary to start preparations for a probe meant it would not be truly independent. In a statement they said: ""The inquiry must be established by a body that is fully independent of Welsh Government. ""The Permanent Secretary reports directly to the First Minister and is therefore not independent. ""We believe that a truly independent body must also be responsible for agreeing the terms of reference and appointing the chair and secretariat for the inquiry."" Mr Sargeant is believed to have killed himself four days after being suspended from the Labour Party and removed from his role as cabinet secretary for communities and children following claims of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". A spokesman for Mr Jones said: ""Further to the First Minister's comments yesterday about the need for independent scrutiny of his actions and decisions in relation to Carl Sargeant, he agrees that there should be an independent inquiry and it would be proper to ask a senior QC to lead that work. ""To ensure this happens separately from his office, the First Minister has asked the Permanent Secretary to begin preparatory work for this inquiry."" But Mr Sargeant's family said there were ""serious failings"" with the handling of the case. They also said a coroner's inquest would not be able to unveil the complete picture. They said: ""An independent inquiry will ask all the questions that need to be asked and have not been answered and will determine the reasons for the serious failings in following the correct procedures, practices and protocols, and the reasons for the complete abdication of responsibility and duty of care that was owed to Carl."" It comes after former minister Leighton Andrews claimed Mr Jones knew his colleague was ""fragile"" before sacking him. He also spoke of a ""toxic"" atmosphere in government rife with ""minor bullying, mind-games, power-games and favouritism"".

The controversial decision saw Switzerland's Ricardo Rodriguez score the resultant penalty and the Swiss went on to win the first leg of the playoff 1-0. The penalty led to an angry response from Evans' wife Lisa, who tweeted: ""Romanian gypsy c***!!! And to actually think Northern Ireland has probably homed one of his smelly relatives!! Ungrateful t***!! Anyway onwards and upwards. #GAWA."" The remark attracted strong criticism, and she deactivated her account, before Evans issued a statement to apologise. The comment, released through the Irish Football Association, said: ""On behalf of my wife, I would like to apologise unreservedly for the content and language contained in the tweet that she issued last night. ""The comments were published in the heat of the moment and are not representative of her views."" Mrs Evans later reactivated her account to share her own apology. I would like to sincerely apologise to anyone I offended for the language contained in my tweet, I understand it was completely unacceptable, I should have never have let my emotions take over. I would never condone racism in any way. She wrote: ""I would like to sincerely apologise to anyone I offended for the language contained in my tweet, I understand it was completely unacceptable, I should have never have let my emotions take over. I would never condone racism in any way."" The decision to award a penalty, made be referee Ovidiu Hategan, has been heavily criticised after replays of the apparent hand ball appeared inconclusive. Evans was booked for the incident, so will be suspended for the second leg of the tie in Basel on Sunday. He is understood to be flying out with the team anyway."

Flight BE331 was diverted to the international hub where it landed safely at about 1.30pm with the front of the plane unsupported, and the runway was closed to other aircraft. The plane was carrying 52 passengers, one infant, and four crew members. One person was taken to hospital with a minor hand injury. No other injuries have been reported. Images from the scene showed the jet tipped forward on to its nose. In a statement, the airline said: ""Flybe can confirm that one passenger was taken to hospital with a minor hand injury following an incident involving one of our aircraft this afternoon which landed with its nose gear raised at Belfast International Airport at 1.30pm local time.

Alibaba said gross merchandise volume (GMV) exceeded 10bn yuan (Â£1bn) in a little over three minutes and the total had reached 19.1bn yuan in under six minutes - more than the entire day's sales in 2012. Nicole Kidman and Pharrell Williams were among the stars who helped get the eighth Singles' Day off to a glittering start. The actress and the singer joined co-founder and chairman Jack Ma and Chinese musicians and film stars such as Zhang Ziyi and Fan Bingbing in Shanghai to count down to the start at midnight on Friday. Last year it was David and Victoria Beckham and Kobe Bryant. As soon as the virtual doors opened, shoppers rushed in to fill up their carts with bargains. One online retailer is offering a lifetime supply of baijiu liquor for a single payment of 11,111 yuan (Â£1,275). The price is a reference to 11.11, the first name given to the day, meant to represent both the date (11 November) and the single people doing the shopping. An estimated 1.5 billion parcels will need to be delivered over the next week. The sale is seen as a barometer of Chinese consumer confidence and is closely watched by analysts and investors. The headline sales number is likely to top last year's total of 113bn yuan (Â£13bn), an increase of nearly a third from 2015."

""Sepp Blatter grabbed my ass, it was a few years ago at the Ballon d'Or ceremony just before I got on stage,"" she told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso on the sidelines of the Web Summit in Lisbon. A spokesman for the disgraced former FIFA chief, who was president of world football's governing body from 1998 to 2015 until being banned for corruption, said the claim was ""ridiculous"". Blatter was banned from football for six years when the corruption scandal broke. The US-Swiss investigation is still ongoing, with more than 40 people charged. When it comes to the women's game, Blatter has a history of what many see as sexist behaviour. Solo's US teammate Alex Morgan said he failed to recognise her at the 2012 Ballon d'Or ceremony, despite the striker being one of the nominees for the women's Player of the Year. In 2004, Blatter said female players could boost the popularity of the sport by playing in tighter shorts. Solo, a World Cup winner and two-time Olympic champion, said sexual harassment from male officials was a common problem in the women's game. ""I have seen this all of my career and I would like to see more athletes speak about their experiences,"" she said. ""It's out of control, not just in Hollywood but everywhere,"" Solo added, referencing the sexual assault allegations that have emerged from the worlds of entertainment, politics and sport since the scandal surrounding movie mogul Harvey Weinstein erupted."

Those aged 55 and over are more confused on the subject, with just 36% saying they are certain where the line is. The findings come in the wake of the Hollywood and Westminster scandals, which have prompted debate on what is and isn't appropriate behaviour. The Sky Data poll also reveals: For a clear definition on the issue, Sky News spoke to Professor Jennifer Brown, who has studied harassment for 25 years. She said: ""Definitions of sexual harassment are unwanted behaviour, unreciprocated behaviour (which) causes distress. ""If the recipient feels uncomfortable, or they don't like it, they signal that they don't like it and it persists. Then it can be harassment."" Professor Brown, from the London School of Economics and Political Science, added that sexual harassment is complicated. She said: ""It depends on the who, what, when and where - so who's doing it, to whom and what circumstances. ""What has changed is there are new channels for it, so when I first looked at it, 20-odd years ago, there was no mobile phones, so sexting, the sending of explicit texts, the sending of explicit emails, these sort of things didn't happen. ""So there's a degree of morphing, where the behaviour adapts to modern circumstances."" :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,002 Sky customers online between 7 and 9 November.

2017-11-11,"One thing Marks and Spencer has been excellent at during recent years, whatever you think of it as a retailer, has been its ability to downplay City expectations ahead of publication of its results.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171111230455/https://news.sky.com/story/how-will-ms-measure-up-as-changes-accelerate-11118775,"The latest were no exception. The market had been primed for half year pre-tax profits, on an underlying basis, of Â£200m. An outturn of Â£219.1m, then, came as a pleasant surprise to investors, even if it did represent a drop of 5.3% on the same period last year. There was another pleasant surprise in the clothing performance - long the Achilles heel for M&S. :: M&S signals more store closures in shake-up Total clothing and home sales during the most recent quarter were actually up 0.6% on the same period last year while, on a like-for-like basis (which measures sales in stores trading in the same format for the last year or more) they were down by a mere 0.1%. That was better than most M&S-watchers had been expecting. There are growing indications that the decline in clothing has been stemmed and Steve Rowe, the chief executive, could point to the fact that M&S has cut the number of sales in clothing and home from nine to four while also cutting back on promotions. That is showing up in further improvement in margins. That was the good - or, at least, the reasonably positive - news. More disappointing was the admission that like-for-like sales of food, undoubtedly the strongest card for M&S during the last decade, fell by 0.1% both during the latest quarter and during the first half of the year as a whole. Total food sales were up by 4.4%, reflecting new store openings, but Mr Rowe was warning ominously about the ""headwinds facing our food business"" having ""intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". Accordingly, while Mr Rowe insists ""investment returns remain high"", the company is reining back on expansion of its popular Simply Food chain. It is not difficult to detect the hand of Archie Norman, the new M&S chairman, in either this decision or in the departure of Helen Weir, the chief financial officer, whose exit was first reported last night by Sky's Mark Kleinman. Mr Norman, who succeeded the urbane former investment banker Robert Swannell in September, is a hard-driving turnaround expert still revered in the City for the way, a quarter of a century ago, he and Allan Leighton rescued Asda from collapse before selling it to Wal-Mart for Â£6.7bn in 1999. Most sector-watchers who know him reckon Mr Norman will be pushing the likeable Mr Rowe to accelerate the pace of change at M&S and in particular the speed at which the retailer brings down its costs. As M&S seeks to place greater emphasis on its digital sales, Mr Rowe had previously announced plans to close 30 of its larger stores, but insists now that was the ""minimum"" and that M&S would ""go faster"" in closing underperforming stores. The company confirmed that, by 2022, it will have 60 fewer stores than it did in 2016 - yet many will question whether it could not be reducing its space by more. By then, meanwhile, M&S aims to be making a third of its sales online. Other questions remain. One is over Mr Rowe's recent appointment of Jill McDonald as head of clothing and home. Ms McDonald is well-regarded, due to successful stints as managing director of McDonald's UK and as chief executive of Halfords, but some investors worry about her lack of specific experience in fashion, particularly as her appointment triggered the departure of the former head of clothing, Jo Jenkins. The concern is understandable. Fashion, particularly women's fashion, is the fulcrum of M&S. Get that right and absolutely everything else follows. Ever since the late Sir Richard Greenbury retired nearly 19 years ago, M&S has had a string of leaders - Peter Salsbury, Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes, Sir Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland - who have all grappled with trying to either stem decline or revive the group's fortunes. That said, in Mr Norman and Mr Rowe, M&S probably has as good a combination of chairman and chief executive as it could hope for in seeking to achieve the latter. In Mr Norman, it has someone who will agitate for rapid and even radical change, but who also boasts experience of transforming a low-growth retailer into a high-growth one. In Mr Rowe, meanwhile, it has someone who has spent almost his entire career at M&S, who is steeped in its values, who loves the business, who understands its staff and customers and who can use that as potent weapons in driving change. As demonstrated by the warm response to its Christmas advertisements featuring Paddington Bear, there is still massive public goodwill towards M&S, probably greater than any other retailer enjoys with the possible exception of John Lewis. That is a fabulous platform on which to build."

The University of Bath economics student was discovered on Westmoreland Road in Bath in the early hours of 30 September, after walking home from The Second Bridge nightclub. He was taken to the city's Royal United Hospital before being transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. He died three days later of internal head injuries. The video shows his last movements on the morning of Saturday 30 September: :: 3.40am: Footage shows Alex leaving the city centre along Dorchester Street, by the city's train station and main bus station :: 3.41am: He's caught on camera walking past the Esso garage on the A36 Lower Bristol Road :: 3.42am: Alex walks past the Green Park Tavern into Westmoreland Road - this is the last sighting of him :: 3.46am: There is no sign of Alex on footage taken from the U1 First Bus, which turns into Westmoreland Road, and he is not at the bus stop :: Between 3.46am and 3.49am: A group of five people turn into Westmoreland Road and find Alex lying on the ground near the bus stop :: 3.49am: An ambulance is called Police investigating his death said they are currently looking into three main scenarios - whether Mr Green was injured in a fall, was involved in a road traffic collision or was assaulted. Detective Inspector Dom Graham, who is leading the investigation, said his death is being treated as ""unexplained"" and appealed for the public's help. ""We're hoping the release of more footage which shows Alex's last known movements will help jog people's memories and encourage witnesses to come forward,"" he said. The police appealed for anybody who saw Mr Green in the Second Bridge nightclub on the night of September 29 or morning of September 30 to contact them. They are also hoping to hear from people who walked or drove through Westmoreland Road between 3.30 and 4am, or anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious around that time. They also want to speak anybody on the U1 First Bus which turned into Westmoreland Road at 3.46am, including a group of students who got off at the next stop in Lower Oldfield Park."

Ms Plummer, from Hull, faces a long prison sentence if convicted and she has been held in a 15ft by 15ft cell with 25 other women for weeks. MP Karl Turner said her partner Omar Caboo has shown evidence which proves he has a bad back, and therefore confirms she was bringing the medication to Egypt for him from the UK. Tramadol is listed by Egyptian authorities as an illegal drug because of its wide use as a heroin substitute. The MP said: ""Tramadol is a controlled Class C drug in the UK, and is banned entirely in Egypt because it's a recreation drug of choice and changes hands for money and is very addictive and they are desperate to stamp it out."" Mr Turner said of Ms Plummer: ""She's a woman of good character in this country from a law-abiding family, and clearly the whole thing will be a dreadful experience. ""Even for the most ardent criminal, this would be a terribly frightening experience. She's sharing a cell with at least 25 other women, none of which speak English."""

By night Joe - played by twins Ethan and Tobias - is having fun with his oversized friend, but during the day he's paying the price and falling asleep on the football pitch. Luckily, ever-thoughtful Moz spots his sleepiness, and thanks to a cleverly chosen Christmas gift (purchased in John Lewis) he manages to solve his little friend's monster-induced insomnia. The ad is directed by Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind director Michel Gondry to the soundtrack of The Beatles' Golden Slumbers - and many on social media felt that its release marks the official arrival of Christmas. Twitter user Lee reacted to the heartwarming ad, writing: ""No no I'm fine.. I got something in my eye.. *after watching the john lewis advert*"". While Kathryn Louise wrote on Instagram: ""Thank goodness; a proper Christmas advert not seen from you guys since the snowman ad!! Love it"". Trust me, no one wants to know what's under my bed.  #UnderTheBed Others were less impressed with the offering, with Alice Westoby saying John Lewis had ""ripped off Where The Wild Things Are"". While Dave Corkery wrote: So let me get this straight... Boy meets monster. Monster befriends boy. Boy is tired. Monster commits suicide?"" Meanwhile, American Computer Science teacher John Lewis, whose Twitter bio helpfully states that he is ""not a retail store"" got in ahead of the advert launch, writing: ""Trust me, no one wants to know what's under my bed"". Earlier this week the launch of the Marks & Spencer Xmas ad raised eyebrows when some viewers thought they heard the F-word directed towards the hero of the ad - Paddington bear. Both retailers will be hoping to cash in on merchandising, with Moz and Paddington cuddly toys and the night light featured in the John Lewis ad all available for sale. John Lewis has already had to respond to complaints that the night light had sold out online, with a spokesperson for the store telling Sky News they are staggering release of the product online, but there is plenty of stock available in store."
2017-11-11,"More than 4,000 headteachers have backed a letter to the Chancellor asking him not to cut school budgets.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171111230455/https://news.sky.com/story/fund-us-fairly-schools-put-pressure-on-chancellor-over-cash-11121770,"Teachers from primary, special and secondary schools from 25 different counties have joined a campaign concerned about the Government's new National Funding Formula. The formula is meant to make the allocation of school budgets fairer. But the Worth Less? campaign says it won't work. The group is led by headteacher Jules White, whose own school, Tanbridge House in West Sussex, is one of the country's lowest funded. Mr White admits his budget is so tight they've cut teachers and can't afford to properly use cleaners. ""Day to day it's desperate,"" he said. ""If I lose a teacher I can't afford to replace them. Our children most crucially are being disadvantaged as well. They're all going to sit the same GCSE yet they're in class sizes of 35, they don't get one-to-one support that they want. ""I'm really proud of the school, we're doing great, but think how well we could do if we were just funded adequately."" Even under the new formula Mr White reckons his school won't receive enough extra money. He claims the Government's own figures highlight the imbalance. Under the new formula, in 2018-19 an average funded primary school in Devon will receive Â£407,200 less than the same size school in the London borough of Greenwich. An average secondary school in Oxford will get Â£4,050,200 less than the same size school in Hackney. That's the equivalent of 133 teachers. We met year ten students during a maths lesson. They agreed the school's budget sums seem unfair. One pupil said: ""It's very unexpected, when you're at school you just think that you're the same as everyone else. We just feel a bit less worth. Like we're worth less than all those other schools."" Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: ""The introduction of the National Funding Formula from 2018-19, backed by Â£1.3bn of additional investment, has been widely welcomed and will put an end to historic disparities in the system. ""There are no cuts in funding, every school will see an increase in funding through the formula from 2018."" But many dispute the notion of additional investment. Mr White believes in real terms, schools' budgets are still being cut by Â£1.7bn. This is why on Tuesday representatives will deliver a letter to the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, ahead of this month's Budget. Parents have been throwing their support behind the move too. Dad David Gabriel said he's worried the next generation will suffer. ""As class sizes grow then my son's education and all the kids' here and in West Sussex are going to have a substandard education,"" he said. ""And he is actually, in the Government's eyes, worth less than children in other parts of the country."" Mr White says the support behind his campaign couldn't be stronger. As he prepares to head to Number 11 Downing Street he said the message is simple: ""All we're asking is he funds us fairly."""
2017-11-11,"Kerry McCarthy says she suffered unwanted attention from fellow Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins spanning 20 years and found it ""upsetting"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171111230455/https://news.sky.com/story/mp-kerry-mccarthy-says-kelvin-hopkins-dreamt-about-her-in-upsetting-letter-11121571,"The former shadow environment secretary is the first MP to make specific claims of inappropriate behaviour since the Westminster scandal erupted. Ms McCarthy said the Luton North MP sent her a series of letters and cards about her appearance, including one in which he described having a dream about her. But Mr Hopkins said Ms McCarthy's complaint had caused him ""immense personal hurt and utter dismay"" from someone he counted as a friend. He added: ""I cannot understand why a Parliamentarian of such experience and standing, who is also such a long term friend, would not have told me that she was unhappy with any aspect of our friendship rather than going straight to the national press. ""At a minimum I would have expected a Parliamentary colleague to raise any complaint through normal channels, allowing me due process and a fair chance to defend myself, if necessary."" Ms McCarthy said she decided to go public after activist Ava Etemadzadeh complained last week about the behaviour of Mr Hopkins. He was suspended by Labour after Ms Etemadzadeh contacted the party again with fresh information following an initial complaint over dealings with the MP in 2014 and 2015. Mr Hopkins was reprimanded at the time by the-then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton but was appointed shadow culture secretary in 2016. He ""categorically denies"" any inappropriate conduct in relation to Ms Etemadzadeh. Ms McCarthy, 52, first met Mr Hopkins, 76, when she was in her late 20s and they were both involved in Labour politics in her home town of Luton. In 1994, when she was chairwoman of Luton North constituency Labour Party (CLP) and he chaired Luton South CLP, they went out for lunch, with Ms McCarthy believing it was to discuss political issues. He later sent her a card saying he had invited her ""because you are attractive, intelligent and charming"" before urging her to ""dispose"" of the note, she said. In a second note, Mr Hopkins enclosed a photo of Ms McCarthy and described her as ""pretty"" before again asking her to dispose of it, she claimed. He also sent a postcard, which appears to be dated 1996, in an envelope to her place of work, asking whether her employer specialised in ""pretty, petite brunettes"". Ms McCarthy said she went to another lunch with Mr Hopkins because she found it awkward to say no to the invitation. He sent a card afterwards suggesting it ""would be nice to meet again"". On another occasion, also believed to be in 1996, Ms McCarthy said Mr Hopkins placed his hand on hers when she was not looking as she was getting out of a car. A note sent in the run-up to the 1997 general election said: ""You know I think you are lovely ... but I never see enough of you ... after May 1st perhaps ... K x."" The letters then stopped until her 50th birthday, when Mr Hopkins sent a note on parliamentary writing paper to mark the occasion. By this time Ms McCarthy was an MP. A final letter was sent some time in 2015/16 but it is not clear if it was written after he was reprimanded for the incident involving Ms Etemadzadeh. In it, he described having a dream about Ms McCarthy and said she remained a ""very attractive woman"", according to Ms McCarthy."
2017-11-11,"On 11 November 1920, King George V acted as Chief Mourner at the funeral of the First World War's Unknown Warrior.Â ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171111230455/https://news.sky.com/story/queens-small-change-of-custom-on-remembrance-day-11121739,"The procession stopped at the new Cenotaph, or emblematic 'empty tomb', which completely caught the grieving nation's mood, and the King laid his wreath of white flowers on the memorial. And Sir Edwin Lutyen's simple stone memorial remains the focus of the UK's annual salute. Ever since 1920, in what became known as the National Act of Remembrance, each monarch has gathered the political and military leaders of our nation to reflect upon the high cost of peace, freedom and democracy. The Queen has maintained this tradition throughout her reign and, with her signature adherence to form and proper order, it's one of those moments of unmissable certainty in the Royal calendar by which our watches of routine can be set. Only occasionally have circumstances conspired to prevent Her Majesty from doing this duty in person. This year too, she will continue this symbolic act - but, this time, she will not step into the parade but watch from a balcony. For the first time in her 65-year reign she will be present but not lay her own wreath. This small change of custom has caught the attention of many, though I doubt many can be greatly surprised. Rather than stand alone, in front of her family, in the centre of Whitehall waiting for the moment to take hold of her traditional but enormous wreath, Her Majesty will watch from the balcony as Prince Charles does it for her. The Queen is 91 now and carrying a wreath up steps to stand against the stone is not without physical challenge. Stopping this duty must only surprise people for the fact she did not elect to stop doing it a decade ago. Instead, she will watch from balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office building and, as Prince Charles places it atop the step and takes a pace back to salute, the Queen will bow in debt to the Fallen. This is what Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother always did. For half a century, this Royal widow would hold a studied gaze of reflection, seemingly lost in memories: possibly of her war leader husband, George VI, or her older brother, Fergus, who was killed at the Battle of Loos in 1915. Meanwhile, she watched as her Scottish Equerry, who wasn't that much younger than her, stepped forward to put down her wreath. On Sunday, it will be an Equerry who will do this for The Duke of Edinburgh. This will happen immediately after the Prince of Wales has placed the Queen's and before he returns to place his own iconic one, which is dominated with the three feathers badge of the Heir Apparent. Throughout Sunday's brief ceremony, the Queen will be where she wanted to be, beside her husband. We know why the Queen has made this decision this year. She is 91 and Prince Philip is well into his 97th year. This summer marked the end of his public life but Remembrance is one of those iconic annual ceremonies that both seem set on attending together. After all, the Queen and Prince Philip represent the wartime generation that fought and won freedom in the Second World War. They continue to represent the generation of our parents, or grandparents, that heard the sirens and bombers over our cities, served in the Armed Services and must have endured the loss of countless friends. After they will watch as their four children and two of their grandchildren add tributes to the gradual cascade of poppies around the Cenotaph's base. Then the Queen's 13th Prime Minister, Theresa May, will lay the Government's wreath, as Churchill did at the start of her reign and as Lloyd George did at the first of these ceremonies in 1920. The nations of the Commonwealth then help to complete the circle of poppy red and, in so doing their names remind us all what 'world war' really meant, as all these far flung countries were then part of Britain's old empire. Having stepped onto her balcony vantage point at seconds to 11am, just 25 minutes later the Queen will bow a second time to the Cenotaph before withdrawing to return home. Thousands of veterans, some from the Second World War and also in their 90s, will then march past this square of emblematic white stone and leave it further anointed with their memories, salute and tributes of poppy red.

She was facing calls to speak out after Mr Salmond announced a weekly current affairs programme to air on RT, formerly known as Russia Today. The former SNP leader, who lost his seat at the 2017 General Election, had already faced anger and mockery from other politicians for the decision. An MSP from his own party reportedly asked ""what the f*** is he thinking?"", while the Conservative MP who unseated him from the Gordon constituency in June said the move ""will suit his politics"". Scottish Tories leader Ruth Davidson also accused him of ""taking the Kremlin's rouble"". Ms Sturgeon joined the fray in a statement on Friday, saying while she was sure the programme would be interesting viewing, ""his choice of channel would not have been my choice"". She cautioned: ""Of course, Alex is not currently an elected politician and is free to do as he wishes - but had I been asked, I would have advised against RT and suggested he seek a different channel to air what I am sure will be an entertaining show. ""Neither myself nor the SNP will shy away from criticising Russian policy when we believe it is merited."" Mr Salmond has promised he will not bow to Russian editorial interference, saying he is simply making the show and selling it on to RT. He claims it is up to the broadcaster whether they run the shows or not. ""This programme will give people with something to say a platform to say it, and we intend to find out something about the personalities behind the public figures,"" Mr Salmond said."
2017-11-11,Uber has lost an appeal against a landmark ruling on the employment rights of its drivers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171111230455/https://news.sky.com/story/uber-loses-appeal-over-workers-rights-court-ruling-11120723,"Two drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, won a case against the ride-hailing app last year after arguing they were workers and entitled to the minimum wage, sick pay, paid holiday and breaks. During its failed attempt to overturn the decision at the Employment Appeal Tribunal in London, Uber claimed the ruling could deprive drivers of the ""personal flexibility they value"". The company, which is also battling Transport for London over its licence to operate in the capital, said it would appeal against Friday's judgment. In a statement, it said: ""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed. ""The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal."" Mr Farrar, 49, said he was ""really disappointed"" over Uber's intention to appeal, adding it had ""an army of lawyers paid for by exploiting labour"". The driver added: ""We can't give up because the case law is so important now that if we give up and give this victory to Uber, then the battle will be so much harder for everybody else that comes after us - not just Uber drivers, but people right across the economy. ""Because if Uber gets away with this, then everywhere you turn in Britain, industrial Britain, you'll have people under this sort of fake self-employed conditions, carrying all the risk of the business with no worker rights."" Calling on Uber to ""throw in the towel"", TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""No company, however big or well-connected, is above the law. ""Uber must play by the rules and stop denying its drivers basic rights at work. This ruling should put gig economy employers on notice."" Last month, Uber filed an appeal against a decision by TfL to deny it a licence to operate in London. TfL said the taxi-hailing app had demonstrated ""a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications"". Uber employs 40,000 drivers in the capital and can continue to operate until that appeal process is complete. While some drivers have criticised Uber's structure, others say the app gives them the chance to work when they like. ""Every driver I know who uses the app does not want to be a worker for Uber,"" driver Ben Tino told Sky News. ""We want to remain independent - it's the reason why we all signed up in the first place."" He added: ""I really hope that Uber goes on to win this case otherwise it would be a disaster for the drivers who actually use the app. ""Uber has transformed the private hire industry for the better."""
2017-11-11,A life-size figure of Hitler standing against a backdrop of Auschwitz concentration camp has been removed from an Indonesian waxwork museum following international outrage.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171111230455/https://news.sky.com/story/hitler-selfie-display-at-waxwork-museum-sparks-outrage-11121849,"The museum in the city of Yogyakarta had allowed visitors to take selfies next to the display since 2014. The museum's marketing officer defended it in recent days after condemnation from human rights groups. ""No visitors complained about it,"" he said. ""Most of our visitors are having fun because they know this is just an entertainment museum... Let people judge whether the character is good or bad."" However, the De Mata Trick Eye Museum confirmed on Saturday that the display had been removed. ""We don't want to attract outrage,"" said operations manager Jamie Misbah. ""Our purpose to display the Hitler figure in the museum is to educate."" The exhibit had been positioned next to a figure of Darth Vader and opposite a waxwork of Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Human Rights Watch had called the exhibit ""sickening"" and prominent anti-Semitism group The Simon Wiesenthal Centre demanded it be taken down. ""Everything about it is wrong. It's hard to find words for how contemptible it is,"" said the centre's Rabbi Abraham Cooper. ""The background is disgusting. It mocks the victims who went in and never came out."" Almost a million Jews were murdered at Auschwitz after being rounded up from around Europe and herded unaware into the gas chambers. The museum's display featured the Auschwitz entrance with the infamous slogan ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" (""Work Sets You Free""). A Nazi-themed cafe, where waiters wore SS uniforms and pictures of Hitler adorned the walls, also closed in the Indonesian city of Bandung in January. It came after years of controversy and reported death threats against the owner. Human Rights Watch Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono said the Nazi exhibits showed anti-Jewish sentiment in the world's biggest Muslim nation was more widespread than thought. Mr Harsono said the Israel-Palestine situation had fed anti-Jewish feelings in the country for decades. Historians have also pointed to a lack of education in Indonesia about the horrors of the Holocaust and the persecution of the Jews during the war."
2017-11-11,"As the allegations keep coming thick and fast, the atmosphere in Westminster is febrile.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171111230455/https://news.sky.com/story/sex-pest-scandal-engulfing-westminster-worse-than-expenses-11112503,"I've heard senior figures in both major parties warning darkly that this is worse than the expenses scandal which rocked British politics in 2009. It certainly has many similar elements - a oversight regime which was revealed to be not fit for purpose, a drip-drip of allegations turning into a flood, and the risk that all MPs will be tarred as sex pests due to the behaviour of a small number. :: Fallon quit after No 10 told of sex assault claim The veteran Conservative MP Gary Streeter hit an unwelcome nerve for many in his party when he warned on Twitter that this felt like the John Major years - ""no majority, no money, ripping ourselves apart over the EU. That lasted five years. Oh dear"". Twenty years later, there are fears in the party that yet again the Conservatives could again be riven apart on Europe and then destroyed by sleaze. It's hard to believe that this barely began a week ago, when it was reported in a newspaper that a Whatsapp group of female Parliamentary staff were sharing experiences about inappropriate behaviour. Within days the scandal had reached Theresa May's government with the trade minister Mark Garnier the first to be accused and defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday, the first scalp to be claimed. :: A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline Few in the Conservative party now think his resignation will be the last, in a scandal which threatens to derail not just the reputation of politics, but the delicate Cabinet balance Mrs May relies on to keep her fragile administration together. That her key ally, the de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green is under investigation over claims by the writer Kate Maltby that he touched her knee and wrote her an inappropriate text message, will be a source of worry to No 10. Developments in the Labour party are if anything even more serious, with the allegation by activist Bex Bailey that she was raped by a senior party figure and advised against reporting it by party officials. NEC member Jasmin Beckett has told Sky News that more victims were waiting in the wings, and called on her party to help them come forward. Allegations have already resulted in the suspension of Corbyn ally Kelvin Hopkins, 76, over claims - stringently denied - that he inappropriately touched an activist 50 years his junior; and an investigation into Clive Lewis, who denies he groped a woman at the party's conference. Both men served in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. In fact Mr Hopkins was promoted to shadow culture secretary last summer, months after the leader's office was made aware that he had been reprimanded for sending the activist a suggestive text message. The senior Labour MPs, as well as Mr Green, are adamant that the allegations are untrue, and Mr Lewis even accused his accuser of lying. There is deep anger in Westminster at the way these allegations are coming out because, at least in part as a result of the failure of the political parties' processes, victims are instead going public before due process can take place. A list of around 40 Conservative MPs compiled by party staff, and circulating on social media, has been blamed for muddying the waters between MPs having affairs or relationships with colleagues; along with unsubstantiated accusations of harassment. Some MPs on the list have already come out to denounce the claims as lies, such as the Penrith MP Rory Stewart, whose researcher has backed him up. But as both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn scramble to get a grip on the scandal, events are moving fast. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party on Friday night and serious allegations referred to the police, responded angrily that the media were told about his suspension before he was and that he was not aware of the claim. The Prime Minister has issued a new code of conduct and allegations hotline for all representatives of her party, and the Labour leader said an independent specialist organisation would be appointed to handle complaints in the future. Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the ""dam has broken"" in Westminster, according to Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who said it was time for the ""male-dominated professionsâ¦where the boys' own locker room culture has prevailed"" to clean up. Westminster is not a normal work environment. MPs hire their own staff - often plucked from thousands who want to work at the heart of politics - and those staff can expect a different work culture depending on whether their boss is a 30-year-old, who has come from a career in business, or a 70-year-old, who has been in politics for decades. Drinking and socialising in Parliament's bars, but also away on by-elections and party conferences, can be part and parcel. Few MPs doubt that this is a watershed moment for the behaviour of parliamentarians and how Westminster is scrutinised. It is hoped that higher standards of conduct will eventually result. But as with expenses, things could get a lot worse before they get better."

James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the UK Government is ready to be ""pragmatic"" in acquiring a solution to the ""unique circumstances"" facing the nation, regarding its currently open border with the EU. Mr Varadkar's suggestion came after a leaked European Commission document said the Republic is making a big push for firm reassurance on the border question before the crucial EU summit in December when Theresa May is hoping to get the go-ahead for trade talks to begin. The paper, obtained by the Daily Telegraph, said to preserve the Good Friday Agreement peace deal the Brexit deal must respect ""the integrity of the internal market and the customs union"". Northern Ireland's border is one of the three key initial Brexit issues, along with expat citizens' rights and the divorce bill. EU leaders have said ""sufficient progress"" must be made on all three topics before the remaining 27 leaders will give the go-ahead for trade talks. :: Government wants no physical changes to Irish border arrangements Mr Varadkar told the British-Irish Council summit in Jersey he was ""loath to comment in too much detail on papers that have been leaked to the media"". He added: ""When it comes to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, what we have all agreed to is that there shouldn't be a hard border, there should be no physical infrastructure along that border and that there should be no return to the borders of the past. ""It is our view, and has been our view for a very long time, that the only way that can be achieved is if the United Kingdom as a whole, or Northern Ireland, continues to apply the rules of the customs union and the single market. ""That doesn't mean that they have to be members of it, but it would mean continuing to apply the rules of the single market and the customs union. ""That's the position that we hold and the best way to achieve our common objectives."" Mr Brokenshire said Mrs May had been clear the UK will no longer be a member of the single market and the customs union when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Mr Varadkar added: ""We are looking for a bespoke solution here that achieves the objective that we all share, which is no hard border, no return to the borders of the past and no physical infrastructure along that border."" During another speech later on Friday, the first to his party since becoming Taoiseach, he vowed to safeguard the rights of border communities. He said he was certain Ireland will remain at the heart of Europe."

Mr Sandness had put a rifle below his chin and pulled the trigger in Wyoming in 2006, destroying most of his face. He withdrew from contact with other people after facial surgery left him severely disfigured - with a quarter-sized nose and a prosthetic nose, which subsequently fell off. But he was given hope when he made it onto a waiting list for the Mayo Clinic's face transplant programme in 2016 - and Mrs Ross agreed to donate her husband's face. Her husband, Calen, shot himself and died in southwestern Minnesota in 2016. The two men's ages, blood type, skin colour and facial structure were such a near-perfect match that Mr Sandness' surgeon, Dr Samir Mardini, said they could have been cousins. The successful surgery has allowed Mr Sandness to chew food properly again and helped him win promotion in his work as an oilfield electrician. Mrs Ross said she had been worried about the meeting bringing back reminders of her husband. But without the same eyes, forehead and strong cheeks, she was relieved to find Mr Sandness looked quite different. The pair wept as they hugged for the first time, and Mr Sandness spent time playing with Mr Ross' son Leonard. Mr Sandness said he had felt ""a lot of emotion"" at the meeting. He said: ""You're happy, at the same time you're sad because you know that they've lost somebody that meant a lot to them.

Mrs Ross said: ""With meeting Andy, it has finally given me closure on how everything happened because it just, everything happened so fast and it was just it was hard.

The 36-year-old was sent off before the start of a Europa League tie in Portugal earlier this month for appearing to kick a Marseille supporter who had apparently verbally abused him. Evra, who was one of Marseille's substitutes for the match at Vitoria Guimaraes, seemed to get into an altercation with some of his own team's fans as he walked along the touchline with team-mates prior to kick off. Video showed him appearing to aim a kick at one of several Marseille supporters who had seemingly scaled barriers to reach the advertising hoardings. UEFA banned the full-back from all European club football until 30 June and fined him â¬10,000 (Â£8,825). Marseille, who were fined â¬25,000 (Â£22,000) for a pitch invasion by fans, criticised both player and supporters who, it claimed, insulted Evra. In a statement on its website, Marseille said Evra ""committed an irreparable act by responding to provocations from a handful of individuals. Nothing justified such a reaction, especially from a senior player. ""In that context...both parties agreed to end the collaboration by mutual consent. ""This incident also highlighted the unacceptable attitude of a small number of people who uttered insults and threats of violence towards the player and his family before contemptuously invading the pitch. ""Such behaviour, which exposes the club to sanctions, has no place in the stands of a football stadium and at Marseille in particular,"" it said. The incident carried echoes of Eric Cantona's infamous ""kung-fu"" kick on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons in 1995. The Manchester United striker was banned for nine months from football worldwide and ordered to do 120 hours of community service."

""He was the film's director, Brett Ratner."" ""He 'outed' me with no regard for my well-being, an act we all recognise as homophobic."" In a long Facebook post, Page claimed the director said degrading things to other actors, and condemned an ""epidemic"" of violence against women that shuns victims and celebrates the continuing careers of perpetrators. The actress, also known for her role in Inception, said that at the time of Ratner's alleged remark ""I was a young adult who had not yet come out to myself."" ""This public, aggressive outing left me with long standing feelings of shame,"" Page said. ""Making someone feel ashamed of who they are is a cruel manipulation, designed to oppress and repress."" Ratner, who also directed, produced or financed blockbuster films including The Revenant and Rush Hour, was accused of misconduct by six women, including actress Olivia Munn, in a Los Angeles Times article earlier this month. He has categorically denied the allegations detailed in the LA Times, and has not addressed Page's accusations. As well as claims against Ratner, Page's post details what the actress claims were incidents of harassment, including sexual assault, which took place when she was 16.

Mr Brokenshire said Mrs May had been clear the UK will no longer be a member of the single market and the customs union when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Mr Varadkar added: ""We are looking for a bespoke solution here that achieves the objective that we all share, which is no hard border, no return to the borders of the past and no physical infrastructure along that border."" During another speech later on Friday, the first to his party since becoming Taoiseach, he vowed to safeguard the rights of border communities. He said he was certain Ireland will remain at the heart of Europe."
2017-11-12,"Kerry McCarthy says she suffered unwanted attention from fellow Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins spanning 20 years and found it ""upsetting"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171112234150/https://news.sky.com/story/mp-kerry-mccarthy-says-kelvin-hopkins-dreamt-about-her-in-upsetting-letter-11121571,"The former shadow environment secretary is the first MP to make specific claims of inappropriate behaviour since the Westminster scandal erupted. Ms McCarthy said the Luton North MP sent her a series of letters and cards about her appearance, including one in which he described having a dream about her. But Mr Hopkins said Ms McCarthy's complaint had caused him ""immense personal hurt and utter dismay"" from someone he counted as a friend. He added: ""I cannot understand why a Parliamentarian of such experience and standing, who is also such a long term friend, would not have told me that she was unhappy with any aspect of our friendship rather than going straight to the national press. ""At a minimum I would have expected a Parliamentary colleague to raise any complaint through normal channels, allowing me due process and a fair chance to defend myself, if necessary."" Ms McCarthy said she decided to go public after activist Ava Etemadzadeh complained last week about the behaviour of Mr Hopkins. He was suspended by Labour after Ms Etemadzadeh contacted the party again with fresh information following an initial complaint over dealings with the MP in 2014 and 2015. Mr Hopkins was reprimanded at the time by the-then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton but was appointed shadow culture secretary in 2016. He ""categorically denies"" any inappropriate conduct in relation to Ms Etemadzadeh. Ms McCarthy, 52, first met Mr Hopkins, 76, when she was in her late 20s and they were both involved in Labour politics in her home town of Luton. In 1994, when she was chairwoman of Luton North constituency Labour Party (CLP) and he chaired Luton South CLP, they went out for lunch, with Ms McCarthy believing it was to discuss political issues. He later sent her a card saying he had invited her ""because you are attractive, intelligent and charming"" before urging her to ""dispose"" of the note, she said. In a second note, Mr Hopkins enclosed a photo of Ms McCarthy and described her as ""pretty"" before again asking her to dispose of it, she claimed. He also sent a postcard, which appears to be dated 1996, in an envelope to her place of work, asking whether her employer specialised in ""pretty, petite brunettes"". Ms McCarthy said she went to another lunch with Mr Hopkins because she found it awkward to say no to the invitation. He sent a card afterwards suggesting it ""would be nice to meet again"". On another occasion, also believed to be in 1996, Ms McCarthy said Mr Hopkins placed his hand on hers when she was not looking as she was getting out of a car. A note sent in the run-up to the 1997 general election said: ""You know I think you are lovely ... but I never see enough of you ... after May 1st perhaps ... K x."" The letters then stopped until her 50th birthday, when Mr Hopkins sent a note on parliamentary writing paper to mark the occasion. By this time Ms McCarthy was an MP. A final letter was sent some time in 2015/16 but it is not clear if it was written after he was reprimanded for the incident involving Ms Etemadzadeh. In it, he described having a dream about Ms McCarthy and said she remained a ""very attractive woman"", according to Ms McCarthy."

However, the family of Mr Sargeant, 49, said asking the Permanent Secretary to start preparations for a probe meant it would not be truly independent. In a statement they said: ""The inquiry must be established by a body that is fully independent of Welsh Government. ""The Permanent Secretary reports directly to the First Minister and is therefore not independent. ""We believe that a truly independent body must also be responsible for agreeing the terms of reference and appointing the chair and secretariat for the inquiry."" Mr Sargeant is believed to have killed himself four days after being suspended from the Labour Party and removed from his role as cabinet secretary for communities and children following claims of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". A spokesman for Mr Jones said: ""Further to the First Minister's comments yesterday about the need for independent scrutiny of his actions and decisions in relation to Carl Sargeant, he agrees that there should be an independent inquiry and it would be proper to ask a senior QC to lead that work. ""To ensure this happens separately from his office, the First Minister has asked the Permanent Secretary to begin preparatory work for this inquiry."" But Mr Sargeant's family said there were ""serious failings"" with the handling of the case. They also said a coroner's inquest would not be able to unveil the complete picture. They said: ""An independent inquiry will ask all the questions that need to be asked and have not been answered and will determine the reasons for the serious failings in following the correct procedures, practices and protocols, and the reasons for the complete abdication of responsibility and duty of care that was owed to Carl."" It comes after former minister Leighton Andrews claimed Mr Jones knew his colleague was ""fragile"" before sacking him. He also spoke of a ""toxic"" atmosphere in government rife with ""minor bullying, mind-games, power-games and favouritism"". Friday's announcement comes following pressure from Welsh Tory leader Andrew Davies, who also called for an inquiry into the culture within government."
2017-11-12,"One thing Marks and Spencer has been excellent at during recent years, whatever you think of it as a retailer, has been its ability to downplay City expectations ahead of publication of its results.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171112234150/https://news.sky.com/story/how-will-ms-measure-up-as-changes-accelerate-11118775,"The latest were no exception. The market had been primed for half year pre-tax profits, on an underlying basis, of Â£200m. An outturn of Â£219.1m, then, came as a pleasant surprise to investors, even if it did represent a drop of 5.3% on the same period last year. There was another pleasant surprise in the clothing performance - long the Achilles heel for M&S. :: M&S signals more store closures in shake-up Total clothing and home sales during the most recent quarter were actually up 0.6% on the same period last year while, on a like-for-like basis (which measures sales in stores trading in the same format for the last year or more) they were down by a mere 0.1%. That was better than most M&S-watchers had been expecting. There are growing indications that the decline in clothing has been stemmed and Steve Rowe, the chief executive, could point to the fact that M&S has cut the number of sales in clothing and home from nine to four while also cutting back on promotions. That is showing up in further improvement in margins. That was the good - or, at least, the reasonably positive - news. More disappointing was the admission that like-for-like sales of food, undoubtedly the strongest card for M&S during the last decade, fell by 0.1% both during the latest quarter and during the first half of the year as a whole. Total food sales were up by 4.4%, reflecting new store openings, but Mr Rowe was warning ominously about the ""headwinds facing our food business"" having ""intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". Accordingly, while Mr Rowe insists ""investment returns remain high"", the company is reining back on expansion of its popular Simply Food chain. It is not difficult to detect the hand of Archie Norman, the new M&S chairman, in either this decision or in the departure of Helen Weir, the chief financial officer, whose exit was first reported last night by Sky's Mark Kleinman. Mr Norman, who succeeded the urbane former investment banker Robert Swannell in September, is a hard-driving turnaround expert still revered in the City for the way, a quarter of a century ago, he and Allan Leighton rescued Asda from collapse before selling it to Wal-Mart for Â£6.7bn in 1999. Most sector-watchers who know him reckon Mr Norman will be pushing the likeable Mr Rowe to accelerate the pace of change at M&S and in particular the speed at which the retailer brings down its costs. As M&S seeks to place greater emphasis on its digital sales, Mr Rowe had previously announced plans to close 30 of its larger stores, but insists now that was the ""minimum"" and that M&S would ""go faster"" in closing underperforming stores. The company confirmed that, by 2022, it will have 60 fewer stores than it did in 2016 - yet many will question whether it could not be reducing its space by more. By then, meanwhile, M&S aims to be making a third of its sales online. Other questions remain. One is over Mr Rowe's recent appointment of Jill McDonald as head of clothing and home. Ms McDonald is well-regarded, due to successful stints as managing director of McDonald's UK and as chief executive of Halfords, but some investors worry about her lack of specific experience in fashion, particularly as her appointment triggered the departure of the former head of clothing, Jo Jenkins. The concern is understandable. Fashion, particularly women's fashion, is the fulcrum of M&S. Get that right and absolutely everything else follows. Ever since the late Sir Richard Greenbury retired nearly 19 years ago, M&S has had a string of leaders - Peter Salsbury, Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes, Sir Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland - who have all grappled with trying to either stem decline or revive the group's fortunes. That said, in Mr Norman and Mr Rowe, M&S probably has as good a combination of chairman and chief executive as it could hope for in seeking to achieve the latter. In Mr Norman, it has someone who will agitate for rapid and even radical change, but who also boasts experience of transforming a low-growth retailer into a high-growth one. In Mr Rowe, meanwhile, it has someone who has spent almost his entire career at M&S, who is steeped in its values, who loves the business, who understands its staff and customers and who can use that as potent weapons in driving change. As demonstrated by the warm response to its Christmas advertisements featuring Paddington Bear, there is still massive public goodwill towards M&S, probably greater than any other retailer enjoys with the possible exception of John Lewis. That is a fabulous platform on which to build."

2017-11-12,The Queen watched on for the first time in her 65-year reign as Prince Charles led Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph in Whitehall.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171112234150/https://news.sky.com/story/remembrance-sunday-uk-falls-silent-to-honour-war-dead-11123476,"In a break with tradition, Prince Charles laid the head of state's wreath at the base of the monument shortly after a two-minute silence at 11am. The Queen appeared to wipe away a tear as she watched the service from a Foreign Office balcony with the Duke of Edinburgh and Duchess of Cornwall. The change of protocol is seen as one of the Queen's most significant handovers of Royal responsibilities to the heir to the throne. Placing the wreath at the base of the Whitehall monument would have required the monarch, who is 91, to walk backwards down the stone steps. As well as laying the head of state's wreath, Charles laid his own wreath at the base of the Cenotaph. The Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry, the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Kent also laid wreaths. Charles has stepped in for the Queen at the ceremony twice before - in 1983 when she was in Kenya and in 1999 when the monarch travelled to South Africa. Across the rest of the country, millions honoured Britain's war dead at other Remembrance Day commemorations. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire and DUP leader Arlene Foster laid wreaths at the cenotaph in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh - 30 years since an IRA bombing there killed 12 on Remembrance Sunday. Meanwhile, a suspicious object found close to a war memorial in Omagh, County Tyrone, was a viable pipe bomb device, say police. It has been taken away by officers for further examination. PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: ""This small but potentially dangerous device was left to cause the maximum amount of disruption to the Remembrance Sunday commemorations. ""This is the action of a small and callous group of violent people who have nothing to offer our communities other than fear and intimidation."" The alert forced the diversion of a parade and the cancellation of wreath-laying. In August 1998, a Real IRA bombing in Omagh claimed 29 lives and was the biggest single atrocity during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. On Saturday, the Queen and senior royals joined servicemen and women past and present at the annual Festival of Remembrance as the nation remembered its war dead on Armistice Day. The monarch was joined at the Royal Albert Hall in London by thousands of veterans for the 90th anniversary of the event, organised by the Royal British Legion, of which she is patron."

The patients, ranging in age from 52 to 94, lived in or had travelled to Anaheim, where the theme park is based, and nine had visited Disneyland in September. One patient ""with additional health issues"", who had not visited the park, has died, health officials said. There have been no new cases of the disease linked to Anaheim since September. Disneyland was informed of the cases on 27 October. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, confirmed that two cooling towers had been shut down and treated with chemicals. They will remain offline until tests confirm they are free from contamination. The cooling towers provide cold water for various uses at Disneyland, such as refrigeration but not for drinking water, and give off a vapour or mist that could have carried the Legionnella bacteria. Ms Hymel said that health officials had assured the company that there was no longer any risk to guests or employees of the park. Legionnaires' disease can be spread through inhaling droplets from contaminated water sources. While many people have no symptoms, it can cause serious pneumonia and prove dangerous to those with lung or immune system problems. The disease, which is not contagious, can be treated with antibiotics. Disneyland, California, which opened in 1955, attracts tens of thousands of visitors a day and is owned by The Walt Disney Company."

The British driver tweeted: ""This is so upsetting to hear. Please say a prayer for my guys who are here as professionals today even if shaken. ""This happens every single year here. F1 and the teams need to do more, there's no excuse!"" In a statement, Mercedes said: ""Valuables were stolen but everybody is safe and uninjured which is the main thing."" At the time of the robbery, Mercedes' world-championship winning team were returning back to their hotel after preparing for Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix. Staff from the FIA, the sport's governing body, and the Williams F1 team are believed to have escaped similar incidents on Friday night. It is not the first time the Brazilian Grand Prix has been marred by threats against F1 teams and drivers. In 2010, a car carrying former McLaren driver Jenson Button was approached by three gunmen near Interlagos circuit. Button described his driver as a ""legend"" after he managed to get the Briton to safety by fleeing through traffic. Button said: ""We got in between six cars to get past and got away. Looking behind there were two guys with a handgun and one guy with what looked like a machine gun. ""It was a pretty scary situation - it's not a very comfortable feeling, not great."""

In the past, he has referred to him as ""Little Rocket Man"". Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ""old,"" when I would NEVER call him ""short and fat?"" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen! :: Meryl Streep During her Golden Globes speech, the Hollywood star accused the President of bullying behaviour. But Mr Trump said he was unimpressed with Streep, one of the most successful actresses of her generation. Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a..... Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never ""mocked"" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him....... ""groveling"" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media! :: Arnold Schwarzenegger Schwarzenegger replaced the President as host of the Celebrity Apprentice reality show, but then said he was leaving. Mr Trump was not a fan - just one incident of a long-running feud between the men. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show :: Whoopi Goldberg Goldberg, who presents US show The View, criticised Mr Trump on air for racially-charged comments he had made during his presidential campaign. He responded by sharing his opinions on daytime television scheduling. The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad! :: Macy's Mr Trump's attack on Macy's was prompted by the department store's decision to drop the Trump menswear brand from their stores - after a campaign-trail speech portraying Mexicans as murderers and rapists. I hope the boycott of @Macys continues forever. So many people are cutting up their cards. Macy's stores suck and they are bad for U.S.A. :: Hillary Clinton In retweeting - and then deleting - a GIF of himself knocking what appears to be Hillary Clinton to the floor with a golf ball, Mr Trump raised serious questions over his attitudes toward violence against women. He also routinely refers to his former presidential rival as Crooked Hillary. Donald Trump's amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary pic.twitter.com/vKhxxFCBV1 :: Ted Cruz Few things underpin the gravity of accusations of misconduct more than a Jim Carrey movie, and to really highlight the importance of his concerns Mr Trump photoshopped Ted Cruz's head onto a movie poster. Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. https://t.co/ESdiEftWGs :: CNN Observers were dumbfounded by a Tweet, adapted from a past appearance on WrestleMania, that appeared to show Mr Trump attacking the CNN logo in a sinister realisation of his ""fake news"" crusade. #FraudNewsCNN #FNN pic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg :: Mika Brzezinski Mr Trump has long harboured a grudge against the presenters of TV show Morning Joe. But his particularly gendered insult toward host Mika Brzesinski raised alarm bells even with some from his own party. I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.. ...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no! :: Hamilton When the cast of the popular musical addressed Vice President Mike Pence, who was in the audience, he responded by saying he'd enjoyed the show. But the that didn't stop Mr Trump taking issue with the criticism online. The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior :: Honorary mention While not an attack on anybody, this was one of Mr Trump's most baffling tweets. It has since been deleted, but not before giving rise to endless speculation - and mockery - online."

In a statement posted on the zoo's Facebook page a spokesman said: ""I would like to make it clear to everyone ... that the decision to kill her was not ours and we in no way agreed to or participated in the shooting of our baby lynx. ""We are truly devastated and outraged that this happened."" Numerous attempts had been made to recapture Lillith since her escape, and at one stage a police helicopter was also brought in to help.

""We are an island nation, nobody can deny that, it is the Year of the Royal Navy. We need to retain a balanced fleet that meets the capabilities and demands of the 21st century and that includes a form of amphibious capability. There is no denying that sends a powerful message to the world. ""It is not a revolution. We continue to evolve our force structure to match the threats we face and an amphibious capability is part of that force structure."" The combination of a weak pound, a failure to make efficiencies and expensive equipment programmes running over-budget, has meant the MoD must find immediate savings of around Â£5bn. It has been speculated that up to 1,000 Royal Marines could lose their jobs and the Royal Navy's two amphibious ships scrapped, leaving the Armed Forces unable to storm enemy beaches from the sea. Asked if he could give any reassurance to those families worried about job losses, Sir Stuart said: ""We've not yet made any decisions. We continue to strive for efficiencies. ""It's fair to say we need to look at the ways we operate. We are in a position where we are considering our response to a darkening threat, we are looking at the way we modernise and adapt."" Channelling words used by Sir Winston Churchill the former Chief of the Defence Staff spoke about the growing threat to national security. ""There is a gathering storm the combination of the expression of terrorism across the globe, with state-on-state competition which is the reality before us, with the outlaw activity by regimes such as the North Korean regime, then you can see that sense of darkness."" In a wide-ranging interview, Sir Stuart also spoke about the importance of remembrance and understanding history. Asked his opinion on the new Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, he said he was ""very impressed"". Mr Williamson was promoted into the senior Cabinet role last week when Sir Michael Fallon resigned after accusations of sexual harassment. The allegations have continued to emerge from the political corridors of Westminster but Sir Stuart said he was confident the British military is a safe place to serve. ""The Armed Forces have a strict code of conduct they have strict methods of investigation, and so I think I can be very confident that we continue to modernise and adapt as an armed force, and our approach to diversity and inclusion very much reflects that process of modernisation."" He wouldn't reveal whether the military is reviewing its reporting processes in light of events in Westminster and Hollywood, saying only that he is ""very confident in our processes""."

Witnesses say some of the victims were executed on the side of the pit and pushed inside, while others were thrown in alive. Underground water flows are thought to have washed many of the bodies away, and parts of the sinkhole filled in. ""They would bring them and make them get out and line up at the edge of the hole ...and then they would execute them,"" resident Mohammed Younis said. ""And the bodies would all fall into the hole."" ""I remember one incident when they brought some women. They brought them in a minibus. ""They took them out of the minibus, three women, two young ladies and an elderly woman, and there was an old man with them. ""They brought them, executed them and threw their bodies in the hole. ""I went to them and asked, 'Who were they?' And they said, 'They were informing on us to the security forces.'"" Mr Younis said the militants went on to fill the hole with cars and sand.

The city had been in the hands of Islamic State militants since 2014. A UN human rights report said IS carried out mass abductions and killings, and used civilians as human shields. Iraqis have been trying to access the sinkhole for months, but have been prevented from reaching it by landmines that scatter the land surrounding it. In March, Fawaz Abdelabbas, the deputy head of the International Commission for Missing Persons in Iraq, told Sky News that he hoped to identify bodies of the people who had been thrown into the hole.

2017-11-12,"Jeremy Corbyn has launched a furious attack on Boris Johnson, calling for the Foreign Secretary to be sacked for ""putting our citizens at risk"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171112234150/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-boris-johnson-to-quit-over-heartbreaking-iran-comment-11123381,"The Labour leader said his appeal was motivated by the ""heartbreaking"" case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British woman jailed in Iran. He told The Observer that Mr Johnson was ""undermining our country with his incompetence"" by refusing to apologise for comments that could extend the detained Briton's sentence. Mr Corbyn said the ""embarrassing"" behaviour, coupled with the Foreign Secretary's ""colonial throwback"" attitude meant he should resign. ""It's time for him to go,"" the Labour leader said. It comes as the focus shifts from former International Development Secretary Priti Patel on to Mr Johnson, who said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been ""teaching people journalism"" in Tehran, despite her family and employer's insistence she was on holiday. The comment was reported as an ""unintended confession"" by Iranian state TV, and raised fears her jail term might increase as a result. Mr Johnson at first refused to apologise, but later said he was sorry if his remarks about the British-Iranian mother caused her family anxiety. Brexit Secretary David Davis defended his Cabinet colleague, telling Sky's Sunday with Niall Paterson: ""Why would you want to sack him? He's a good Foreign Secretary. ""The thing to understand here - you've got a flurry at the 'Continued on page five, continued from page one' moment of things happening in politics, but this happens to all governments at some point or other."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard, has told Sky News he is in contact with senior politicians over the case, and is expected to meet Mr Johnson on Sunday. Environment Secretary Michael Gove also on Sunday sparked questions over the charity worker's fate by appearing uncertain over why she was in Iran. Asked what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Tehran when she was arrested and detained in 2016, he admitted: ""I don't know."""
2017-11-12,"On 11 November 1920, King George V acted as Chief Mourner at the funeral of the First World War's Unknown Warrior.Â ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171112234150/https://news.sky.com/story/queens-small-change-of-custom-on-remembrance-day-11121739,"The procession stopped at the new Cenotaph, or emblematic 'empty tomb', which completely caught the grieving nation's mood, and the King laid his wreath of white flowers on the memorial. And Sir Edwin Lutyen's simple stone memorial remains the focus of the UK's annual salute. Ever since 1920, in what became known as the National Act of Remembrance, each monarch has gathered the political and military leaders of our nation to reflect upon the high cost of peace, freedom and democracy. The Queen has maintained this tradition throughout her reign and, with her signature adherence to form and proper order, it's one of those moments of unmissable certainty in the Royal calendar by which our watches of routine can be set. Only occasionally have circumstances conspired to prevent Her Majesty from doing this duty in person. This year too, she will continue this symbolic act - but, this time, she will not step into the parade but watch from a balcony. For the first time in her 65-year reign she will be present but not lay her own wreath. This small change of custom has caught the attention of many, though I doubt many can be greatly surprised. Rather than stand alone, in front of her family, in the centre of Whitehall waiting for the moment to take hold of her traditional but enormous wreath, Her Majesty will watch from the balcony as Prince Charles does it for her. The Queen is 91 now and carrying a wreath up steps to stand against the stone is not without physical challenge. Stopping this duty must only surprise people for the fact she did not elect to stop doing it a decade ago. Instead, she will watch from balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office building and, as Prince Charles places it atop the step and takes a pace back to salute, the Queen will bow in debt to the Fallen. This is what Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother always did. For half a century, this Royal widow would hold a studied gaze of reflection, seemingly lost in memories: possibly of her war leader husband, George VI, or her older brother, Fergus, who was killed at the Battle of Loos in 1915. Meanwhile, she watched as her Scottish Equerry, who wasn't that much younger than her, stepped forward to put down her wreath. On Sunday, it will be an Equerry who will do this for The Duke of Edinburgh. This will happen immediately after the Prince of Wales has placed the Queen's and before he returns to place his own iconic one, which is dominated with the three feathers badge of the Heir Apparent. Throughout Sunday's brief ceremony, the Queen will be where she wanted to be, beside her husband. We know why the Queen has made this decision this year. She is 91 and Prince Philip is well into his 97th year. This summer marked the end of his public life but Remembrance is one of those iconic annual ceremonies that both seem set on attending together. After all, the Queen and Prince Philip represent the wartime generation that fought and won freedom in the Second World War. They continue to represent the generation of our parents, or grandparents, that heard the sirens and bombers over our cities, served in the Armed Services and must have endured the loss of countless friends. After they will watch as their four children and two of their grandchildren add tributes to the gradual cascade of poppies around the Cenotaph's base. Then the Queen's 13th Prime Minister, Theresa May, will lay the Government's wreath, as Churchill did at the start of her reign and as Lloyd George did at the first of these ceremonies in 1920. The nations of the Commonwealth then help to complete the circle of poppy red and, in so doing their names remind us all what 'world war' really meant, as all these far flung countries were then part of Britain's old empire. Having stepped onto her balcony vantage point at seconds to 11am, just 25 minutes later the Queen will bow a second time to the Cenotaph before withdrawing to return home. Thousands of veterans, some from the Second World War and also in their 90s, will then march past this square of emblematic white stone and leave it further anointed with their memories, salute and tributes of poppy red. But chief among the broadening sea of wreaths will stand the Queen's, as if she had placed it there herself because, like her grandfather George V in 1920, she will have in every real sense."

Utilising Twitter's new 280-character tweet length Mr Trump gave his thoughts on a range of subjects, from relations with Russia, China's efforts to rein in North Korea, and a sarcastic message about his bid to make ""a friend"" of Kim. The spectre of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme has loomed large over the President's trip, with one of the aims of tour to persuade China to put more pressure on the North. A particularly stern speech from Mr Trump in South Korea prompted Kim's government to brand him an ""old lunatic"" - the latest broadside in a long-running war of words between the two leaders. Mr Trump took exception to being called ""old"", responding with a tweet laden with sarcasm: Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ""old,"" when I would NEVER call him ""short and fat?"" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen! The comments are likely to go down extremely badly in Pyongyang, with North Korea extremely sensitive to any remarks - even if not meant to be taken seriously - that it sees as disrespectful to its rulers. Mr Trump later toned down his rhetoric when asked about the tweet during a joint press conference with Vietnam's president, Tran Dai Quang. He said it would be a ""good thing"" for North Korea and the world if he and Kim could become friends, saying it ""might be a strange thing to happen but it's certainly a possibility"". In another message, Mr Trump said there had been progress on getting China to up the pressure on its neighbour: President Xi of China has stated that he is upping the sanctions against #NoKo. Said he wants them to denuclearize. Progress is being made. Also on the trip, Mr Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin several times on the margins of a summit in Vietnam. He said he asked the Russian leader if he interfered in the 2016 US election and received assurances from Mr Putin that he ""absolutely did not meddle"". The President said he had ""good discussions"" with his Russian counterpart on Syria, writing: Met with President Putin of Russia who was at #APEC meetings. Good discussions on Syria. Hope for his help to solve, along with China the dangerous North Korea crisis. Progress being made. When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help! Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One while making his way to Hanoi on Saturday, Mr Trump said he believed the Russian leader was being sincere when he denied meddling. ""I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,"" he said. Mr Trump called the claim an ""artificial barrier"" put up by Democrats and once again cast doubt on the conclusion from his own intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the presidential poll to ensure Hillary Clinton was defeated. ""Having a good relationship with Russia's a great, great thing. And this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way,"" Mr Trump said. ""People will die because of it."""

The distressed dog was found the following evening, wedged head-first into a 6in (15cm) gap between two walls, half a mile away from her Watford home. The home owner said she only became aware Taba was there when her cat began behaving strangely and she went outside to investigate. After the RSPCA struggled to free the trapped animal, Hertfordshire firefighters came to the rescue, pulling her to safety after a three-hour operation. After being sedated, the medium sized dog was winched to safety using ropes. RSPCA inspector Rachel Smith said Taba ""barely had room to breathe"" and ""was so scared and distressed, I was concerned that she was going to wedge herself in even tighter."" After managing to get a hook around her collar, Ms Smith held her in place and called the fire service for help. After spending the night at the vet's, Taba's microchip was used to locate her worried owners, who had been searching for her since her disappearance. With no major injuries from her ordeal, Taba has been suffering from sore paws since her lucky escape."

She has maintained her innocence and insisted the tablets were for her Egyptian partner who suffers from chronic back pain. Ms Plummer, from Hull, faces a long prison sentence if convicted and she has been held in a 15ft by 15ft cell with 25 other women for weeks. MP Karl Turner said her partner Omar Caboo has shown evidence which proves he has a bad back, and therefore confirms she was bringing the medication to Egypt for him from the UK. Tramadol is listed by Egyptian authorities as an illegal drug because of its wide use as a heroin substitute. The MP said: ""Tramadol is a controlled Class C drug in the UK, and is banned entirely in Egypt because it's a recreation drug of choice and changes hands for money and is very addictive and they are desperate to stamp it out."" Mr Turner said of Ms Plummer: ""She's a woman of good character in this country from a law-abiding family, and clearly the whole thing will be a dreadful experience. ""Even for the most ardent criminal, this would be a terribly frightening experience. She's sharing a cell with at least 25 other women, none of which speak English."""

The total is eight short of the number needed to trigger a leadership contest under Conservative Party rules. There was a mixed reaction to the news from prominent Tory MPs. ""I have not heard this"", one told Sky News, while another said the 40 figure ""doesn't sound right"". But others said it was ""around that number"" and it ""probably is (accurate)"". Meanwhile, the Mail on Sunday has obtained what it says is a leaked letter from Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, in which the two Vote Leave figureheads tell the PM how to deliver Brexit. A senior Government source told the newspaper the memo represented a ""soft coup"" and showed Mrs May was ""their Downing Street hostage"". Mr Johnson and Mr Gove have not spoken about the emergence of the document so far, while Number 10 said it did not comment on leaks. According to the Mail, Mr Johnson and Mr Gove demand in the note that the Brexit transition must end on 30 June 2021 and call on the PM to ensure the Cabinet falls behind the Brexit plan by ""clarifying their minds"" and making sure they ""internalise the logic"". The pair also appear to take a thinly veiled shot at the Remain-backing Chancellor Philip Hammond for lacking the ""sufficient energy"" in prepare for Britain's post-Brexit future. Titled EU Exit - Next Steps and marked ""For your and Gavin's eyes only"", the letter states: ""Your approach is governed by sensible pragmatism. That does not in any way dilute our ambition to be a fully independent self-governing country by the time of the next election. ""If we are to counter those who wish to frustrate that end, there are ways of underlining your resolve.

2017-11-12,"British Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage,  will be in line for a ""golden goodbye"" pay out of over â¬6m (Â£5.3m) when the UK leaves the EU, Sky News has learnt.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171112234150/https://news.sky.com/story/british-meps-in-line-for-83646m-golden-goodbye-when-uk-leaves-eu-11123258,"A senior European Union source has confirmed that these so-called ""transition payments"", in effect redundancy money for MEPs when they stand down or lose their seats, will be paid to Britain's 73 MEPs. However the same source has said that Brussels will not pay for it and that it will in effect be added to the so-called ""Brexit bill"" which Britain must pay. The scheme awards one month's salary for each year served as an MEP, up to a maximum of 24 months. Senior figures who campaigned for the Leave campaign will be in line to receive substantial sums. Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader who remains a group leader in the European Parliament, is set to receive around â¬169,000 (Â£150,000). Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP, will receive the same sum. Other figures, including prominent Remain supporters who have served even longer, will be in line to receive the maximum amount of over â¬200,000 (Â£176,000). This excludes other benefits, including free private healthcare for themselves and family members in perpetuity and generous pension allowances. There is no question of any impropriety - all members are legally entitled to the money - but some will doubtless find the prospect of MEPs who voted to leave financially benefiting from Brexit a rum one - especially given that their compensation will have to be paid directly by the British taxpayer, not by the EU. And indeed being paid out of a sum of money - the Brexit bill - which many of them say should not even exist. MEPs have already experienced a substantial increase in their salary as it is paid in euros. With sterling's depreciation since the referendum, MEPs' purchasing power has increased by over 10% since 2016. Mr Farage is unrepentant about accepting the money. When asked by Sky News if it was his intention to accept it, he replied: ""After 18 years hard service I'd probably take it,"" but added: ""But they won't give it to me."" Mr Farage said that he thought it highly likely that the EU would try to deny the payments and pensions owed to him and other prominent Ukippers on account of their euroscepticism: ""Given the nasty vindictive nature of these institutions I'd be very surprised if I get what's due."" Richard Corbett, a long-standing Labour MEP who will also receive the money, says that is nonsense: ""He's entitled to it. There's no question of the EU saying some can have it and some can't. It's a typical Farage invention, if I might say so."" The case of MEPs' redundancy payments and pension rights is in some ways a microcosm of the arguments around whether or not Britain does indeed sport liabilities to the EU. Mr Farage says that the pensions of the 22,000 British people who have at some point worked for the EU are the one area he sees there being a case for the UK paying some contribution. If no deal is reached between the UK and the EU it is possible that MEPs might still be able to get the money, but they might have to appeal to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to get it. The irony of Mr Farage applying to that body isn't lost on the man himself: ""I don't think I'd do very well there,"" he jokes. But some in Brussels are wondering whether or not the money will ever need to be paid at all. As Mr Farage told me: ""The argument some people are making around here lately is that if there is a transition period then there needs to be a British MEP voice during that period, that they could be non-voting honourary members of the EU Parliament with salaries but without voting rights and I've heard that from someone very close to Juncker himself."" There is a precedent for that: before the new countries of eastern Europe joined in 2004 they had observer MEPs to look after their interests on the way in. The argument goes you could have the same for Britain on its way out. This isn't a view confined to the Brexiteers, alive to conspiracies and concerns about Brexit backsliding. The arch-remainer Richard Corbett agreed with the idea and goes further, by pointing out that it will be the agreement reached between the EU and UK which sets the date of departure and that during the transition it would make more sense for Britain to remain a full member of the EU, perhaps two or three years after the official 2019 Article 50 countdown runs out. That way the UK would retain its ability to shape the regulations and laws to which it would remain subject during any transition. If that happened then Britain would take part in the next round of European elections scheduled for May 2019. And if we did Mr Farage is certain about where he'll be: ""I cannot think of anything I'd less like to do after 2019 for a couple of years. ""But if they really do fudge this and the British parliament betrays the will of the people and if effectively we don't Brexit before the next set of European elections and we have to contest those elections I will be there in the front line contesting those elections and I will give them, the establishment a result which they can't even bear to look at."""

""He looked at a woman standing next to me, ten years my senior, pointed to me and said: 'You should f*** her to make her realise she's gay,'"" Page wrote. ""He was the film's director, Brett Ratner."" ""He 'outed' me with no regard for my well-being, an act we all recognise as homophobic."" In a long Facebook post, Page claimed the director said degrading things to other actors, and condemned an ""epidemic"" of violence against women that shuns victims and celebrates the continuing careers of perpetrators. The actress, also known for her role in Inception, said that at the time of Ratner's alleged remark ""I was a young adult who had not yet come out to myself."" ""This public, aggressive outing left me with long standing feelings of shame,"" Page said. ""Making someone feel ashamed of who they are is a cruel manipulation, designed to oppress and repress."" Ratner, who also directed, produced or financed blockbuster films including The Revenant and Rush Hour, was accused of misconduct by six women, including actress Olivia Munn, in a Los Angeles Times article earlier this month. He has categorically denied the allegations detailed in the LA Times, and has not addressed Page's accusations. As well as claims against Ratner, Page's post details what the actress claims were incidents of harassment, including sexual assault, which took place when she was 16. She condemned what she called the disproportionate impact of sexual violence on vulnerable people ""silenced by their economic circumstances"", and praised gay and trans women of colour, like writer Audre Lorde and activist Marsha P Johnson, who have fought against oppression but remain relatively unknown. Other celebrities were quick to express support for the 30-year-old Page after the publication of the post, with X-Men co-star Anna Paquin corroborating her account. I was there when that comment was made. I stand with you .@EllenPage https://t.co/DEIvKDXeEL It comes weeks after allegations against film director Harvey Weinstein, as well as a #MeToo hashtag used by women to described experiences of sexual harassment, exposed a crisis of abuse spanning far beyond Hollywood. Comedian Louis CK has been hit by allegations of misconduct by five women. He has admitted to the allegations and apologised. In her post, Page called on ""Hollywood to wake up and start taking some responsibility for how we all have played a role in this"". ""This is a long awaited reckoning. It must be,"" she wrote. ""We've learned that the status quo perpetuates unfair, victimising behaviour to protect and perpetuate itself.""

Those aged 55 and over are more confused on the subject, with just 36% saying they are certain where the line is. The findings come in the wake of the Hollywood and Westminster scandals, which have prompted debate on what is and isn't appropriate behaviour. The Sky Data poll also reveals: For a clear definition on the issue, Sky News spoke to Professor Jennifer Brown, who has studied harassment for 25 years. She said: ""Definitions of sexual harassment are unwanted behaviour, unreciprocated behaviour (which) causes distress. ""If the recipient feels uncomfortable, or they don't like it, they signal that they don't like it and it persists. Then it can be harassment."" Professor Brown, from the London School of Economics and Political Science, added that sexual harassment is complicated. She said: ""It depends on the who, what, when and where - so who's doing it, to whom and what circumstances. ""What has changed is there are new channels for it, so when I first looked at it, 20-odd years ago, there was no mobile phones, so sexting, the sending of explicit texts, the sending of explicit emails, these sort of things didn't happen. ""So there's a degree of morphing, where the behaviour adapts to modern circumstances."" :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,002 Sky customers online between 7 and 9 November.

The formula is meant to make the allocation of school budgets fairer. But the Worth Less? campaign says it won't work. The group is led by headteacher Jules White, whose own school, Tanbridge House in West Sussex, is one of the country's lowest funded. Mr White admits his budget is so tight they've cut teachers and can't afford to properly use cleaners. ""Day to day it's desperate,"" he said. ""If I lose a teacher I can't afford to replace them. Our children most crucially are being disadvantaged as well. They're all going to sit the same GCSE yet they're in class sizes of 35, they don't get one-to-one support that they want. ""I'm really proud of the school, we're doing great, but think how well we could do if we were just funded adequately."" Even under the new formula Mr White reckons his school won't receive enough extra money. He claims the Government's own figures highlight the imbalance. Under the new formula, in 2018-19 an average funded primary school in Devon will receive Â£407,200 less than the same size school in the London borough of Greenwich. An average secondary school in Oxford will get Â£4,050,200 less than the same size school in Hackney. That's the equivalent of 133 teachers. We met year ten students during a maths lesson. They agreed the school's budget sums seem unfair. One pupil said: ""It's very unexpected, when you're at school you just think that you're the same as everyone else. We just feel a bit less worth. Like we're worth less than all those other schools."" Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: ""The introduction of the National Funding Formula from 2018-19, backed by Â£1.3bn of additional investment, has been widely welcomed and will put an end to historic disparities in the system. ""There are no cuts in funding, every school will see an increase in funding through the formula from 2018."" But many dispute the notion of additional investment. Mr White believes in real terms, schools' budgets are still being cut by Â£1.7bn. This is why on Tuesday representatives will deliver a letter to the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, ahead of this month's Budget. Parents have been throwing their support behind the move too. Dad David Gabriel said he's worried the next generation will suffer. ""As class sizes grow then my son's education and all the kids' here and in West Sussex are going to have a substandard education,"" he said. ""And he is actually, in the Government's eyes, worth less than children in other parts of the country."" Mr White says the support behind his campaign couldn't be stronger.

2017-11-12,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171112234150/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

Thousands of pounds worth of iPhones, iPads and watches were stolen after the gang broke into the building, and a security guard was threatened with a hammer when he attempted to confront the thieves. Mounted on five mopeds, the gang were inside the store for less than three minutes, with look-outs reportedly posted outside the store while others snatched items on display stands. Two iPhone Xs were later recovered near King's Cross. A red scooter was left abandoned inside the glass doors of the store and detectives are combing through CCTV recordings of the robbery. It is the latest raid and one of the most high-profile of an increasingly visible burglary tactic in recent weeks. Last month, thieves riding mopeds burgled the high-end Mappin & Webb jeweller's store in the same street. Official figures suggest that there are on average 53 moped-enabled crimes in London every day, including thefts and robberies."
2017-11-13,"One thing Marks and Spencer has been excellent at during recent years, whatever you think of it as a retailer, has been its ability to downplay City expectations ahead of publication of its results.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/how-will-ms-measure-up-as-changes-accelerate-11118775,"The latest were no exception. The market had been primed for half year pre-tax profits, on an underlying basis, of Â£200m. An outturn of Â£219.1m, then, came as a pleasant surprise to investors, even if it did represent a drop of 5.3% on the same period last year. There was another pleasant surprise in the clothing performance - long the Achilles heel for M&S. :: M&S signals more store closures in shake-up Total clothing and home sales during the most recent quarter were actually up 0.6% on the same period last year while, on a like-for-like basis (which measures sales in stores trading in the same format for the last year or more) they were down by a mere 0.1%. That was better than most M&S-watchers had been expecting. There are growing indications that the decline in clothing has been stemmed and Steve Rowe, the chief executive, could point to the fact that M&S has cut the number of sales in clothing and home from nine to four while also cutting back on promotions. That is showing up in further improvement in margins. That was the good - or, at least, the reasonably positive - news. More disappointing was the admission that like-for-like sales of food, undoubtedly the strongest card for M&S during the last decade, fell by 0.1% both during the latest quarter and during the first half of the year as a whole. Total food sales were up by 4.4%, reflecting new store openings, but Mr Rowe was warning ominously about the ""headwinds facing our food business"" having ""intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". Accordingly, while Mr Rowe insists ""investment returns remain high"", the company is reining back on expansion of its popular Simply Food chain. It is not difficult to detect the hand of Archie Norman, the new M&S chairman, in either this decision or in the departure of Helen Weir, the chief financial officer, whose exit was first reported last night by Sky's Mark Kleinman. Mr Norman, who succeeded the urbane former investment banker Robert Swannell in September, is a hard-driving turnaround expert still revered in the City for the way, a quarter of a century ago, he and Allan Leighton rescued Asda from collapse before selling it to Wal-Mart for Â£6.7bn in 1999. Most sector-watchers who know him reckon Mr Norman will be pushing the likeable Mr Rowe to accelerate the pace of change at M&S and in particular the speed at which the retailer brings down its costs. As M&S seeks to place greater emphasis on its digital sales, Mr Rowe had previously announced plans to close 30 of its larger stores, but insists now that was the ""minimum"" and that M&S would ""go faster"" in closing underperforming stores. The company confirmed that, by 2022, it will have 60 fewer stores than it did in 2016 - yet many will question whether it could not be reducing its space by more. By then, meanwhile, M&S aims to be making a third of its sales online. Other questions remain. One is over Mr Rowe's recent appointment of Jill McDonald as head of clothing and home. Ms McDonald is well-regarded, due to successful stints as managing director of McDonald's UK and as chief executive of Halfords, but some investors worry about her lack of specific experience in fashion, particularly as her appointment triggered the departure of the former head of clothing, Jo Jenkins. The concern is understandable. Fashion, particularly women's fashion, is the fulcrum of M&S. Get that right and absolutely everything else follows. Ever since the late Sir Richard Greenbury retired nearly 19 years ago, M&S has had a string of leaders - Peter Salsbury, Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes, Sir Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland - who have all grappled with trying to either stem decline or revive the group's fortunes. That said, in Mr Norman and Mr Rowe, M&S probably has as good a combination of chairman and chief executive as it could hope for in seeking to achieve the latter. In Mr Norman, it has someone who will agitate for rapid and even radical change, but who also boasts experience of transforming a low-growth retailer into a high-growth one. In Mr Rowe, meanwhile, it has someone who has spent almost his entire career at M&S, who is steeped in its values, who loves the business, who understands its staff and customers and who can use that as potent weapons in driving change. As demonstrated by the warm response to its Christmas advertisements featuring Paddington Bear, there is still massive public goodwill towards M&S, probably greater than any other retailer enjoys with the possible exception of John Lewis. That is a fabulous platform on which to build."
2017-11-13,A dog has had a lucky escape after jumping from a first-floor window and running half a mile before becoming wedged in a tiny space between two walls.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/dog-wedged-between-two-walls-freed-by-firemen-after-firework-scare-11123580,"Taba disappeared from her home on 3 November after being scared by fireworks, squeezing out of an upstairs window and using a conservatory roof as a means to escape. The distressed dog was found the following evening, wedged head-first into a 6in (15cm) gap between two walls, half a mile away from her Watford home. The home owner said she only became aware Taba was there when her cat began behaving strangely and she went outside to investigate. After the RSPCA struggled to free the trapped animal, Hertfordshire firefighters came to the rescue, pulling her to safety after a three-hour operation. After being sedated, the medium sized dog was winched to safety using ropes. RSPCA inspector Rachel Smith said Taba ""barely had room to breathe"" and ""was so scared and distressed, I was concerned that she was going to wedge herself in even tighter."" After managing to get a hook around her collar, Ms Smith held her in place and called the fire service for help. After spending the night at the vet's, Taba's microchip was used to locate her worried owners, who had been searching for her since her disappearance. With no major injuries from her ordeal, Taba has been suffering from sore paws since her lucky escape."

During a House of Commons grilling, Mr Johnson told MPs: ""The British Government has no doubt Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran on holiday and that was the sole purpose of her visit. ""My remarks on the subject before the Foreign Affairs Committee could and should have been clearer and I acknowledge that the words I used were open to being misinterpreted, and I apologise. ""I apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family if I have inadvertently caused them any further anguish."" Mr Johnson's comments about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have sparked fears the 38-year-old could face a longer jail sentence. Both the Iranian judiciary and media have used the Foreign Secretary's words as justification for her imprisonment, leading to calls for Mr Johnson to resign. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who forced Mr Johnson to face MPs on Monday with her urgent question, took issue with the Foreign Secretary's suggestion his comments were ""misinterpreted"" as she demanded he ""unequivocally"" state he ""simply got it wrong"". She told the Foreign Secretary his ""pride matters not one ounce compared to Nazanin's freedom"". Responding, Mr Johnson said: ""Of course I apologise for the distress and suffering that has been caused by the impression that I gave that the Government believe, and I believe, that she was there in a professional capacity. ""She was there on holiday. I do apologise, and of course I retract any suggestion that she was there in a professional capacity."" Under further pressure from Labour MPs to confess to an error, Mr Johnson acknowledged his ""mistake"" and admitted: ""It was wrong of me to say she was there in a professional capacity."" Following Mr Johnson's appearance in the House of Commons, Mrs Zagahri-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told Sky News he would not be joining demands for the Foreign Secretary to resign. ""It's important that the Foreign Secretary stays to see it through and brings Nazanin home,"" he said. Mr Ratcliffe stressed he did not want to be seen as ""some sort of political agitator"" in Iran, which could allow the regime to ""build a conspiracy"". But Mr Ratcliffe did reveal his anger with the Government's handling of his wife's case, adding: ""Don't get me wrong, I've not always been happy with the Government, the Government knows that behind closed doors, the Government knows that on the media and so on. ""I'm pretty transparent about that. But at the same time I'm not trying to push for anyone to lose their job, I'm just trying to bring Nazanin home."" Monique Villa, the chief executive of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's employers, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, also backed away from calling for Mr Johnson to go. Ahead of Mr Johnson's planned visit to Tehran in the next few weeks, she told Sky News: ""Boris Johnson now has a mission and I want him to execute on his mission. ""He's certainly the right person now to go and compensate for the enormous harm he has done."" Ms Villa revealed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works as a project manager for the charitable arm of the Thomson Reuters news agency, is ""now very seriously worried"" about lumps she has found on her breasts. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran's capital since April last year, when she was arrested at Tehran airport as she attempted to return home together with her young daughter, Gabriella. She is accused of plotting to overthrow the country's regime. Downing Street has said offering Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection is ""one of the options"" being considered. The Government's response to her plight came in for renewed scrutiny on Sunday after Environment Secretary Michael Gove said he did not know why Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran when she was arrested."

2017-11-13,"British Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage,  will be in line for a ""golden goodbye"" pay out of over â¬6m (Â£5.3m) when the UK leaves the EU, Sky News has learnt.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/british-meps-in-line-for-83646m-golden-goodbye-when-uk-leaves-eu-11123258,"A senior European Union source has confirmed that these so-called ""transition payments"", in effect redundancy money for MEPs when they stand down or lose their seats, will be paid to Britain's 73 MEPs. However the same source has said that Brussels will not pay for it and that it will in effect be added to the so-called ""Brexit bill"" which Britain must pay. The scheme awards one month's salary for each year served as an MEP, up to a maximum of 24 months. Senior figures who campaigned for the Leave campaign will be in line to receive substantial sums. Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader who remains a group leader in the European Parliament, is set to receive around â¬169,000 (Â£150,000). Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP, will receive the same sum. Other figures, including prominent Remain supporters who have served even longer, will be in line to receive the maximum amount of over â¬200,000 (Â£176,000). This excludes other benefits, including free private healthcare for themselves and family members in perpetuity and generous pension allowances. There is no question of any impropriety - all members are legally entitled to the money - but some will doubtless find the prospect of MEPs who voted to leave financially benefiting from Brexit a rum one - especially given that their compensation will have to be paid directly by the British taxpayer, not by the EU. And indeed being paid out of a sum of money - the Brexit bill - which many of them say should not even exist. MEPs have already experienced a substantial increase in their salary as it is paid in euros. With sterling's depreciation since the referendum, MEPs' purchasing power has increased by over 10% since 2016. Mr Farage is unrepentant about accepting the money. When asked by Sky News if it was his intention to accept it, he replied: ""After 18 years hard service I'd probably take it,"" but added: ""But they won't give it to me."" Mr Farage said that he thought it highly likely that the EU would try to deny the payments and pensions owed to him and other prominent Ukippers on account of their euroscepticism: ""Given the nasty vindictive nature of these institutions I'd be very surprised if I get what's due."" Richard Corbett, a long-standing Labour MEP who will also receive the money, says that is nonsense: ""He's entitled to it. There's no question of the EU saying some can have it and some can't. It's a typical Farage invention, if I might say so."" The case of MEPs' redundancy payments and pension rights is in some ways a microcosm of the arguments around whether or not Britain does indeed sport liabilities to the EU. Mr Farage says that the pensions of the 22,000 British people who have at some point worked for the EU are the one area he sees there being a case for the UK paying some contribution. If no deal is reached between the UK and the EU it is possible that MEPs might still be able to get the money, but they might have to appeal to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to get it. The irony of Mr Farage applying to that body isn't lost on the man himself: ""I don't think I'd do very well there,"" he jokes. But some in Brussels are wondering whether or not the money will ever need to be paid at all. As Mr Farage told me: ""The argument some people are making around here lately is that if there is a transition period then there needs to be a British MEP voice during that period, that they could be non-voting honourary members of the EU Parliament with salaries but without voting rights and I've heard that from someone very close to Juncker himself."" There is a precedent for that: before the new countries of eastern Europe joined in 2004 they had observer MEPs to look after their interests on the way in. The argument goes you could have the same for Britain on its way out. This isn't a view confined to the Brexiteers, alive to conspiracies and concerns about Brexit backsliding. The arch-remainer Richard Corbett agreed with the idea and goes further, by pointing out that it will be the agreement reached between the EU and UK which sets the date of departure and that during the transition it would make more sense for Britain to remain a full member of the EU, perhaps two or three years after the official 2019 Article 50 countdown runs out. That way the UK would retain its ability to shape the regulations and laws to which it would remain subject during any transition. If that happened then Britain would take part in the next round of European elections scheduled for May 2019. And if we did Mr Farage is certain about where he'll be: ""I cannot think of anything I'd less like to do after 2019 for a couple of years. ""But if they really do fudge this and the British parliament betrays the will of the people and if effectively we don't Brexit before the next set of European elections and we have to contest those elections I will be there in the front line contesting those elections and I will give them, the establishment a result which they can't even bear to look at."""

Coroner Andre Rebello at the Gerard Majella Courthouse in Liverpool recorded a narrative conclusion and said it was ""more likely than not"" that the 22-year-old was killed by IS. The inquest, attended by Mr Rutter's family, also heard the cause of death was recorded as blast injuries in a post-mortem examination. The verdict comes after the YPG fighter apologised for lying to his family about going to fight Islamic State in a video message released after his death. He said: ""I lied to people I care about to come here. I said that I was going somewhere else, I didn't. ""I apologise massively for that. ""Apart from that I don't regret my decision and I hope that you respect it."" Mr Rebello said Mr Rutter's injuries came from either an improvised explosive device or a rocket exploding nearby. He said the man was hit with projectiles and shrapnel with ""immediate fatal consequences"". The coroner said: ""He travelled to Syria unbeknown to UK authorities and volunteered to fight with the YPG, a Kurdish people's protection unit, against Daesh, a recognised terrorist group. ""It is more likely that not he was killed by Daesh terrorists in this conflict."" Mr Rebello expressed his condolences to the family and added: ""For a child to die in these circumstances must be particularly hard."" Mr Rutter, who also went by the name Soro Zinar, is thought to have joined the YPG in Syria in March. A statement posted on its Facebook page following the death said: ""He was martyred on 5 July 2017 after battling bravely in the terrorist group's so-called capital. The people of Rojava will not forget his sacrifice.""

Following a one million euro (Â£880,000) donation from a German foundation, that is the amount left that is needed, the charity says. Kate Mavor, English Heritage's chief executive, said: ""The Iron Bridge is one of the most important - if not the most important - bridges ever built. ""It sits in the cradle of the Industrial Revolution and is open to everyone to visit, for free, every day of the year. But after two centuries, its cast iron is cracking and if it is to survive, the bridge needs our support."" Scaffolding is in place around the bridge, which was erected over the River Severn in 1779 has been a UNESCO world heritage site since 1986. The charity wants to raise the funds by next month."
2017-11-13,Labour's shadow Brexit secretary has written to the Prime Minister urging her to back his party's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) bill.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-urges-pm-to-back-its-brexit-transition-plan-amid-tory-disarray-11124736,"Sir Keir Starmer says unless the Government backs the Labour amendment to allow the single market to continue operating for another two years after Brexit, Theresa May's pledge to implement a transitional arrangement will be impossible. Sir Keir told Sky News ""everybody"" agrees a transitional deal will be necessary because a trade deal with the EU will not be in place by Brexit in 2019. But he said Mrs May's offer to the EU of a two-year transitional period, made during her speech in Florence in September, would not be possible because it ""extinguishes"" Britain's subjection to the European Court of Justice - the court that underpins the framework of the single market. It comes after repeated calls from senior hardline Brexiteer Conservatives for the Government to walk away from an EU deal, or at least prepare for no deal. It was revealed on Sunday that Boris Johnson and Michael Gove became the latest to do so, joining forces to write to Mrs May, calling on her to ensure all members of her senior team were behind Brexit and warning of the consequences of failing to plan. Sir Keir called on Mrs May to act in the ""national interest"", by supporting Labour's proposals for transitional arrangements, or at least to table an amendment that proposes the same arrangements. He said: ""Step back, think about this amendment, table the self-same amendment if you want, for heaven's sake, act now in the national interest, not in party interest."" It comes as Mrs May met European business leaders to discuss the future of UK-EU trade after Brexit. The Prime Minister will attempt to win support from European firms for her goal of moving the negotiations on to trade talks. A former Conservative Government member, pro-remain Dominic Grieve, criticised the Government's own Brexit bill amendment, tabled last week, which would set the date for leaving the EU as 29 March 2019. The amendments will be debated as the landmark EU (Withdrawal) Bill goes into its committee stage this week. ""The amendment that has been tabled by the Government, there is a day on which we have got to go... seems to reduce the Government's flexibility in its negotiations - it's an incoherent and thoroughly stupid amendment. It won't have my support,"" he said. He added: ""I'm not in the business of trying to obstruct Brexit taking place, even though I think it's a disaster, because in the light of the referendum result I don't think it would be right for me to do so. ""(But) If the public in this country, come to the conclusion that they want something different, then I think Parliament ought to be in a position to respond."" Speaking ahead of the Prime Minister's business meeting, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said most businesses were nervous about the Government's pursuit of a hard Brexit and needed certainty. ""Any transitional deal needs to maintain the status quo so as to provide the certainty that business needs. The Prime Minister must push for a deal that keeps us within the customs union and single market,"" he said. But Tory former leader and cabinet secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Labour was shifting its position onBrexit. He told the BBC: ""Staying inside the Court of Justice would actually be tantamount to staying within the European Union."" Mrs May wants to agree the broad outline of a transition deal with the European Union for after Brexit in the next few months, her spokesman said on Monday. ""We would hope we could reach an agreement on the broad outline of what an implementation period looks like within the next few months,"" the spokesman told reporters."

He had a suitcase with him which contained more than 40 precious gems. The 35-year-old had put the case on the luggage rack and realised it was missing when the train arrived at Rugby. Detectives believe the bag is most likely to have been stolen from the train before it left Euston. Police want to speak to a man who was seen on CCTV in connection with the theft of the large black suitcase. ""I'd also like to hear from anyone who was on board the train or at Euston station on Wednesday evening, who may have seen a man acting suspiciously,"" investigating officer Detective Sergeant Nick Thompson said. :: Anyone who has information or recognises the man shown in the CCTV image is urged to contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016, quoting reference number 529 8/11/17."
2017-11-13,The Queen watched on for the first time in her 65-year reign as Prince Charles led Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph in Whitehall.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/remembrance-sunday-uk-falls-silent-to-honour-war-dead-11123476,"In a break with tradition, Prince Charles laid the head of state's wreath at the base of the monument shortly after a two-minute silence at 11am. The Queen appeared to wipe away a tear as she watched the service from a Foreign Office balcony with the Duke of Edinburgh and Duchess of Cornwall. The change of protocol is seen as one of the Queen's most significant handovers of Royal responsibilities to the heir to the throne. Placing the wreath at the base of the Whitehall monument would have required the monarch, who is 91, to walk backwards down the stone steps. As well as laying the head of state's wreath, Charles laid his own wreath at the base of the Cenotaph. The Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry, the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Kent also laid wreaths. Charles has stepped in for the Queen at the ceremony twice before - in 1983 when she was in Kenya and in 1999 when the monarch travelled to South Africa. Across the rest of the country, millions honoured Britain's war dead at other Remembrance Day commemorations. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire and DUP leader Arlene Foster laid wreaths at the cenotaph in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh - 30 years since an IRA bombing there killed 12 on Remembrance Sunday. Meanwhile, a suspicious object found close to a war memorial in Omagh, County Tyrone, was a viable pipe bomb device, say police. It has been taken away by officers for further examination. PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: ""This small but potentially dangerous device was left to cause the maximum amount of disruption to the Remembrance Sunday commemorations. ""This is the action of a small and callous group of violent people who have nothing to offer our communities other than fear and intimidation."" The alert forced the diversion of a parade and the cancellation of wreath-laying. In August 1998, a Real IRA bombing in Omagh claimed 29 lives and was the biggest single atrocity during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. On Saturday, the Queen and senior royals joined servicemen and women past and present at the annual Festival of Remembrance as the nation remembered its war dead on Armistice Day. The monarch was joined at the Royal Albert Hall in London by thousands of veterans for the 90th anniversary of the event, organised by the Royal British Legion, of which she is patron."

""This includes tackling the problems in the region today - such as North Korea, where we have played a leading role in securing sanctions in response to the regime's outrageous proliferation of nuclear weapons,"" she said. :: Explained: The Rohingya refugee crisis And paying tribute to Sky's coverage, Mrs May said: ""And it includes continuing to step up our efforts to respond to the desperate plight of Rohingyas - brought home to us again on our TV screens so graphically today, with heartbreaking images of young children emaciated and pleading for help. ""This is a major humanitarian crisis which looks like ethnic cleansing. ""And it is something for which the Burmese authorities - and especially the military - must take full responsibility."" The Prime Minister added: ""The UK is already the largest donor in response to this crisis. ""And we will continue to play a leading role in bringing the international community together - working through the UN and with regional partners to do everything possible to stop this appalling and inhuman destruction of the Rohingya people."" :: Exclusive: The depth of Rohingya crisis revealed Mrs May also used her speech to launch a powerful attack on President Vladimir Putin's foreign policies and pledge the UK will continue to play a leading diplomatic role after Brexit. The Prime Minister suggested a post-Brexit trade deal would support Europe's commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of Russian threats to the international order. ""As I said in my speech in Florence, the UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe's security,"" she said. ""And the comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them. ""Chief among those today, of course, is Russia. Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea was the first time since the Second World War that one sovereign nation has forcibly taken territory from another in Europe. ""Since then, Russia has fomented conflict in the Donbass, repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries, and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption. :: Analysis: UK 'shirking responsibility' on Rohingya crisis Mrs May accused Russia of ""seeking to weaponise information"" as she criticised Moscow's meddling in elections and hacking of Denmark's defence ministry and the German parliament. ""Deploying its state-run media organisations to plant fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to sow discord in the West and undermine our institutions,"" she said. ""So I have a very simple message for Russia. We know what you are doing. And you will not succeed. ""Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies, and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us. ""The UK will do what is necessary to protect ourselves, and work with our allies to do likewise."" The Prime Minister announced that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson will visit Moscow in the coming months for talks, as she promised Britain will ""take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity"". But she added current tensions are ""not the relationship with Russia we want"". :: Why is Rohingya crisis not classed as genocide? ""We do not want to return to the Cold War, or to be in a state of perpetual confrontation,"" the Prime Minister said, adding: ""For there is another way. Many of us here looked at a post-Soviet Russia with hope. ""Because we know that a strong and prosperous Russia which plays by the rules would be in the interests of the United Kingdom, Europe and the world. ""As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international stability. ""Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path. ""But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend."" :: Mark Field: Rohingya face 'humanitarian crisis' On the Middle East, the Prime Minister announced she would visit Jordan later this month to discuss its moves to deal with the challenge of refugees from Syria. And claiming that Britain is at forefront of international efforts in the fight against Islamic State and Islamist terrorism, Mrs May warned the Government would order military intervention where necessary. ""Of course we must never be paralysed by the myth that armed intervention is doomed to fail,"" she said. ""And the UK is not and will not be afraid to deploy its hard power where necessary."" And on Africa, the Prime Minister revealed she has asked the new International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who succeeded Priti Patel last week, to link aid and trade. ""It is our partnership with the countries of Asia and Africa in particular that will define the course the world takes,"" Mrs May said."
2017-11-13,The pound has fallen amid market jitters over increasing pressure facing Theresa May's leadership.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/pound-slips-lower-as-may-faces-leadership-pressure-11124672,"Sterling dropped by more than a cent against the US dollar to less than $1.31 and was also down by a cent against the euro. It comes amid reports that 40 Conservative MPs are prepared to sign a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister. Mrs May also faced weekend claims that she was being held ""hostage"" by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove about how to deliver Brexit. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: ""The potential for yet another political upheaval in the UK has no doubt grabbed market attention."" Kit Juckes, global fixed income strategist at Societe Generale, said: ""Sterling is priced for soggy (economic) growth and difficult (political) negotiations."" The pound's latest wobble comes as the time frame for trying to reach the next stage of Brexit negotiations comes into sharp focus. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Friday that the UK must clarify or concede more in the next two weeks if it wants to move on to trade talks in December. Meanwhile, the CBI and its counterparts from Europe's largest economies are meeting the Prime Minister on Monday to urge her to fight for an immediate transition deal. The value of the pound collapsed after the vote to leave the European Union in June last year and was as low as $1.20 against the dollar earlier in 2017. Since then it has partially recovered but the pound is still around 13% lower than just before the referendum result emerged. A weak pound makes imports more expensive, driving up prices for consumers as well as squeezing retailers as they try to absorb some of the higher costs. But it has a positive impact for some manufacturers as cheaper sterling means UK-made goods are more competitively priced. Sterling's fall has also been positive for the FTSE 100, since many of the index's constituent companies earn much of their revenue in foreign currencies. The top-flight index was ahead on Monday after the pound's latest slip."
2017-11-13,"The pace of shop closures has fallen to its slowest pace for seven years, according to new figures - though separate data presented a gloomier picture for retailers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/stores-closing-at-slowest-pace-for-seven-years-11124552,"Figures compiled by the Local Data Company for PwC showed 2,564 units closed in high streets, retail parks and shopping centres in the first six months of the year. That is equivalent to 14 per day, the lowest level since 2010 - though the closures still outstripped the number of openings, at 2,342. The research showed that charity shops, gift shops and women's clothing shops were among the worst hit, while tobacconists, beauticians and coffee shops saw growth. Mike Jervis, insolvency partner and retail specialist at PwC, said: ""The relatively low level of net closures in the first half of the year reflects a more stable environment, with consumer confidence proving more resilient as the year unfolded."" The research also suggested that high street stores have been forced to evolve into ""leaner, fitter"" operations as they face up to the increasing incursion of online retail. But a separate report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed a less healthy picture for shops, as they reported a 2% decline in footfall in October compared to the same month last year. That was the worst decline since the time of the EU referendum in June last year. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said it mirrored the month's ""paltry sales performance"". She added that nearly one in 10 retail premises still lies empty, blamed on the burden of business rates which the BRC argues stifles investment in new stores or refurbishments. Meanwhile, figures from Visa showed a 2% fall in consumer spending in October, the biggest decline in more than four years. The data, based on Visa's debit and credit card data, represented the fifth fall in the last six months, and comes as households face a squeeze from rising inflation and weak wage growth. Visa's chief commercial officer Mark Antipof said: ""The figures are a stark indicator of the strain on household budgets even before the Bank of England's recent interest rate rise."" The study said November's Black Friday sales event would provide a clearer sign of how the Christmas season was shaping up. Meanwhile, another survey published on Monday, from the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, suggested there was little sign of a significant upturn in pay growth. It found that despite strong demand for staff and already low unemployment, planned pay rises were up only a little, to 2% - well below inflation at 3%."

It shows a truly alarming humanitarian crisis of huge proportions is taking place right here, right now, as you are reading this. And there is little intervention by the international community to halt it. It also puts paid to the claim by the Myanmar authorities that its army is simply enforcing security to curb terrorist activity. We travelled by fishing boat in the middle of the night via a circuitous route from south Bangladesh to Myanmar. We are keeping the journey details secret to avoid the route being closed down by either the Bangladeshi or Myanmar authorities. :: The Rohingya Crisis - All you need to know When we landed at Dang Khali Saur in Maungdaw district, there were crowds of people already in the shallows crying out for help. An elderly, severely malnourished woman was amongst the first we saw. Her arms and legs were so shrunken with lack of food, she could barely stand. As she fell forward, I reached out to help steady her and found I could put my fingers around her upper arm, she was so thin. We saw rows of babies who had been born on the beach. One was delivered the day before we arrived, and still had her umbilical cord attached. Another had a swollen distended stomach through lack of food. The crowds told us over and over again how the Myanmar military had driven them here, burning their homes and forcing them to flee. ""They are slaughtering us, destroying our houses and raping our women,"" one young man told us. They spoke about being trapped on the beach, some for as long as two months. :: Why is the Rohingya crisis not classed as genocide? The military, they say, has laid mines beyond the beach preventing any of them going back into Myanmar. So here they are: stranded on sand waiting for help, which never seems to arrive. Occasionally, desperate relatives in Bangladesh arrange for boats to sail over and pick groups up. :: Geldof handing back Freedom of Dublin in Myanmar protest But the journey is long and dangerous in the middle of the night. Most fishermen won't risk losing their livelihoods and possibly going to jail or being arrested by the much-feared Myanmar military. So they're just not waiting. We saw scores of young men busily trying to build their own raft out of bits of bamboo, string and discarded jerry cans. The structure was about 40 square feet. They had taken five days to build it and expected to finish it in another five days. The structure will be packed with families - some with very young children and babies, all balancing on top of this flimsy, homemade raft, and they will try to reach Bangladesh by paddling their way there. It is sheer desperation. It is difficult to imagine what further evidence the outside world needs to be convinced of the barbarity of what is going on in Myanmar. Hundreds of thousands of people have streamed overland to Bangladesh. The director general of the UN's international organisation for migration has told Sky News the number is expected to exceed a million in the coming weeks. They are now living in squalor there, with soaring malnutrition and disease rates. The miserable, trapped Rohingya families we saw in Rakhine State are those unable to make the trek by land because they are in the worst affected area. It is furthest away from the land border and there are dozens of Myanmar military checkpoints blocking their path. One of the fishing crew has to shout and beat back those we're leaving behind on the beach to stop them stampeding the boat and making it capsize. It is a heartbreaking scene. ""Take us, take us,"" some beg. Their hands are outstretched, imploring. I notice one man holding up his toddler. Another thrusts his baby at me and forces his son's tiny, shrunken leg into my hand to ensure I feel how skinny and frail he is. The boat's captain ushers us to the boat. He's anxious to leave before the Myanmar military, who are camped close by, are alerted to our presence. Our group chaotically clambers onto the boat. It has been anchored some distance from the shore to try to prevent a sudden rush of desperate people. Consequently, the passengers are waist-high in seawater trying to climb aboard and waves smash against them and threaten to knock them over. The captain had told us he had space for about 15 people. In the end, about 30 adults, children and babies are on board, squashed together taking up every available space. The gaunt, elderly woman we first met on arrival has been laid on the small shelf of wood against the bow. She is curled up, lying on her back. The crew hands out biscuits and water, and everyone hungrily devours them. This is the first nourishment many have had in days. The old woman beckons to me to give her some water and pulls herself up to take some. She tries to take just one gulp and finds she can't swallow. This is what happens with severe deprivation. A couple of hours later and we can see the lights of Bangladesh. The captain anchors some way off shore and urges his passengers to leave the boat quickly. He does not want to be arrested by the Bangladeshi Border Guards, who have been destroying fishing boats when they catch them with refugees on board. Within a few minutes, everyone has scrambled off the boat and headed for the trees fringing the beach. The elderly woman collapses in the water but is scooped up and helped by one of the young men and escorted to the shoreline. They pause in a rice field for a brief rest. ""We feel like we have been born again,"" one family tells us. But their faces and demeanour are still very subdued, almost dazed with trauma. They gather up their bundles of belongings that they've managed to carry with them and head off into the darkness and the unknown. They have their lives but precious little else."

She is reportedly the sixth woman to allege that Mr Bush, who is now 93, groped her. Ms Corrigan said the alleged incident involving the ex-president, who was then aged 79, happened at an event attended by CIA officers near Houston. She was there with her mother and her father - an intelligence analyst. She told Time magazine of the alleged incident: ""My initial action was absolute horror. I was really, really confused. ""The first thing I did was look at my mom and, while he was still standing there, I didn't say anything. ""What does a teenager say to the ex-president of the United States? Like, 'Hey dude, you shouldn't have touched me like that?'"" Her family has released a photo showing him standing alongside her at the November 2003 event. Ms Corrigan said: ""As soon as the picture was being snapped on the one-two-three he dropped his hands from my waist down to my buttocks and gave it a nice, ripe squeeze, which would account for the fact that in the photograph my mouth is hanging wide open. ""I was like, 'Oh my goodness, what just happened?'"" Mr Bush was the 41st president and served from 1989 to 1993. His spokesman, Jim McGrath, said in a statement that he regrets any offensive actions. He said: ""George Bush simply does not have it in his heart to knowingly cause anyone distress, and he again apologises to anyone he offended during a photo op."" The stories came to light last month after Boardwalk Empire actress Heather Lind said Mr Bush touched her from behind in a wheelchair and told a rude joke while they were posing for a photo in 2014. Mr McGrath said Mr Bush has been in a wheelchair for about five years ""so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures"". Mr Bush has vascular parkinsonism, a rare condition similar to Parkinson's disease, and he uses a wheelchair for mobility. ""To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke and on occasion, he has patted women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner,"" Mr McGrath explained. Ms Lind spoke out after a string of Hollywood stars came forward to accuse producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, harassment and rape. She said she had been inspired by ""the bravery of other women who have spoken up and written about their experiences""."

But she did and found her husband on the floor. He is believed to have taken his own life on 7 November at his home in Connah's Quay, Deeside, in North Wales. Along with family members, the emergency services tried to resuscitate Mr Sargeant for about 20 to 30 minutes, before pronouncing him dead. The former minister for children and communities was found dead after being sacked from his role and suspended by the Labour party. There has been mounting pressure on Wales' first minister, Carwyn Jones, to resign over his handling of the situation. Mr Sargeant's family claim he was unaware of the detail of the allegations he faced and was therefore unable to defend himself. They also insist the Welsh Labour Party was made aware of the impact the situation was having on his mental and physical health the day before he died. Mr Gittins said his job was not to apportion blame, but instead to establish the cause of Mr Sargeant's death. He said: ""Let me make it absolutely clear that my inquest will not consider the veracity of the allegations made against Mr Sargeant, nor will I be looking to Cardiff and the Welsh Assembly or the Welsh Labour Party and making adjudication as to who is right and who is wrong and who can be trusted. ""But, as part of my investigation, I must gather evidence to assist me in reaching a conclusion, as when the final inquest hearing takes place I will be required to give consideration to reaching a conclusion of suicide, which would require me to be certain that it was Mr Sargeant's intention to end his life."" The full inquest has been adjourned to a later date, which will be confirmed in due course. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK."

Writing in the online international journal BioScience, the scientists said every one of the major threats identified 25 years ago has worsened apart from the hole in the ozone layer, which has been stabilised. They said environmental impacts were likely to inflict ""substantial and irreversible harm"" on the Earth. :: Sky Ocean Rescue: How to get involved Their warning comes as the UN Climate Change Conference takes place in Bonn, Germany - the first major environmental meeting since US President Donald Trump said in June the US will pull out of the Paris accord, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5C. Led by top US ecologist Professor William Ripple, from Oregon State University, the open letter said: ""Humanity is now being given a second notice. ""We are jeopardising our future by not reining in our intense but geographically and demographically uneven material consumption and by not perceiving continued rapid population growth as a primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats. ""By failing to adequately limit population growth, reassess the role of an economy rooted in growth, reduce greenhouse gases, incentivise renewable energy, protect habitat, restore ecosystems, curb pollution, halt defaunation, and constrain invasive alien species, humanity is not taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperilled biosphere."" In their original 1992 warning scientists, including most of the world's Nobel Laureates, warned human impacts on the natural world were likely to lead to ""vast human misery"". The new notice was signed by 15,364 scientists from 184 countries and drew on data from government agencies, non-profit organisations and individual researchers. Prof Ripple said: ""Those who signed this second warning aren't just raising a false alarm. They are acknowledging the obvious signs that we are heading down an unsustainable path. ""We are hoping that our paper will ignite a widespread public debate about the global environment and climate.""

They said progress made in some areas, including reducing ozone-depleting chemicals and increasing renewable energy generation, had been far outweighed by the damage."
2017-11-13,A former boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann has been found guilty of an acid attack in a London nightclub.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/arthur-collins-guilty-of-nightclub-acid-attack-11125086,"Arthur Collins was convicted of five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and nine counts of actual bodily harm against 14 people. The 25-year-old, from Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, hurled the substance over a crowd at the Mangle E8 in Dalston, east London, on 17 April. Collins, who is the father of The Only Way Is Essex (Towie) star's newborn daughter, admitted throwing the bottle of fluid over clubbers but claimed he did not know it was acid. He said he thought the liquid was a date rape drug, which he had snatched from two men after overhearing them planning to spike a girl's drink. More than a dozen people were injured when acid was thrown over clubbers on the dancefloor of the packed venue. Victims described a burning smell and their skin ""blistering straight away"" before everyone started ""screaming, shouting, running"". Clubbers shielded their faces with clothing, and rubbed ice on blistered skin. The substance was later found to have a rating of pH1 - indicating a strong acid. Collins' co-defendant, Andre Phoenix, 21, from Tottenham, north London, was acquitted of four counts of grievous bodily harm and two of actual bodily harm on Monday morning. Collins was convicted on all counts on a majority verdict of 10 to two, and he will be sentenced on 19 December. There were tears in the public gallery, which was packed with Collins' friends and family, as the jury's verdicts were read out. Collins had told Wood Green Crown Court he had been in a serious relationship with Ms McCann for around a year at the time of the incident, and had found out she was pregnant just weeks earlier. ""It was the happiest I have ever felt. We were both really happy,"" he said. Collins went on the run after the attack and was arrested a few days later. He was Tasered as he was seized by armed police after trying to flee from an upstairs window of a house in Highham Ferrers, Northamptonshire. He said he did not hand himself in to police because he feared Ms McCann would be targeted by gang members if he did."

They look for widows because they are alone or orphans who have nobody to protect them. :: Rohingya crisis: Myanmar army chief fired ""Kasim"" is one of these sex traffickers preying on these women. He has agreed to be interviewed but only if we guarantee to hide his identity. We pick him up at a pre-arranged meeting point on a dark street outside Kutupalong refugee camp in southern Bangladesh's Ukhia district. He looks like he is in his late twenties, is clean shaven and dressed in jeans and a half sleeve shirt. :: Babies dumped and left to die in Rohingya crisis He is a Rohingya refugee himself and lives inside the camp, but his appearance suggests he was born in Bangladesh and his parents were one of the first wave of refugees who fled Myanmar in the past few decades. He said this latest exodus has been good for his evil trade. :: Why is the Rohingya crisis not classed as genocide? ""There are more and more people coming and they have lost everything. They don't have money, so more and more girls are coming into the business,"" he said. ""Now the old refugees are not coming into the business. The new ones are more desperate and have nothing, they are the ones turning to prostitution. ""People who end up alone, maybe who have had family members killed or who are in a very bad condition. ""They come into the business because the aid from the Government doesn't last for a long time. The rice, sugar, oil etc doesn't last for long so they end up with nothing and to earn money they go into prostitution."" The threat is not restricted to women and girls. Kasim says there is also a demand for younger children, both boys and girls. Aid agencies have warned for some time that vulnerable refugees are open to exploitation. Police checkpoints are in place around the site to stop Rohingya refugees being taken to nearby cities like Cox's Bazar and Chittagong. :: The Rohingya crisis explained But pimps like Kasim are ruthless people and have found ways of smuggling their victims out of the camps undetected. ""Now the chances are fewer than before as there's lots of security forces and check points,"" he said. ""Earlier, anyone could come and go easily but now they have to go through check points. Earlier they could have come easily but now it's a problem for the women. ""When they come they are asked where they are going and they lie about going to the market or Cox's Bazar or to visit relatives, and they cross the check points. ""Once they reach Cox's Bazar they move freely. The girls come for 15 or 30 days and then they go back. ""They stay here, 10 to 15 girls in one room and there are pimps like me also there. :: Inside the Rohingya refugee camps ""So we look for these type of girls in the camps. Many women come to me from Kutuapalong or other places, but they are all Rohingya. ""Some come here who don't have money or some come here whose husband has been killed or whose husband is in jail. ""For women who have two or three children they need money for their children's medicine."" The traffickers know exactly who to target. From the most desperate, they hunt the most vulnerable. ""The people who are poor and have four or five girls in the house, maybe they may have got one girl married and couldn't afford to get the other girls married because they need a large dowry."" he said. ""These sort of girls come to the business more. The single mothers and also the unmarried girls who are still at home, they are the ones who need the money the most."" Kasim said the trafficking of girls is not limited to Bangladeshi cities. He claimed to know of Rohingya women who have been sent to India and Pakistan."

Republic of Ireland manager and former Celtic boss Martin O'Neill voiced support for Miller ahead of the national team's World Cup play-off clash with Denmark. He told reporters: ""The news - we heard about it just recently, we didn't know how bad it was - and obviously all thoughts go out to him and his family. ""I think he's got three children as well. He's a very young man, 36 years of age. It puts things in perspective."" Miller made his professional debut for Celtic in 2000 after rising through the youth ranks, and helped them win the Scottish Premier League title in 2004. He joined Manchester United on a free transfer later that year, making 22 appearances under Sir Alex Ferguson in two seasons - which included a spell on loan at Leeds - before signing for Sunderland in 2006. In a post on Twitter, Celtic said: ""The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic Football Club are with Liam Miller and his family at this time.""

During the incident, the animal strayed on to the grounds of Monkspath Junior and Infant School as the animal's owner and officers tried to get it back under control. Police have since stressed that ""at no time"" were pupils and staff in any danger. According to the Birmingham Mail, the school had to go into ""lockdown"" after the animal, reportedly named Monk, made its way on to the school grounds.

2017-11-13,"Taylor Swift was nominated for six awards at the MTV EMAs, but received none. So has her latest album, Reputation, backfired?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171114005059/https://news.sky.com/story/has-taylor-swifts-reputation-ruined-her-legacy-11124705,"It's as hard for me to talk about Taylor Swift's reputation as it is to admit she has a legacy to protect. But she does. By winning Grammys and other accolades, leading an annoying ""squad"" of beautiful A-listers and sparking ""bad blood"" with anyone (or anything) who steps in her way, TayTay has certainly made a place for herself in the pantheon of mainstream songwriting. On Instagram, she has more than 100 million followers; on Spotify, she's back to breaking records; and her album out on Friday is still making headlines for how ""personal"" it is. But at the MTV Europe Music Awards she arrived with six nominations and left empty handed. Even in a ceremony presented by a bathrobe-wearing Rita Ora, this was still the biggest surprise of the night. Only made stranger by the fact that Eminem was crowned best hip-hop act before even releasing an album. ""I'm not really sure how I got this, 'cause I haven't had an album out in a few years',"" he said, awkwardly, on stage. ""I got one coming though"". :: Has Taylor Swift disappeared from social media? But even in a clumsy awards ceremony featuring the very worst that modern music has to offer, I still find it satisfying to see Taylor Swift getting snubbed. Especially, since her latest album - conveniently titled Reputation - is, in my opinion, the single most self-centred and hateful mix-tape ever released. From the first song to the last, her sixth studio outing is an attempt to - in her own lyrics - kill the ""old Taylor"" and come out as the ""bad reputation"" girl. But hasn't she already? For years, the public image of Taylor Swift has arguably been one of feuds and grudges and blacklists. On the industry front she went to war with Spotify over royalties, after stopping the streaming service from releasing her 2012 album Red. Two years after saying ""valuable things should be paid for"" - the rich singer's version of ""it's my party and I'll cry if I want to"" - she pulled all her music from Spotify. :: Shawn Mendes wins big at MTV Europe Music Awards This year, she admitted defeat. But even after making peace with Spotify, fans will still have to wait for one week to stream her whole album in any platform. With her previous record 1989, she withheld it from streaming for eight months. And it's not just streaming... Taylor's not crazy about journalists either. Earlier this month, her team of lawyers tried to silence a small-time blogger who criticised the singer for not addressing political issues. The blog post titled ""Swiftly to the alt-right: Taylor subtly gets the lower case kkk in formation"" also compared Swift's following to that of Adolf Hitler. The letter from Swift's lawyers, which threatened to sue the blogger if the post was not retracted, was criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union for an ""attempt to suppress constitutionally protected speech"". ""Intimidation tactics like these are unacceptable,"" ACLU said. Taylor's stand had backfired. On a personal level, the list is ever-growing. From Nicki Minaj to Kanye West and Katy Perry, from Calvin Harris to Harry Styles, TayTay's list of so-called haters is nearly as long as her legion of fans. And that's where her problem truly lies: The fans. The MTV EMAs differ from other industry awards, because they are voted on by fans. The mechanism allows mediocre acts to flourish, but it also mirrors the artist's true fan power - a much more accurate measure of success than the ever-fading charts. By snubbing her music, her fans could be showing they are over her attacks on her enemies and score-settling with former boyfriends. Even in the charts, her album is witnessing a sub-par performance in both the UK and the US. By evolving from sweet country icon to the wicked witch of pop, TayTay might have felt empowered and cool. By fighting with everyone and everything, she might have felt like a vigilante. Her huge fanbase might have helped enable all this, tweeting ""you go girl"" when she acted wrongly with others. They believed the sweet girl from Texas was standing up to abuse. Now it seems her fans are no longer buying it."

The proposed Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill will cover issues such as an agreement on citizens' rights, the UK's financial settlement and the details of a transitional period. Mr Davis told MPs: ""I can now confirm that once we have reached an agreement we will bring forward a specific piece of primary legislation to implement the agreement. ""This confirms that the major policy set out in the withdrawal agreement will be directly implemented into UK law by primary legislation, not by secondary legislation with the Withdrawal Bill. ""This also means that Parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinise and vote on the final agreement we strike with the EU. ""This agreement will only hold if Parliament approves it."" But pointless if we have enshrined a drop dead date in the Bill, & get a deal at 11th hour! Thereâd be no time! The move comes ahead of a pivotal week for the Government's other key Brexit legislation, with more than 400 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill - planned to convert EU law into UK law before March 2019 - ahead of its return to the House of Commons on Tuesday. Mr Davis's announcement appears to be a concession to pro-Remain Tories amid the threat of a rebellion causing a Government defeat. Conservative backbenchers previously warned they were ready to support an amendment demanding the UK's divorce deal is approved by an Act of Parliament. Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve, who brought the amendment, has revealed he and other Conservative MPs have recently been in talks with Downing Street over the legislation. But the Government's beefed-up promise for a parliamentary vote did not dispel concerns surrounding the EU Withdrawal Bill. Mr Davis confirmed MPs and peers will be given a take-it-or-leave-it choice on the Brexit deal, as he explained if Parliament rejects a withdrawal agreement, Britain will still leave the EU. Tory backbencher Heidi Allen branded Mr Davis's plan ""pointless"" as she also highlighted the Government's intention to alter legislation to state Britain's membership of the EU will formally end at 11pm on 29 March, 2019. She posted on Twitter: ""Pointless if we have enshrined a drop dead date in the Bill, & get a deal at 11th hour! There'd be no time! ""And also offers no safeguard if no deal is reached. Unacceptable."" Fellow Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach similarly labelled the Government's promise ""meaningless"" should Brexit talks slip beyond March 2019. Meanwhile, former Tory constitution minister John Penrose welcomed the Government's stronger pledge on a parliamentary vote, but expressed continuing concerns over the use of so-called ""Henry VIII powers"" as provided by the EU Withdrawal Bill. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer branded Mr Davis's actions ""a significant climbdown from a weak Government on the verge of defeat"". ""With less than 24 hours before they had to defend their flawed bill to Parliament they have finally backed down,"" he said. ""However, like everything with this Government the devil will be in the detail."" Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said a parliamentary vote ""simply isn't good enough"" as he repeated his party's call for a second EU referendum on the terms of a Brexit deal."

But it caused controversy after viewers believed they heard the burglar make the parting comment: ""F*** you, little bear."" M&S had said it was ""clear"" that the words were in fact ""thank you, little bear"". The UK's advertising watchdog has determined that the advert does not include a single swear word. A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which received three complaints about the ad, said: ""Whilst we appreciated that some viewers may have misinterpreted this, the ad did not contain a swear word and therefore did not break the rules."" He added: ""There were no grounds for an investigation."" The retailer worked with StudioCanal to create the festive advert, ahead of the release of the film Paddington 2. Featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw as Paddington, it also included a cameo appearance by veteran newsreader Angela Rippon."

Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, he pleaded guilty to one count of assault by beating. Kate Shilton, prosecuting, said the couple's taxi driver Daniel Shepherd described the punch as a ""left hook"" which caused Mrs Goldsmith to fall to the ground. She told the court the argument started in the back of the taxi before it escalated. ""They both got out of the taxi and he (Mr Shepherd) describes Mrs Goldsmith slapping her husband to the face,"" she said. ""He then describes how Mr Goldsmith punches her hard in the face using a left hook. ""Mrs Goldsmith has then fallen backwards. He says 'she appears to be unconscious, she isn't moving'."" The court was told how Mrs Goldsmith's eyes remained closed for about 15 seconds after being knocked to the ground before she woke up and staggered to her feet. Ms Shilton said: ""She (Mrs Goldsmith) then becomes upset, starts crying and uses some railings to assist her."" Goldsmith was described as becoming ""panicked and walking in and out of the house, trying to get her to go back in the house"". When the taxi driver challenged Goldsmith, he became aggressive, the court heard. Mrs Goldsmith then asked the driver to call the police. Goldsmith told officers he pushed his wife hard with his left hand and denied using a ""left hook"". The court heard the defendant was apologetic for his actions. He is due to be sentenced on 21 November. Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said: ""I am excluding custody and looking at a community order. ""But I am really looking at how to protect this lady from this man."" Carole Middleton - Kate's mother - is the older sister of Goldsmith, who attended the weddings of the Duchess and her sister Pippa."

But the measure is not going down well with some customers, with shop workers complaining they have received abuse. Suhail Ahmed, the decade-long owner of SPAR in St Mary Street, told Sky News: ""In most situations I don't think a retailer would need one, but over the summer Cardiff attracted a lot of street drinkers. The supermarkets provide very cheap alcohol. ""The law states that if someone is intoxicated, you're not allowed to serve them. The breathalyser is a tool and it provides clarification. We're a busy store and we use it when we have to, mostly on the street drinkers. ""I've seen some people moaning that it's unhygienic but you don't actually have to touch it - you can breathe into it easily without your lips touching it."" Another SPAR owner in the city, 40-year-old Rohat Hamed, said: ""We've used it hundreds of times already - we just grab it and if anybody who tries to buy alcohol looks drunk we tell them to blow into it. ""Some people have given us abuse when we use it because they must think that they're above the law."" Dr Kevin Smith, a senior lecturer at Cardiff University's School of Social Sciences, has questioned the stores' use of the breathalysers. He told Sky News that such measures were not the correct response to social issues in the city, including the abundance of rough sleepers. He said: ""If this is a way for SPAR owners to protect their employees from potential harm then that seems like a morally good response, but if it's something that's come from the police as part of a larger reaction to what they feel is antisocial behaviour, then that is something that is beyond the remit of a SPAR employee. ""You'll have all these Christmas dos coming up soon and if my friends and I went out in our suits and ties and want a can from the local SPAR, honestly, they are not going to breathalyse us. But they are going to breathalyse the people they think they fit the profile. ""We have suffered under a lot of austerity and it's trickled down. Rough sleeping is an everyday activity that people just accept, when it should be unacceptable. This larger, organised police response almost feels like the criminalisation of victims rather than a supportive way of dealing with it."" But South Wales Police's divisional commander for Cardiff, chief superintendent Belinda Davies, said: ""Complaints from visitors, residents and businesses around the number of people begging and undertaking alcohol-related anti-social behaviour within the city centre have increased in recent months. ""Such behaviour can prove intimidating, unpleasant and unwelcoming to those visiting or working in the area. ""Our action is intended to deal with persistent beggars and street drinkers, but also giving us the opportunity to engage with some of the more vulnerable members of the community, working with our partners to signpost a variety of help and support services available to them."" Eighteen people have also been arrested since the operation began, some for being drunk and disorderly."

It said huge disruption would follow for businesses, with food being left to rot in trucks at the border. In 2015, around 55 million custom declarations were made by 141,000 traders. That figure could increase five-fold to 255 million following the UK's exit from the EU, requiring the new system - the Customs Declaration Service (CDS) - to be in operation and Treasury funding secured for contingency options, according to MPs. It said: ""This is a programme of national importance that could have a huge reputational impact for the UK if it is not delivered successfully. ""The uncertainty regarding the outcome of UK-EU negotiations is a complicating factor but it should not be used by HMRC to avoid taking action now in areas including: scaling up the CDS to handle 255 million declarations; ensuring a viable contingency option is in place well before January 2019; and communicating with traders. ""There are financial as well as operational implications of not acting now. This is a tight timetable at the best of times. With the hard deadline of Brexit, delay is not an option."" Committee chair Meg Hillier MP said: ""Failure to have a viable customs system in place before the UK's planned exit from the EU would wreak havoc for UK business, trade and our international reputation. ""Confidence would collapse amid the potentially catastrophic effects."" Ms Hillier said HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was under ""considerable pressure"" to deliver the CDS on time, but does not have the funding to increase the capacity to deal with the ""consequences of Brexit - nor to develop contingency options"". It comes as MPs begin to debate the small print of the Government's Brexit legislation for eight days and nights between now and Christmas. The committee stage of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill gets under way with Labour and rebel Conservative MPs attempting to inflict a series of damaging defeats on Theresa May and Brexit Secretary David Davis. It will begin with four hours of debate on the precise timing of when the UK leaves the EU, followed by another four hours of debate on calls for a bigger Brexit role for the Scottish and Welsh governments."
2017-11-14,"Loud explosions have been heard in Zimbabwe's capital Harare after troops reportedly seized the state broadcaster, prompting speculation of a coup.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/military-vehicles-heading-towards-zimbabwe-capital-amid-political-purge-11126302,"The blasts came hours after military vehicles were seen heading towards the city after a military chief warned the army could ""step in"" amid a political row. The head of the armed forces General Constantino Chiwenga had demanded an end to a purge in the ruling ZANU-PF party after 93-year-old president Robert Mugabe fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa earlier this month. General Chiwenga said his forces may intervene if the removal from influential positions of key figures in Zimbabwe's 1970s liberation wars goes on. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are aware of reports of military vehicles moving on the outskirts of Harare. We are monitoring the situation closely and keeping travel advice under regular review. ""We advise any British national in Zimbabwe who may be concerned to monitor our travel advice for changes."" Mr Mnangagwa, 75, a veteran of the liberation wars, had been viewed as Mr Mugabe's probable successor. His sacking appeared to pave the way for Mr Mugabe's 52-year-old wife Grace to succeed him. Mr Mugabe is the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence. Reuters, AFP and AP witnesses said they saw several military vehicles, thought to be armoured personnel carriers, heading along roads towards the capital. Reuters said another two military vehicles had been seen parked beside the road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20 miles from the capital and Sky News has obtained pictures said to show caterpillar-track armed vehicles between Norton and Harare. It was not immediately clear why the vehicles were on the move, with analysts saying the vehicles may have been on routine manoeuvres. Soldiers were seen at the scene, but they refused to talk to journalists. A fruit seller near the shopping centre in Westgate, about six miles (10km) from central Harare, told AFP: ""I saw a long convoy of military vehicles... about an hour ago. I don't know where they were heading,"" On Monday, General Chiwenga said: ""We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in. ""The current purging ... targeting members of the party with a liberation background must stop forthwith,"" he said. Mrs Mugabe, 52, has a strong following in the powerful youth wing of ZANU-PF. Her rise has been seen as a challenge to the dominance of the independence-era war veterans, who previously held privileged positions in the ruling party under Mr Mugabe. The veterans, some of who took part in the civil war in the former British colony, have increasingly been prevented from holding senior government and party roles in recent years."
2017-11-14,"A Leave-supporting Labour MP has called on Theresa May to form a cross-party ""Brexit Cabinet"" in the spirit of Britain's government during the Second World War.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-mp-frank-field-urges-cross-party-war-cabinet-for-brexit-11126455,"Speaking as MPs began their line-by-line scrutiny of the EU Withdrawal Bill, Frank Field urged the Prime Minister to follow the example of Winston Churchill in the 1940s. Expressing his concern at the Government's handling of Brexit, the former Labour minister claimed there has not been ""the sense of importance, or drive, or coherence that this issue merits"". Having branded himself as a ""reluctant Brexiteer"", Mr Field added: ""Anyone serious about comparing this historic event to us fighting for survival in World War Two would have followed the move that Churchill made once he took over from [Neville] Chamberlain. ""He would have moved from the ramshackle way of existing institutions and he established a war cabinet. ""I believe... we need a Brexit cabinet - small, with the offer to the Opposition to be on it, as in war time which Mr [Clement] Attlee, Mr [Arthur] Greenwood accepted - that we actually try and have a national interest."" Mr Field spoke as he introduced his amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which is designed to convert EU legislation into UK law by March 2019. The veteran Birkenhead MP wants an exit date of 30 March 2019 included in the bill, which is an hour later than the Government's amendment proposing an exit date of 11pm on 29 March, 2019. Mr Field urged MPs to support his date, suggesting it means the UK would leave the EU ""on British time"", rather than a date that suits Brussels. He said: ""That's our choice, it's about the freedom, a little freedom, the beginnings of freedom that we hope will flow - with difficulties of course - by actually setting us on the course of leaving the EU."" During the debate, Remain-supporting Conservative backbenchers criticised the Government's amendment, with former chancellor Ken Clarke branding it ""utterly foolish"" and ""silly"". Ex-attorney-general Dominic Grieve also rejected the ""very strange"" amendment, adding: ""It seems to me to fetter the Government, to add nothing to the strength of the Government's negotiating position, and in fact potentially to create a very great problem that could be brought back to visit on us at a later stage."" Earlier, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer demanded the Government drop their own proposed exit date, which was announced at the weekend, from the bill. Branding the amendment a ""desperate gimmick"" by the Government, Sir Keir said: ""The Government's amendments to their own Bill would stand in the way of an orderly transition and increase the chance of Britain crashing out of Europe without an agreement. ""Theresa May should stop pandering to the 'no deal' enthusiasts in her own party and withdraw these amendments. If not, Labour will vote against them to support our own amendments and guarantee a transition that protects jobs and living standards."""
2017-11-14,"Fake Twitter accounts created by a Russian propaganda unit made a determined, co-ordinated attempt to interfere during the EU referendum, Sky News can reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/fake-twitter-accounts-targeting-eu-referendum-co-ordinated-by-russia-11126843,"A detailed analysis of Twitter accounts identified by the US senate as being linked to the Kremlin shows this activity before, during and after the Brexit vote in 2016. However, although co-ordinated, Russian activity appears to be at a much lower level than in the US presidential elections. The analysis was carried out by Yin Yin Lu, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Ms Lu cross-referenced a pre-existing database of 22.6 million tweets she created last year with the 2,752 accounts identified as creations of the Russian Internet Research Agency by the US senate. She found 416 tweets from the Russian usernames from March to July 2016, including during the referendum period itself. Ms Lu told Sky News: ""First of all the number of these tweets is important to highlight. So there's about 400 tweets here out of 22.6 million. That is a very infinitesimal fraction. So the word interference is perhaps a bit exaggerated."" However, those accounts appear to have co-ordinated strategically, retweeting each other to amplify their message and making much more use of photos and videos than normal Twitter users during the same period. ""There's some kind of network happening here,"" Ms Lu said. One of the accounts that most frequently tweeted was @TEN_GOP, or Tennesse GOP. The account had more than 16,008 followers before it was suspended by Twitter. It tweeted consistently pro-Leave tweets, including: Theresa May publicly warned Russia about election interference in a speech at Mansion House, saying: ""I have a very simple message for Russia. We know what you are doing. And you will not succeed."" The Russian embassy made this statement: ""The assertions are not brand new, but the main common point behind them is the irresponsible and groundless nature of accusations against Russia."" A Twitter spokesperson said: ""Twitter recognises that the integrity of the election process itself is integral to the health of a democracy. ""As such, we will continue to support formal investigations by government authorities into election interference where required."""
2017-11-14,Parliament's close procedural combat over Brexit has begun in earnest. All-night sittings and all-out battles between and within parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/twin-tightropes-for-theresa-may-amid-mps-close-brexit-combat-11126950,"It began surreally enough, with Labour's backbench Brexiteer Frank Field arguing about the precise hour of Brexit. His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."

""There are clearly existential threats to our country and they come in many forms,"" he said to the cross-party group of MPs. ""They come in the form of Daesh (Islamic State), who if they could, would find weapons of mass destruction and apply them to the UK. ""We are locked in a daily confrontation with Russia, the Prime Minister said so herself yesterday. ""We are looking at North Korea which within the next 12 to 18 months will make a nuclear missile to an intercontinental range ballistic missile that could reach London and we can't deal with that."" He added: ""We now live in an age where people who are not on our side have capability that they could, I'm not saying they will, but could, inflict on the UK homeland at short notice which we can't deal with."" Sir Richard had a long career in the Army which included tours of Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. As Commander of Joint Forces Command, he had responsibilities for all three armed services. He retired only last year, something which makes his comments all the more relevant and pointed. He said: ""The people who are in defenceâ¦they're never going to say publically, or to themselves, or to their enemy, or to their allies, that we're broken but when they fly, sail or deploy on the land and they look at their equipment, they look at their sustainability and they look at their shortfalls in training and they look at their allies, they know they are not fit for purpose."" General Barrons was giving evidence to the Defence Select Committee during a session about the ongoing national security review. The review is due to be published next year and will likely result in more cuts to the armed forces. Warning that the UK military is ""close to breaking"", the retired general said that unless the Government provides more money ""it will fall over"". He added: ""The first discussion in Government should be 'how much risk are we running in the world and what do we need to do to fix it?' ""They don't seem to want to have that discussion and so you end up with the risk of a ridiculous zero-sum discussion, both within a serviceâ¦and between the services which is why you end up with, currently, a Navy that is structurally underfunded, an Air Force that is holding together a bunch of very good equipment but really at the edge of their engineering and support capacity and an Army that is now broadly speaking 20 years out of date."""

He also secured a silver medal in the 5,000m, which ended an unbroken streak of 10 global final wins stretching back to 2011. On receiving his knighthood, Sir Mo said: ""I'm so happy to be awarded this incredible honour from the country that has been my home since I moved here at the age of eight."" The Somali-born runner, who has clinched 10 international titles, is now moving back to London from the United States to concentrate on running road marathons, having retired from the track after the championships in the capital. He split from controversial coach Alberto Salazar, who has been accused of breaking anti-doping rules while training athletes at the Nike Oregon Project, where Sir Mo had been coached since 2011. Mr Salazar is being investigated by the US Anti-Doping Agency and has denied any wrongdoing. Sir Mo has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is now working with Gary Lough, who previously coached women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe. Also due to receive an honour at the palace was Delia Smith, as a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for services to cookery, and Rosa Monckton, a friend of Princess Diana, receiving an MBE for voluntary and charitable services to people with learning difficulties and their families in the UK and abroad.

As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"
2017-11-14,"Grandparents pose a potential health risk to children and may even put them at  risk of cancer, scientists say.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/grandparents-may-pose-cancer-risk-to-children-scientists-warn-11127012,"The increased risk comes from the greater likelihood that grandmothers and grandfathers will spoil youngsters with treats. They are also more likely to expose them to second-hand tobacco smoke - a major cause of cancer, researchers say. Despite meaning well, grandparents were found to have a harmful effect on their grandchildren's health. Lead author Dr Stephanie Chambers, of the University of Glasgow's public health sciences unit, said: ""While the results of this review are clear that behaviour such as exposure to smoking and regularly treating children increases cancer risks as children grow into adulthood, it is also clear from the evidence that these risks are unintentional. ""Currently, grandparents are not the focus of public health messaging targeted at parents and in light of the evidence from this study, perhaps this is something that needs to change given the prominent role grandparents play in the lives of children."" The findings are based on a review of the impact grandparents can have on the lifestyle factors that are thought to increase the risk of cancer. The Glasgow team said they analysed data from 56 studies in 18 countries that examined the possible influence of grandparents on their grandchildren's health. Poor diet, excess weight, smoking and lack of physical activity are all known to increase the risk of cancer, said the researchers. Overall, grandparents were found to have a negative effect on children's health. The phenomenon is coming under increasing scrutiny as social trends - such as the growing proportion of women in the workforce, rising childcare costs, and increasing numbers of single parents - result in more children being placed in the care of their grandparents. The authors emphasised that none of the reviewed studies took account of the positive emotional benefit of children spending time with their grandparents. Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ""Finding a doting grandparent who is confident enough to follow rules laid down by mum and to the letter is frequently a rarity. ""The thought of losing children when out in the park may result in the kids being under house arrest - sweeties on demand and woefully short on exercise. ""Unfortunately... parents increasingly need to rely on this free form of childminding."""

But Mr Bailey dismissed the form of Ms Dent Coad's apology as a ""cowardly response"" and had written to Mr Corbyn demanding ""the strongest disciplinary action possible"". He was supported by Tory MPs James Cleverly and Kemi Badenoch, who also sent a letter to the Labour leader asking whether he will condemn Ms Dent Coad and suspend her pending an investigation. But, commenting on the row for the first time, Mr Corbyn insisted he is ""not going to withdraw the whip"" from Ms Dent Coad, who was elected to Parliament in June. ""I will obviously ensure people discuss the use of language with people,"" the Labour leader added. ""I will make sure everyone treats others with respect."" In the blog post, Ms Dent Coad claimed Mr Bailey - who was standing as a Conservative parliamentary candidate in Hammersmith at the time - had stigmatised the area by referring to it as a ""ghetto"". She wrote: ""Who can say where this man will ever fit in, however hard he tries? One day he is the 'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron, the next 'looking interested' beside G Osborne. Ever felt used?"" On Tuesday, Ms Dent Coad offered an apology to Mr Bailey, telling the BBC: ""If he was offended by me repeating what other people have said then I do apologise. ""Clearly, I shouldn't have repeated it. People have taken it the wrong way."" But, criticising Ms Dent Coad's response, Mr Bailey accused her of attempting to ""blur and camouflage the views she expressed in her blog by falsely dressing them up as someone else's words"". He added: ""Despite her claims, she can provide no evidence that I or anyone else used the horrendous terms she advocated."" The Guido Fawkes website has since published a further 2010 blogpost from Ms Dent Coad, in which a stick figure being hanged features alongside the caption ""new logo needed for Tories"". In their letter to Mr Corbyn, Mr Cleverly and Mrs Badenoch also called on Mr Corbyn to address Labour's ""condescending attitude to BAME voters and candidates"". They highlighted a Twitter post by Labour MP Clive Lewis, in which he told a fellow user: ""If you think you can fight racism and be in the Tory party then I guess this conversation isn't going to go very far."" The pair also referred to Mr Corbyn's claim during June's General Election campaign that ""only Labour can be trusted to unlock the talent of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people."" Ms Dent Coad previously sparked controversy with her comments about the Royal Family during the Labour party conference in September."

Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said one child had been shot at the school and another was shot in a truck with a woman who was also wounded. He told reporters: ""Multiple shots were fired in Rancho Tehama. That evolved into multiple victims and multiple shots at the elementary school."" Investigators recovered a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns following the shootings which were first reported at around 8am local time (4pm GMT). Sky News' US correspondent Greg Milam said the school did not appear to be the primary target and the shootings began with a domestic violence incident at a house. Police believe the attacker opened fire at seven locations, he said. Brian Flint told local newspaper, the Record Searchlight, that his neighbour carried out the attack and his roommate was among the victims.

But, the amendment was defeated 318-52 as MPs continue their line-by-line scrutiny of the bill. Later, on the first day of the bill's committee stage in the House of Commons, the Government also comprehensively won a vote (318-68) on the bill's provision for the 1972 European Communities Act to be repealed on exit day. Nineteen Labour MPs voted against repealing the Act, which currently gives EU law supremacy over UK national law, in March 2019. More than 400 amendments have been tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which is designed to convert EU law into UK legislation by the end of March 2019. The Government has been warned of potential rebellions during the bill's lengthy committee stage, with Conservative backbenchers having raised concerns about the use of so-called ""Henry VIII"" powers. On Tuesday, prominent Remain-supporting Tories also focused their anger on an amendment tabled by the Government itself, which would include an EU exit date of 11pm on 29 March, 2019 within the legislation. Labour MP Frank Field has withdrawn his own amendment calling for an exit date of 30 March 2019, an hour later than the Government's amendment, without a vote. Ex-chancellor Ken Clarke - who was afforded rare applause in the House of Commons by Labour MPs at one point during Tuesday's debate - branded the Government amendment ""ridiculous and unnecessary"", adding: ""It could be positively harmful to the national interest."" Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve described the Government's action as ""mad"" as he vowed to vote against the ""unacceptable"" proposal. And Tory backbencher Anna Soubry could be heard calling her fellow Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin a ""disgrace"" as he told the House of Commons: ""Any MPs who voted for Article 50 but then do not want to fix the date are open to the charge that they don't want us to leave the EU."" As MPs debated the EU Withdrawal Bill, the Prime Minister met with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Downing Street. The SNP leader described her talks with Theresa May as ""constructive and cordial"" but repeated her view the EU Withdrawal Bill is unacceptable to the Scottish Government in its current form. Both Scotland's and Wales' devolved governments have expressed fears the ""power grab"" legislation will return responsibilities from Brussels to London, rather than to their countries' administrations. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We oppose Brexit but we understand withdrawal legislation is necessary, so we want to find agreement. ""But I also made clear what our bottom lines are on that bill. ""Discussions will continue and hopefully we can reach some points of agreement in the weeks to come."" The First Minister also branded the Government's exit date amendment, which won't be voted on by MPs until next month at the earliest, as not ""sensible""."

2017-11-14,"A number of ""smart"" toys expected to be top sellers this Christmas have ""concerning vulnerabilities"" that could be exploited by hackers, a consumer group has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/parents-issued-christmas-warning-over-security-of-smart-toys-11126027,"Which? has written to retailers calling on them to stop selling the Furby Connect, i-Que Intelligent Robot, Toy-Fi Teddy, Cloud Pets and other connected devices with security issues. The product testing firm said ""very little technical know-how"" is needed to access the toys, which are designed to allow children to send and receive messages. Which? found that the connections on the children's products are unsecured, meaning they can be accessed without a password, PIN code or any other authentication. Anyone within 10 to 30 metres of Hasbro's Furby Connect can connect via Bluetooth when it is switched on, with no physical interaction required and no security measures obstructing the pairing process. Hasbro said manipulating the toy as Which? had done would require ""a number of very specific conditions that would all need to be satisfied"", but added that it took the report ""very seriously"". For the i-Que robot, anyone is able to use its voice to talk after downloading the associated app and finding one of the toys within Bluetooth range. Vivid Imaginations, which distributes the robot on behalf of manufacturer Genesis, downplayed fears over its security, adding that its toys fully comply with the Toy Safety Directive and European standards. But it said it would be ""communicating the issues"" to Genesis and ""actively purse the matter with them directly"". Spiral Toys, the maker of Cloud Pets and Toy-Fi Teddy, has declined to comment on the concerns raised. Which? found that anyone can play voice messages through both products after connecting through Bluetooth, with the teddy even allowing children to send responses. Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which?, said: ""Connected toys are becoming increasingly popular but, as our investigation shows, anyone considering buying one should apply a level of caution. ""Safety and security should be the absolute priority with any toy. ""If that can't be guaranteed, then the products should not be sold."""
2017-11-14,Ikea has increased prices on some of its products in the UK as a result of higher import costs after the slump in sterling following the Brexit vote.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/ikea-raises-uk-prices-after-imports-hike-following-brexit-referendum-11126326,"The Swedish firm hiked prices by 3.6% in some areas to counter a 13.7% jump in the cost of imports. Ikea revealed its boosted prices after it gave an update on its UK performance, with total sales rising 6% to Â£1.8bn in 2017. The flat-pack furniture retailer said it increased its share of the market by 0.5%, bringing it closer to a projected target of 15% market share by 2027. Retail manager for Ikea UK and Ireland Gillian Drakeford said: ""Despite a level of economic uncertainty, our brand is even more relevant and we continue our efforts to bring affordable, well-designed home furnishing solutions to the UK. ""The Brexit vote has been on everyone's lips and the devaluation of the pound has been a challenge for many businesses. ""As we import a lot of our products from overseas, this increased our costs by 13.7%. To keep our range accessible and affordable for the many, we absorbed most of these costs, increasing prices by just 3.6%."" Ikea said it created 1,000 jobs this year despite the Brexit vote and planned to recruit 850 workers when it launches stores in Greenwich and Exeter. The firm, which has 20 branches around the UK employing 10,900 people, said it saw a boost in online sales as it grew 10% since it launched last year."
2017-11-14,Coca-Cola has been accused of undermining efforts to cut childhood obesity by targeting children in the poorest parts of the country with its Christmas truck promotional tour.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/coca-cola-slammed-over-uk-wide-christmas-truck-tour-amid-child-obesity-fears-11126390,"Health watchdog Public Health England (PHE) said the campaign, in which free drinks will be handed out from the distinctive red trucks at 42 locations across the country, is ""the last thing children need"". The Coca-Cola trucks are modelled on the company's well-known Christmas television adverts and will visit cities and towns across the UK. According to the company's website, visitors will be able to enjoy ""a snowy winter wonderland setting while enjoying a choice of Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke or Coca-Cola Zero Sugar"". In a statement, PHE director Dr Alison Tedstone singled out the campaign, saying local authorities should consider whether to allow the trucks to operate. She highlighted the link between obesity and deprivation and noted the Coca-Cola trucks will visit some of the poorest areas in the country. ""Among many others, Coca-Cola has announced the dates for its 2017 Christmas Truck tour, which will see its trucks roll into towns and cities up and down the UK, giving free drinks to families and young children,"" she said. ""We're encouraging local authorities to have conversations about how marketing campaigns like this involving free sugary drinks is compatible with bringing down concerning rates of obesity and dental decay in children. ""The link between childhood obesity and deprivation is well established and it's important to note the truck will be visiting some of our poorest areas. ""We know many local authorities are committed to improving the health of their children and many specifically to helping address childhood obesity. We are seeing positive action from schools, where healthy eating is embedded in everyday life, and there are local initiatives to encourage more physical activity, use of green spaces and healthy cooking and eating. ""To really help children and families embrace these positive lifestyles, we need consistent messaging that supports them to make healthier choices. ""Our environment is already driving us all to eat and drink too much. With our town centres already overcrowded with outlets promoting sugar and excess calories, this is the last thing children need."" Earlier this year the Government introduced a tax on drinks containing added sugar that is estimated to raise more than Â£500m in its first year, which will be used to fund school sport. PHE is responsible for implementing the Government's anti-obesity strategy, and this year introduced new sugar reduction guidelines for confectionery, breakfast cereals and other foods. ""Government is committed to making the Soft Drinks Industry Levy and the sugar and calorie reduction programmes a success. In years to come, we are confident we will look back and see these as historic steps in reducing one of the biggest modern threats to our children's health,"" Dr Tedstone said. ""It is important that we address actions that could undermine this vital work, which is why we want to encourage debate and support local areas to make positive choices for the health of their children."" A spokesperson for Coca-Cola said: ""The truck tour is a one off, annual event where we offer people a choice of 150ml samples of Coca-Cola Classic, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar or Diet Coke - so two of the three options are no sugar drinks. ""This is also reflected in the take-up of samples on the truck tour - with on average over 70% of what we sample being a zero sugar option."""
2017-11-14,"A woman who spent time in the same jail where a British mother is being held accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government has revealed the torture, sexual abuse and threats she endured as a teenager in the ""black hole of evil"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/stuck-in-a-black-hole-of-evil-my-torture-in-same-iranian-prison-as-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-11125738,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is currently serving a five-year prison sentence after being arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 as she attempted to return home from a visit to see her family. She is being held at Evin Prison which Amnesty International has criticised for denying prisoners medical care and proper food, while human rights campaigners in Iran have described its curbs on visiting rights ""cruel"". There is nothing to suggest she is being tortured, but ex-inmate Marina Nemat tells Sky News of the horrifying treatment she endured in the women's wing at the jail: :: One day, I looked around me, and I had lost my freedom, my family, my religion, my name, and my dignity Two members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard came for me on January 15, 1982, and arrested me at home in Tehran. I was 16-years-old. It was about nine or 10 o'clock at night. They put me in a car and drove me north to Evin Prison - a compound that has many buildings in a large area north of Tehran surrounded by tall brick walls, barbed wire, and guards with guns. I was blindfolded upon arrival and taken in. They took me along hallway after hallway after hallway. I couldn't see much, but I could see that there were many people sitting by the walls along the hallway. I was told to sit on the floor and wait. It was very quiet. Eventually, someone called my name, and I was taken for interrogation. A door closed behind me and I was told to sit. I couldn't see the man questioning me because I was still blindfolded. ""Have you attended protest rallies against the government?"" he asked. I said I had. It was not some state secret. I went to rallies almost every day after school with my friends. My parents knew, the principal knew, the shopkeepers knew. I didn't wear a ski mask on the streets of Tehran. What was the point of lying? ""Have you written articles against the Government?"" he said. ""Yes, in my school newspaper."" He wanted to know the whereabouts of a girl who I hardly knew. I didn't know where she was. :: Boris Johnson apologises to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe over 'anguish' They took me to another room where they took off my blindfold. I was in a small room with two men: Ali and Hamehd. There was a desk, two chairs, and a bare wooden bed. They handcuffed me and noticed that my hands would easily slide out of the cuffs without much effort. I was about 6.4 stone (40.8kg). They laughed and put both my wrists into one cuff, and, as it clicked, my right wrist cracked. The torture had not even begun yet. I screamed. At that point, if the devil appeared and asked me to sell him my soul and he would return me home to my mum, I would. I would have sold my soul with whipped cream and a cherry on top. I would have done anything to get out of that room. They tied me to the bare wooden bed. I was lying down on my stomach. They lashed the soles of my feet with a length of cable that looked like a garden hose but was not hollow. This is the most common method of torture in the Middle East. Why? Because our nerve ends are in our feet. With every strike, my nervous system would explode, and then it was magically put back together again, and I was wide awake for the next. A place beyond pain. I began to count the strikes, but I forgot how to count. They eventually stopped beating me and made me sit up. I looked at my feet, and I laughed out loud. My feet looked like overgrown party balloons with toes on them, indigo blue. I looked like a cartoon character. They thought I was resisting, so they beat me more. Torture is not really designed to get information, because the tortured tells the torturer what he wants to hear; torture is designed to kill the human soul. When they succeed, they stop. If they don't, then they will execute you. And they are not trying to just kill your soul, they are trying to kill the soul of your family and your country and the world. This is why torture is a crime against humanity. :: Boris Johnson 'endangered' Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's life I was sent to 246, a public women's cellblock in Evin, where I was with a few of my school friends and many other young women. There was another form of torture in Evin. Sometimes girls were called for interrogation at midnight and they were returned to the cellblock at 5am with no visible torture signs. If you knew the girl, you would go up to her and ask, ""Where were you last night?"" And she would give you some lame excuse like, ""They took me for interrogation and nothing happened"". Yeah, right. That didn't happen in Evin. But then she would give you the look that said, ""Get lost. I don't want to talk about this"". So you would respect your friend and go away. They called me for interrogation about five months after my arrest. It was daytime. My interrogator Ali was there. He took off my blindfold and looked me straight in the eye. ""Listen carefully,"" he said. ""You had a death sentence for being an enemy of God. I reduced it to life in prison. You're going to be in prison forever and nobody cares. ""You'll become my wife, or I'll arrest your parents and your boyfriend."" I knew he was serious. I knew anything could happen in Evin. If he arrested my parents, I wouldn't have a home to go back to. ""I'll do anything you ask. Just leave my family alone,"" I said. He told me I had to convert to Islam from Christianity. I did. He even changed my name. One day, I looked around me, and I had lost my freedom, my family, my religion, my name, and my dignity. How much more can you take away from a person? I was being raped over and over again in solitary confinement in Evin at the age of 17, and it was absolutely legal. I couldn't even complain about it. The conditions in Evin Prison have not changed a great deal since I was there in the 80s. Torture and sexual abuse are still widely used. I have campaigned for the release of many Evin prisoners. Some of them have been released, but others are still there. People ask me how and why I survived. When I was stuck in a black hole of evil made by men, I needed to remember that even though it seemed that the world had forgotten my friends and me, there were still people out there who cared about us. My cellmates helped me remember that. I was released in March 1984, more than two-years after my arrest. I take this opportunity to remind Nazanin Ratcliffe, Saeed Malekpur, and other Evin prisoners that they are not forgotten. We care. We're doing our best to make sure the world knows about their ordeal and does its best to bring them home. Do not lose hope. :: Marina Nemat was incarcerated in Evin Prison from 1982-1984 for her views against the Iranian Revolution. She escaped to Canada in 1991 and regularly speaks about her experiences to students as well as at the annual Oslo Freedom Forum. She has written in support of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but is not alleging the British mother has been tortured. Visit her website."
2017-11-14,Nobody has had to fight a war quite like this one.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/the-ticking-bombs-islamic-state-left-behind-in-iraq-11126145,"A transnational group of religious fanatics rolled over Iraq's borders in 2014 with jeeps and guns and an all-pervasive claim on the Islamic faith. From the old al Nuri Mosque in Mosul, the self-declared caliph of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, declared himself leader of all Muslims and promised to conquer the West. The war did not work out the way al Baghdadi envisaged. Islamic State fighters were killed or scattered by Iraqi and Kurdish soldiers and coalition airpower. But the allied victory has come at an incalculable cost. More than 40,000 people died in Mosul alone and large parts of Iraq have been wrecked. :: Drone footage shows sinkhole that became Islamic State mass grave:: IS jihadists fight from Syrian desert after losing last stronghold Along with the destruction and the oversize refugee camps and a lack of basic services, Islamic State fighters have left something else for Iraqi officials to deal with - their wives and children. Officials told Sky News they are currently holding 3,000 IS family members, including 1,750 foreign women and children. These foreign nationals have been detained in a high-security prison in a town called Tal Keif, 10 kilometres northeast of Mosul. The conditions are poor - the prison's capacity is 500 - and officials from the interior ministry in Baghdad told us they are trying to convince home countries to take some of them back. But the chief adviser to the ministry, Dr Wahab Altaey, says it has been a struggle. ""The majority of countries have not responded to us in a positive manner. They did not accept the idea of receiving the dependents - the wives. The boys are considered to be ticking bombs."" Dr Wahab accepts that some IS family members, who come from dozens of different countries, will never return home. ""We are trying to divide them into groups - those that can be extradited and those who will remain in Iraq. We have to deal with them all (of them) in a humane manner."" Sky News was given permission to speak to four Europeans currently held at Tal Keif. It was soon clear to us that some women had embraced life under Islamic State. Kheda, a mother-of-three from Hamburg in Germany, told us why she joined IS: ""We were wearing the burqa in Germany because it is not forbidden but they were making fun of us, insulting us. ""They asked us, 'Why do you hang around like that?' But no one can criticise our burqas or our covering up."" Yevgenia from Volgograd in Russia said she too preferred the self-declared Islamic caliphate. She said: ""You wear black, you take care of your kids and people don't push you or point fingers at you when you go to the market. There was no problem there."" I asked her whether she knew about the atrocities, executions and sheer terror perpetrated by Islamic State. The mother added: ""Tell me honestly, how would you describe people who drop bombs on civilians? How many women and children were killed? It's a controversial thing when you ask who are the terrorists."" While Yevgenia and Kheda's comments and combativeness will raise concerns with many, there is no international strategy to deal with people like them. Instead, most countries prefer to ignore the issue - the rehabilitation and reintegration of returnees is simply considered too difficult. In contrast, a French prisoner called Jamelah told us she was revolted by her experience with IS. She claimed that she had been tricked by her husband into taking a holiday in Turkey. Instead, he was preparing for a life of jihad in Syria. ""I wanted to escape but it was impossible. After three days in Istanbul I knew it was impossible. I had no mobile, no internet, what can I do? He did training in Raqqa, 36 days. (Then) they decided where they needed families. If they needed men in Mosul, they brought all families to Mosul."" Jamelah and her daughter were part of a group who surrendered to Kurdish fighters in Tal Afar in July. She told me she has received one phone call from French consular officials and described the situation as hopeless. ""All my life is prison. What can I do? What can I say? I am tired. Really. Up until now my life is prison. I want to be strong, not for me, just for my daughter."" There seems little prospect that Jamelah and the other foreign nationals (1,050 children and 700 women) will be released soon - despite the interior ministry's intentions. A senior Iraqi military official told Sky News he considered these women and children to be terrorist threats. Their continued incarceration was necessary, he added, to prevent members of the local Sunni community from aiding in their escape. Nobody has had to fight a war like this - and no one, it seems, knows how to deal with the aftermath. The Iraqi government is split and the international community has turned its back - while 3,000 outcasts remain behind bars."
2017-11-14,A man who sold illegally imported guns and homemade bullets to criminal gangs has been convicted of supplying lethal weapons.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171115010358/https://news.sky.com/story/pensioner-convicted-of-supplying-guns-and-ammunition-to-criminal-gangs-11126357,"Paul Edmunds, 66, had turned his home in a middle class suburb of Gloucester into an ammunition factory. The licensed gun dealer used his ""encyclopaedic knowledge"" of firearms legislation to exploit loopholes and smuggle hundreds of banned weapons from the US. In a case that will raise questions about current gun importation laws, Edmunds was able to walk through customs at Heathrow airport with weapons he was supplying to criminals. Lying to officials about the age of guns, he falsely claimed many were antiques and therefore allowed in the UK because there is no commercially available ammunition. One Colt pistol brought through Heathrow in November 2013 was used to murder a man in a shooting at Avalon nightclub in west London just a month later. The genuine antique weapons imported by Edmunds were converted by him into killing machines because he was able to manufacture bullets. When police raided his home in Hardwicke they found tens of thousands of rounds stored in his attic, garage and bedroom. Ammunition made by him was recovered at the scenes of more than 100 shootings, including the murders of Birmingham men Derek Myers and Kenichi Phillips and the targeting of a West Midlands Police helicopter during the riots in 2011. He was eventually caught after ballistics experts linked ammunition from dozens of crime scenes. Greg Taylor from the National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) told Sky News that bullets made in the same mound will share characteristics. ""The finished product will have tool markings on them at various stages and on various components,"" he explained. ""It is these tool markings that ultimately allow us to forensically link batches of ammunition that have been recovered from crime."" Edmunds used a middle man, respected physiotherapist Mohinder Surdhar, 58, who he had met at a gun fair, to supply his weapons and ammunition to criminal gangs. Surdhar admitted his part in the plot. Detective Constable Phil Rodgers from West Midlands Police Force CID, who led the investigation, likened the pair to unlikely crooks Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from hit TV show Breaking Bad. ""They were like the Breaking Bad of the gun world. ""On the face of it, both decent men but using their skills and expertise to provide deadly firearms. ""But this was no TV drama, these were real weapons, real bullets, real victims. ""Their actions have had a devastating impact on communities by fuelling violent crime, leading to fear and bloodshed. ""Our investigation has undoubtedly prevented many more firearms and countless rounds of ammunition getting into criminal hands and in all likelihood saved lives."" Marcia Shakespeare, whose daughter Letisha was shot dead in 2003, an innocent victim of a drive-by gang related shooting, told Sky News the case raises serious questions about current gun licensing laws. ""They need to update licences now there's been a loophole where... people are going to different countries and actually bringing in those firearms. ""So I think, definitely, policing on firearms licenses needs to be changed."""

During a House of Commons grilling, Mr Johnson told MPs: ""The British Government has no doubt Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran on holiday and that was the sole purpose of her visit. ""My remarks on the subject before the Foreign Affairs Committee could and should have been clearer and I acknowledge that the words I used were open to being misinterpreted, and I apologise. ""I apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family if I have inadvertently caused them any further anguish."" Mr Johnson's comments about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have sparked fears the 38-year-old could face a longer jail sentence. Both the Iranian judiciary and media have used the Foreign Secretary's words as justification for her imprisonment, leading to calls for Mr Johnson to resign. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who forced Mr Johnson to face MPs on Monday with her urgent question, took issue with the Foreign Secretary's suggestion his comments were ""misinterpreted"" as she demanded he ""unequivocally"" state he ""simply got it wrong"". She told the Foreign Secretary his ""pride matters not one ounce compared to Nazanin's freedom"". Responding, Mr Johnson said: ""Of course I apologise for the distress and suffering that has been caused by the impression that I gave that the Government believe, and I believe, that she was there in a professional capacity. ""She was there on holiday. I do apologise, and of course I retract any suggestion that she was there in a professional capacity."" Under further pressure from Labour MPs to confess to an error, Mr Johnson acknowledged his ""mistake"" and admitted: ""It was wrong of me to say she was there in a professional capacity."" Following Mr Johnson's appearance in the House of Commons, Mrs Zagahri-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told Sky News he would not be joining demands for the Foreign Secretary to resign. ""It's important that the Foreign Secretary stays to see it through and brings Nazanin home,"" he said. Mr Ratcliffe stressed he did not want to be seen as ""some sort of political agitator"" in Iran, which could allow the regime to ""build a conspiracy"". But Mr Ratcliffe did reveal his anger with the Government's handling of his wife's case, adding: ""Don't get me wrong, I've not always been happy with the Government, the Government knows that behind closed doors, the Government knows that on the media and so on. ""I'm pretty transparent about that. But at the same time I'm not trying to push for anyone to lose their job, I'm just trying to bring Nazanin home."" Monique Villa, the chief executive of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's employers, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, also backed away from calling for Mr Johnson to go. Ahead of Mr Johnson's planned visit to Tehran in the next few weeks, she told Sky News: ""Boris Johnson now has a mission and I want him to execute on his mission. ""He's certainly the right person now to go and compensate for the enormous harm he has done."" Ms Villa revealed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works as a project manager for the charitable arm of the Thomson Reuters news agency, is ""now very seriously worried"" about lumps she has found on her breasts. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran's capital since April last year, when she was arrested at Tehran airport as she attempted to return home together with her young daughter, Gabriella. She is accused of plotting to overthrow the country's regime. Downing Street has said offering Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection is ""one of the options"" being considered. The Government's response to her plight came in for renewed scrutiny on Sunday after Environment Secretary Michael Gove said he did not know why Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran when she was arrested."

A 19-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of murder after officers raided two homes in Swanage on Monday. Investigators say that both the man and the woman are known to Miss Pope. Both have now been released under investigation. A wide scale search is under way, with the coastguard and volunteers from Dorset Search and Rescue and Wessex 4x4 helping officers from Dorset Police. In a statement issued through the force, Miss Pope's family said: ""If anyone knows where Gaia is we beg you to let us know.""To Gaia. We all love you forever. We miss you beyond words. We will find you darling girl. ""The thought of seeing the sunshine of your smile again soon keeps us all going and hoping."" In their statement, Miss Pope's family thanked volunteers and emergency services involved in the search for the teenager, who had been staying at an address in Swanage before she vanished. ""The massive effort to find Gaia has been great comfort in what everyone will understand is a deeply worrying and scary experience for all who love Gaia so deeply,"" the family added. ""We understand that the police continue to investigate all possible scenarios, and we want to emphasise that the search for Gaia continues. ""We are aware of the arrests that have taken place but want to emphasise that these must not put a stop to the search until or unless there is a definite conclusion."" CCTV captured Miss Pope running along the pavement on Morrison Road in Swanage at around 4pm. She was running in the direction of a house in Manor Gardens. The last reported sighting of her was at an address in Manor Gardens shortly after. At the time she was said to be wearing a red checked shirt with white buttons, grey and white woven leggings and white trainers. Describing her disappearance as ""completely out of character"", police now believe ""she may have come to harm""."
2017-11-15,Scotland is set to become the first country in the world to impose a minimum price for alcohol in a bid to improve public health.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171116012842/https://news.sky.com/story/scotland-gets-all-clear-for-minimum-alcohol-pricing-as-judges-reject-appeal-11127380,"Measures proposed as part of the Alcohol Minimum Pricing Act, first voted for by Scottish MPs in May 2012, can finally be implemented after years of legal challenges and appeals by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA). Seven Supreme Court judges voted unanimously on Wednesday to back the unprecedented legislation, which will impose a minimum price on alcohol in Scotland of 50p per unit. It means that a 70cl bottle of whisky cannot be sold for less than Â£14. For years Scottish ministers have attempted to hike alcohol prices in a bid to tackle a perceived binge-drinking problem, but the SWA had slammed the proposal as ""ineffective and illegal"" and took its battle against the measures to court. Its initial failure in May 2013 led to an appeal, with the case referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court of Session, before the SWA was given the go-ahead to take it to the Supreme Court in July. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Scottish government's proposal ""is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"" and fully complies with EU law. Once the measures are imposed, a 70cl bottle of 37.5% vodka will not go for less than Â£13.13 and a 75cl bottle of 12.5% wine cannot be sold for less than Â£4.69. Four 440ml cans of 9% lager will now cost a minimum of Â£7.92. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who first pitched a minimum price of 45p per unit in September 2010, said she was ""absolutely delighted"" with the court's decision. Absolutely delighted that minimum pricing has been upheld by the Supreme Court. This has been a long road - and no doubt the policy will continue to have its critics - but it is a bold and necessary move to improve public health. The makers of Tennent's Lager and Magners Cider, C&C Group, have also backed the measures. ""It is the right move to make, a progressive step forward in tackling the problems of alcohol misuse in Scotland, and we congratulate the Scottish government on its perseverance,"" a spokesperson said. Alcohol Focus Scotland says that in the first year alone, minimum pricing could prevent 60 alcohol-related deaths, 1,600 hospital admissions and 3,500 crimes."

It marks the first time year-on-year comparisons of employment levels based on nationality have be made following the EU referendum in June last year. While EU employment rose, overall UK employment fell by 14,000 to just over 32 million in the three months to September, according to the ONS. Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of campaign group Migration Watch UK, said the figures ""show that predictions of a Brexodus - an outflow of EU workers - are nonsense"". Matt Hughes, ONS senior statistician, said: ""The number of non-UK nationals in work is still rising, albeit more slowly than in the last couple of years. ""However, this is being driven by EU citizens; the number of non-EU nationals working in the UK has fallen in the last year."" :: Job numbers slip back as pay squeeze deepens Much of the increase has been down to more Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK. In the third quarter of this year, 347,000 nationals from the two countries worked in the UK - an increase of 90,000 compared with the same period in 2016. Citizens from the two eastern European countries have only been allowed to work in the UK since 2014, after they became EU members in 2007. There was also a surge in the number of employees from long-standing members Germany, France, Italy and Spain, from 942,000 to 987,000. Workers from eight central and eastern European countries have fallen. During the last period there was an estimated 1.035 million employees from the EUA8 countries which joined the union in 2004. There were 20,000 fewer workers from these countries, which include the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Overseas workers from outside the EU fell by 23,000 to 1.21 million. The ONS report said: ""Since January to March 2009, the number of non-UK nationals from outside the EU working in the UK has been broadly flat but the number of non-UK nationals from EU countries working in the UK has continued to increase."" Statistics published earlier this year revealed EU migrants account for up to one in 10 employees in some sectors."

The Government survived four other votes on day two of the flagship bill's committee stage, during which MPs examine proposed legislation in fine detail. But in a sign of potential trouble brewing, Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned laws safeguarding such rights would be brought to the ""lowest possible status"" in Parliament once Britain's EU exit takes effect. He told the Commons that legislation of ""considerable importance"" would be weakened under the bill, which is designed to convert EU law into UK legislation by the end of March 2019. Shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook said secondary legislation could be used to ""chip away at rights, entitlements, protections and standards that the public enjoy and wish to retain"". Labour wanted to ensure that retained EU law could only be changed through primary legislation, which requires full debates in the chamber. Mr Grieve said: ""He's right about that - that is the curiosity of this legislation, that taking laws which we would regard for the most part in this country of being of very considerable importance if you were to speak to them, to raise the issues with the public, are being brought to the lowest possible status on their return here and without there really being an opportunity for obvious reasons for us to revisit this issue domestically in a way which might lead us to enacting fresh legislation."" Mr Grieve said later in the debate that he wanted an assurance from the Government that the issue was being looked at, but said Labour's proposed change had ""problems of its own"". He continued: ""I put the Government on notice that we are going to have to draw together the issues that we're debating today. ""And indeed I'm convinced it will be similar issues next week, all of which derive from the same problem, as to the way the Government has approached this and drafted this legislation at the moment, and it must be remedied."" Solicitor General Robert Buckland said Brexit would ""in no way whatsoever be used to undermine or curtail the rights of workers that have been enshrined both in domestic law and in law by virtue of the EU"". More than 400 amendments have been tabled to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, with the first opposition amendments to the flagship legislation defeated on Tuesday. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mrs May said she was ""listening carefully to those who wish to improve the bill"". The PM added: ""I hope that we can all come together to deliver on the decision that the country took that we should leave the European Union."""

Walls have been swept away, buildings collapsed and roads filled with rubble, as cars and trucks were thrown across streets and into fences. Among the worst affected areas were the towns of Mandra, Nea Peramos and Megara, in semi-rural areas close to Athens, as well as the Pindus mountain range where Mount Olympus is located. ""This is a biblical disaster,"" Mandra mayor Yianna Krikouki told state broadcaster ERT. ""Everything is gone."" The bodies of some of those killed were recovered by coastguards, and authorities believe at least two - men in their 50s and 80s - were lifted from their homes by the waters and swept into the sea. Older people who were found dead inside their homes were also among the casualties. Tornadoes were also reported in Italy and the Turkish coastal city of Antalya. In Greece rainfall has hit an average of 50mm and locally up to 400mm. The weather has been very unsettled across the central #Mediterranean, here's a look at what's been happening pic.twitter.com/FxGovLtyS9 Sky News Weather Producer Rebecca Yussuf said the extreme conditions have been caused by a persistent cut off low and strong Scirocco winds. ""There's a persistent low in the southern-central Mediterranean generating strong Scirocco winds, which have pulled warm, moist air across Italy and the Balkan Peninsula"" she said. ""That has been forced upwards by the mountains in northern and western Greece, causing torrential rainfall and flash flooding there."" A state of emergency was declared in the small Aegean island of Symi, close to the Turkish coast, after heavy rains flooded homes and shops and created electricity cuts when the local power station was flooded. Grigoris Stamoulis, the mayor of Nea Peramos on the east coast, told television reporters that ""practically the entire town"" had been overcome by the waters. ""I don't think we've ever seen such flooding before,"" he said. It is thought that poor infrastructure has worsened the situation in a country where torrential rain is uncommon. More intense rainfall is expected in Greece over the coming days, as well as in the Alps, Montenegro and southern Italy."

He thanked God for his freedom and for his loyal family, who never gave up hope, as he left the prison in Baton Rouge where he had been moved in preparation for his release. He also hugged his legal team at the Innocence Project New Orleans, the charity that had worked for more than a decade to get him out of jail. Earlier this week, State District Judge Richard Anderson said the case was ""weak at best"" and authorities withheld evidence that could have cleared him decades ago. On Tuesday, when the court heard he would be released, Mr Jones showed no reaction even though many of his relatives were reduced to tears as they hugged each other. His lawyer, Emily Maw, praised his ""extraordinary strength"" for spending ""over 16,000 days in prison for something he didn't do"". His niece Wajeedah Jones said she expected his first request on being released to be served his favourite food. ""We will have the gumbo ready for him when he gets out,"" she said. Black man in Louisiana who served 43 years in prison for a rape he didn't commit will be freed after he pays $2000 bail. https://t.co/Q4brFBUaaO pic.twitter.com/ulueGnh5Ty State prosecutors said they would not be seeking a retrial but would be asking for a review of the judge's decision to release Mr Jones. Ms Maw said it would be wrong for them to do so. He was arrested in early 1972 at the age of 19 on suspicion of abducting the nurse from Baton Rouge hospital car park and raping her at gunpoint behind a building on the night of 2 October, 1971. Mr Jones was convicted of aggravated rape at a 1974 retrial and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The case against Mr Jones relied ""entirely"" on evidence given by the nurse, who claimed he was the man who attacked her. The nurse, who died in 2008, picked out Mr Jones from a police line-up more than three months after the rape. But she also told officers the man who raped her was taller and had a ""much rougher"" voice than Mr Jones. He is now 65 years old and said to be a ""frail, ageing man"", who posed no danger to the community. The nurse's widower is said not to have opposed his release. Mr Jones' lawyers said the prosecutor who secured his conviction had a track record of withholding evidence that could assist defendants. An opinion by a state Supreme Court justice written in 1974 said the prosecutor was responsible for 11 reversed convictions in the preceding year - ""an incredible statistic for a single prosecutor,"" the judge noted."

He then handed the car over to Sotheby's auctioneers who will sell it and donate the proceeds to charities helping victims of human trafficking, vulnerable women and children on the African continent, and Christians suffering persecution in Iraq. A genuine Apostolic Blessing will likely increase its auction value, although it is unknown by how much. The 610 horsepower Huracan, which was painted white with gold stripes in keeping with Catholic Church traditions, has a top speed of 201mph and can go from 0-60mph in 3.2 seconds. But its speed was not enough to convince the Pontiff to abandon his Popemobile, a custom-designed car equipped with a 360-degree viewing box and a throne embroidered with the Pontiff's coat of arms. It isn't the first time the Pope has been gifted a luxury vehicle. The Pontiff received a Harley Davidson motorbike and jacket in 2014, but auctioned both for charity. Historically, the Pope travelled in a red silk-covered ""sedia gestatoria"", carried on shoulders, but the transportable throne was abandoned in favour of the Popemobile in the 20th century."

His wife found him collapsed on the floor outside the family home in Beatrice Close in Plaistow, Newham, in east London, and called 999 at 11.17pm. The 32-year-old businessman was left with life-changing injuries: he has trouble walking, suffers from epileptic fits, short-term memory loss and can't use his right hand properly. He is not expected to make a full recovery. Seventeen months on, a motive for the attack remains unclear. Detectives believe he was confronted by two men in hoodies who the CCTV footage shows were lying in wait for him in a car nearby. More than a dozen shots were fired from what police believe to be a semi-automatic weapon.

2017-11-15,Robert Mugabe's unchallenged rule over Zimbabwe has come to an end.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171116012842/https://news.sky.com/story/zimbabwe-no-way-back-for-weakened-robert-mugabe-11127355,"The military insist he is still in charge but his writ doesn't run beyond the walls of State House in Harare which is now surrounded by armoured vehicles under the command of former comrades. Just a few weeks short of his 30 year anniversary as the second president of Zimbabwe, the veteran of guerrilla war and detention in Rhodesian prisons is now a prisoner of the very men who helped liberate their country. They might have put up with the 93-year-old head of state had he not looked weaker by the day while his wife, Grace, manoeuvred herself into power and disenfranchised other veterans of the guerrilla camps in favour of her own cronies. Robert Mugabe In power since 1980, Mr Mugabe is the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence. Despite concerns over his health, Mr Mugabe, 93, says he intends to run again in elections next year. The world's oldest head of state sparked a political crisis on 6 November by sacking vice president and likely successor Emmerson Mnangagwa. Grace Mugabe  Zimbabwe's first lady married Robert Mugabe, 41 years her senior, in 1996. The 52-year-old has since become a very powerful figure and repeatedly asserted her credentials to succeed the president. Mrs Mugabe has repeatedly clashed with Emmerson Mnangagwa, who she is expected to succeed as vice president of the ruling ZANU-PF party. Emmerson Mnangagwa The 75-year-old former intelligence chief was sacked amid claims he plotted against the government and showed traits of ""disloyalty, disrespect and deceitfulness"". After his dismissal, Mr Mnangagwa fled to South Africa and called on ZANU-PF members to desert the President. Mr Mnangagwa, whose nickname is the Crocodile, told Mr Mugabe the party was ""not personal property for you and your wife to do as you please"". General Constantino Chiwenga The commander of Zimbabwe's defence forces is seen as an ally of Mr Mnangagwa and has demanded an end to a purge in the ZANU-PF party. Hours before sending troops into Harare, General Chiwenga warned the military ""will not hesitate to step in"" to prevent ""treacherous shenanigans"". He has been accused of treason by Mr Mugabe. Major General Sibusiso Moyo After troops seized control of the state broadcaster, Major General Sibusiso Moyo appeared on air to deny claims of a coup and assert the safety of Mr Mugabe and his family ""is guaranteed"". He added: ""We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country, in order to bring them to justice."" Morgan Tsvangirai Zimbabwe's opposition leader came close to unseating Mr Mugabe in March 2002 and March 2008, but lost both elections amid claims of vote-rigging and intimidation. In 2009, the long-time critic of Mr Mugabe survived a car crash which killed his wife - a collision his party suggested was ""not a genuine accident"". Commenting on news of Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal, Mr Tsvangirai claimed the president is ""determined to keep power by whatever means"". Major General SB Moyo insisted when announcing that there had not been a coup that Robert Mugabe was very much still the Zimbabwean president. But he is not. :: Mugabe: The war hero who became a dictator And he will not be able to recover from being so summarily and bloodlessly shoved aside. Even his notorious Sixth Brigade of North Korean trained presidential guards were unable, or unwilling, to protect him as the armoured vehicles rolled on to the streets of Harare the night before his home was surrounded. The armed forces said that they had intervened to end economic collapse and a purge of their fellow veterans from the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union from the civil service and elsewhere. Mr Mugabe will principally be remembered for instituting ever greater autocracy and for turning a breadbasket nation into a beggar through land reforms which drove white farmers off their land, replacing them with political supporters who mostly failed to work the land effectively. But among African leaders he has a different reputation. One that Westerners tend to ignore. He is seen as a liberation leader who served as prime minister and then president of a country that was hamstrung by economic ""reforms"" forced on it by western donors during the 1990s that simultaneously demanded democratisation. Once an Anglophile and an avid scholar of Shakespeare, Mr Mugabe turned against Britain, the former colonial power, and saw himself in the vanguard of the developing world's attempts to see off ""western neo-imperialist"" attempts to force unviable and unwelcome change. His supporters meanwhile ignored the mass killing of Ndebele in the south of the country while he consolidated power during the 1980s when an estimated 10,000 people perished. His defiance of western pressure meant that Zimbabwe was starved of donor support and his authoritarianism opened the doors to widespread corruption, often driven by the most senior elements in the armed forces. Illicit diamond mining, fuel smuggling and direct theft from the government's coffers became widespread in a country that had, and still often boasts, the highest literacy rate in Africa. Tendai Biti, the leading opposition intellectual, has called for the intervention of the African Union following the coup. The union has been intolerant of coups elsewhere in Africa and sent troops to put them down. It has been silent on events in Harare so far. Perhaps in recognition that a bloodless intervention may be the only way Zimbabwe can end Mr Mugabe's rule. But there is no clear route to what is coming next."

The paper also called Mr Trump a ""coward"" for cancelling a visit to the inter-Korean border. ""The worst crime for which he can never be pardoned is that he dared [to] malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership,"" the editorial said. ""He should know that he is just a hideous criminal sentenced to death by the Korean people."" Mr Trump refused to hold back on his usual criticism of Mr Kim during his 11-day trip to Asia. While in Hanoi, towards the end of his trip, he taunted the North Korean leader over his height and weight. He tweeted: ""Why would Kim Jong Un insult me by calling me 'old', when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat'?"" The Rodong editorial attacked Mr Trump's failure to tour the demilitarised zone (DMZ) dividing North and South Korea, which has become a traditional stop-off for senior US officials visiting the south. The US President's helicopter turned back after five minutes into the trip to the DMZ due to bad weather. ""It wasn't the weather. He was just too scared to face the glaring eyes of our troops,"" the editorial added. :: North Korea could hit London with nuclear missile in a year, retired general warns On the same day the editorial came out, Mr Kim resumed his public outings after a two-month hiatus during heightened tensions with the US and its allies. He visited a tractor factory which he boasted was made mainly with locally produced parts, in a bid to show sanctions could not hurt the country. China, North Korea's sole ally, has now announced it will send a special envoy to the hermit nation this week. President Xi Jinping's special envoy, Song Tao, will head to Pyongyang on Friday to discuss the Chinese Communist Party's congress, which took place last month. Mr Trump had urged Mr Xi to use China's influence over the North to rein Mr Kim in, warning that ""time is quickly running out"". On Sunday, Mr Trump said his Chinese counterpart stated ""he is upping the sanctions against"" North Korea, but China has not yet announced any new measures. The Chinese president has said he wants to resolve the nuclear crisis through diplomatic means over fears a regime collapse could trigger a rush of refugees across its border."
2017-11-15,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171116012842/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

They have joined forces with the Samaritans and the rail industry, including Network Rail, to launch Small Talk Saves Lives to give travellers the confidence to act if they notice vulnerable people on or around the rail network. By highlighting that suicidal thoughts can be temporary and often interrupted with a simple question, the campaign aims to give the public the tools to spot a potentially suicidal person help save a life. The campaign draws on insights from successful interventions made by some of the 16,000 rail staff and British Transport Police officers who have been trained by Samaritans in suicide prevention. Michael Budd, has worked on the railways for 20 years and has saved many lives on the tracks. He told Sky News: ""More and more we are dealing with mental health issues and people who are trying to take their own life. ""We probably get two or three a month, if not more in the Wessex area alone and I've personally intervened in the past year seven or eight times."" ""I would encourage anyone if they see somebody looking a little bit furtive, they've been there too long maybe, they're looking a bit dishevelled to approach them. ""The important thing is when you're actually speaking to somebody is not to ask leading questions, ask open questions. Don't say you know how they feel, because you can't possibly know how they feel. While there is no single sign or combination of behaviours that mean a person is suicidal, the advice to the public is that if something doesn't feel right - act. Warning signs to look out for include a person standing alone and isolated, looking distant or withdrawn, staying on the platform a long time without boarding a train or displaying something out of the ordinary in terms of behaviour or appearance. Different courses of action are suggested, depending on the situation and the response. They range from approaching the person and asking them a question to distract them from their thoughts, or alerting a member of rail staff or calling the police. The hope is that by appealing to members of the public, the number of life-saving interventions being made across Britain will increase further. Ian Stevens from Network Rail, who manages the suicide prevention programme on behalf of the rail industry, said: ""Given that nearly five million journeys are made by train every day, we are asking for passengers to work alongside our staff as the eyes and ears of the railway, helping us to keep everybody safe. ""If it were your loved one, a daughter or son, husband or wife who was going through an emotional crisis, wouldn't you hope that somebody took the time to stop and ask if they were OK? ""Even if in doubt, you can always report concerns to a member of staff or a police officer, but please act if your instinct is telling you that something is wrong."" :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK."

At least four of his victims contracted HIV, Sussex Police said. After a six-week trial, Rowe was found guilty of five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and five counts of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent. Jurors heard Rowe demanded unprotected sex with his victims and if they said no, he wore condoms which he had secretly broken in a bid to infect them. He would also send messages goading his victims, including one which read: ""I have HIV LOL. Oops!"" and another saying: ""I'm riddled."" During the trial, Rowe said he believed drinking his own urine daily and taking herbs and oils would cure him of HIV. He moved to Brighton shortly after being diagnosed in April 2015. Health workers became concerned when he stopped turning up to appointments and they contacted police when two men in the area contracted the virus. Rowe was arrested in February 2016 and initially lied to officers about his HIV status. He went on the run after being bailed in November last year, adopting the name Gary Cole, when he targeted more victims in the North East. When officers tracked him down to his final victim's house, police were handed his rucksack where a stash of ready-sabotaged condoms was found. Following the verdicts, Detective Inspector Andy Wolstenholme said he hoped the case would bring ""some closure to the victims"". It is the UK's first conviction for deliberately infecting others with HIV. Mr Wolstenholme said: ""Daryll Rowe was consistent in lying to his victims about having HIV, he was persistent and aggressive in wanting unprotected sex in order to infect people, and when he didn't get what he wanted, he deliberately damaged condoms to achieve his aim."" Judge Christine Henson QC said Rowe could face life imprisonment when he is sentenced on 29 January. After the trial, it also emerged two dock officers were sacked for falling asleep during the case. They were dismissed from court proceedings after being reported for snoring."
2017-11-15,Parliament's close procedural combat over Brexit has begun in earnest. All-night sittings and all-out battles between and within parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171116012842/https://news.sky.com/story/twin-tightropes-for-theresa-may-amid-mps-close-brexit-combat-11126950,"It began surreally enough, with Labour's backbench Brexiteer Frank Field arguing about the precise hour of Brexit. His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."

His most recent post on his Twitter page on 11 October read: ""Marching off to Heathrow. I may be some time (don't try to rescue me, please - where I'm going in PNG you won't ever find me you know...)"" The father of three has no phone or GPS service but was expected back in Papua New Guinea's capital Port Moresby on Sunday for a flight to Hong Kong, where he was due to give a speech to the Royal Geographic Society. His sister, Katy Pestille, told Sky News that it was the second time he had gone missing. She recalled: ""When he was younger he went from the mouth of the Amazon to the mouth of the Orinoco, through all this uncharted terrain. He was the first person to do that. It's a long, long way and he was absent for six months and missing for three, so we've been through all this before. ""Not knowing where he was for three months was really, really awful. This was when he was about 22. Our parents were alive then and it was agony at the time. ""We are just sitting and waiting and just hoping that he'll just walk out of a bush, which is what happened last time."" Mrs Pestille said that she was not worried about the tribe, as her brother had visited them some 30 years ago and wanted to ""reconnect with them"", with nobody else having visited the Yaifo since then. She added: ""Usually he gets on very well with the tribes. It's the other people hiding in the jungle - drug dealers, illegal loggers and people that don't want to be found - who are more dangerous."" On his website, Mr Allen, who is based in Bristol with his family, describes the Yaifo as ""the remotest people in Papa New Guinea"" and ""one of the last people on the entire planet who are out-of-contact with our interconnected world"". He also said the terrain he must traverse to reach them was ""treacherous"". He wrote: ""Either I must paddle down river for a week or so - or enlist the help of the Yaifo, as I did last time; together we managed to achieve the only recorded crossing of the Central Range. So, if this website or my Twitter account falls more than usually silent - I'm due back mid Nov - it's because I am still out there somewhere. ""So, don't bother to call or text! Just like the good old days, I won't be taking a sat phone, GPS or companion. Or anything else much. Because this is how I do my journeys of exploration."" Marching off to Heathrow.

""He would never miss something like the Hong Kong talk unless something had happened. ""He is a highly experienced explorer, very clever and resourceful and adept at surviving in the most hostile places on Earth, and he would never give up. ""He may not be a young man any more but he is very fit."" Ms Sarsby described the Yaifo as ""possibly headhunters, quite a scary bunch"". She added: ""I just imagine he might have been taken ill or is lying injured somewhere, perhaps with a broken leg, and maybe being helped by locals. He never takes a phone with him - he believes in living like the locals."" Mr Allen has previously completed the first documented journey the length of the Namib Desert and is the only person known to have crossed the full width of the 1,000-mile Gobi Desert alone with camels."

He described a meeting between the pair on Wednesday morning as ""positive"" and ""constructive"". He said: ""We talked about his trip to Iran, and as of the meeting, it's not confirmed when. ""He said he was keen to take me but it is a question to resolve both within the advice of the Foreign Office and also in liaising with the Iranians. ""We will still keep pushing for that. ""It's very important for me to go on that trip, to be standing alongside the Foreign Secretary, and I understand that's a big ask, it's reasonably unprecedented, but it's important for me."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian charity worker, was detained in Tehran Airport in April 2016 as she was returning home from a family holiday with 22-month-old daughter Gabriella. The 38-year-old denies spying charges. She has been in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison since then and her husband has accused Mr Johnson of possibly increasing her sentence by five years after he told MPs last week she was ""teaching people journalism"" in the country. Mr Ratcliffe said he and the Foreign Secretary spoke about diplomatic protection for his wife. ""We talked of the point of diplomatically protection, which is different to diplomatic immunity,"" he said. ""It is, in essence, when a state like Britain decides Nazanin is being treated badly [and that] because she's British she's entitled to protection by the British state. ""It's not unprecedented but it's a big step. I said it would be important and helpful. ""The Foreign Office expressed reservations and we agreed there are some questions we've sent from the lawyers, they've agreed to answer the questions and then for the lawyers to sit down and talk it through both legally and practically."" :: Johnson to 'leave no stone unturned' for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe A Foreign Office spokesman said the meeting was ""positive"". He added the British ambassador in Iran had ""once again"" raised Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case with the Iranian foreign minister and had urged they ""provide consular access, appropriate medical treatment, a decision on Richard Ratcliffe's visa application and access for Richard Ratcliffe to see his wife if a visit does go ahead"". ""The Foreign Secretary and officials outlined that the key question is whether diplomatic protection will have a positive impact on the case, given all the representations that have already been made,"" he added. ""They agreed that lawyers should meet in the coming fortnight to discuss it further."" On Mr Ratcliffe's request to accompany Mr Johnson to Iran before the end of the year, the spokesman said: ""Our overriding principle in handling this case is to secure a permanent family reunion, not a temporary one. ""Any decision must be guided by that principle."" Mr Ratcliffe has not seen his young daughter, who has been staying with Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family, for 19 months. She can no longer speak English, which makes it difficult for them to converse. He has been trying to get a visa to visit Iran for the past 19 months without success."
2017-11-15,"No ""causal association"" can be found between a pregnancy test and malformations to babies in the womb, according to a government working group study. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171116012842/https://news.sky.com/story/primodos-did-not-cause-deformities-study-11127471,"This conclusion was reached despite the fact that both human and newly revealed animal studies pointing towards a link were examined. Research has indicated that a number of women given the drug, which contained super-strength hormones, in the 1960s and 70s suffered instant miscarriages, and that thousands more gave birth to babies with serious deformities. The Government's expert working group (EWG), which carried out the study, said the failure to find a definite connection is partly due to outdated methods used by scientists in the 1970s. Alleged victims of the drug, called Primodos, have already criticised the terms of reference of the report and the way it has been conducted. :: Primodos: Sky News exposes pregnancy drug cover-up They say the MHRA-led report was not set up to look for a ""causal association"" but only a ""possible association"", which they argue requires a lower level of proof. One 1979 study examined by the EWG - released by the pharmaceutical manufacturer Schering, now owned by Bayer - found mice were deformed by compounds within the drug. It reported ""visceral malformations, including the heart, lung and thorax wall"" and said ""the increase in these malformations in this study should be considered drug related"". Another test on rabbits indicated skeletal problems and ""wavy ribs"" caused by the drug. A number of studies into rats even found embryos were killed by high doses of the drug. But the EWG concluded that the animal studies provided ""insufficient evidence"" for a connection between Primodos and deformity. The group also examined human studies. The majority favoured an association but the group believes the evidence is not strong enough. There is frustration that the study, overseen by current medicines regulator the MHRA, has not investigated regulatory failings. Sky News understands that the EWG was told to disregard evidence relating to regulation of the drug. There is also frustration that the campaign group's only representative on the panel has had to sign a confidentiality agreement and cannot discuss what was said in meetings. Marie Lyon, chair of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests, told Sky News: ""I could go to prison if I divulge what was discussed. So it isn't transparent. I can't speak to our members. I can't speak to any members of parliament, I can't disclose anything to the 118 MPs who are supporting this campaign. ""It defies logic that this kind of control is placed on someone who is just trying to get justice."" The publication comes several months after Sky News revealed that in 1975 the UK regulator knew of a potential five-to-one risk that the drug could cause deformities, but only warned the manufacturer, not the general public. Documents relating to this risk were later destroyed, according to the files we uncovered from archives in Berlin. SNP MP Hannah Bardell, who has a constituent allegedly affected, said: ""The Sky documentary Primodos: The Secret Drug Scandal raises concerns that documents linking Primodos to deformed babies and premature deaths were destroyed."" Bayer denies a causal link between Primodos and birth defects and says that after a full review the evidence that it caused malformations was ""extremely weak"". A statement following the EWG verdict said: ""Bayer notes that a review by an independent Expert Working Group on hormone pregnancy tests of the Commission on Human Medicines has found, consistent with Bayer's view, based on all available data, that the scientific evidence does not support a causal association between the use of hormone pregnancy tests, such as Primodos, and birth defects or miscarriage."""
2017-11-15,The Government is to cut the controversial six-week wait for Universal Credit payments in the comings days in a bid to see off a Conservative rebellion.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171116012842/https://news.sky.com/story/government-backs-down-on-universal-credit-wait-11127313,"A Government source familiar with the plans told Sky News there would be ""some movement [on the wait time] in the early part of next week"" after intensive behind-the-scenes discussions with a group of up to two dozen rebel MPs. The source said ministers were working on plans to cut the wait to five weeks or less in a significant concession to backbench MPs. And Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke is also said to be looking to do more on advance payments for claimants as the roll-out of Universal Credit is expanded from five to 50 job centres a month. Universal Credit combines six benefits into one single benefit and is designed to simplify the welfare system and to ""make work pay"". It was the flagship welfare reform of David Cameron's coalition government, but has been plagued with delays since its inception and by criticism over its design. One flaw is the six-week wait time which has been criticised across the political divide amid concerns it is pushing claimants into arrears on rent and council tax, and forcing some to use food banks. :: Charity warns Universal Credit rollout could see food banks struggle this winter A quarter of all claimants are having to wait more than six weeks to receive their payments. The system is designed to mirror the way wages are paid, but a new Sky Data poll found more than three in four respondents thought the six-week wait was too long, with only 8% saying it was about right. The expected reduction in the wait time will be the second major concession within weeks. Last month Mr Gauke announced those calling the Universal Credit helpline would no longer be charged up to 55p a minute. The expected reduction in the wait time comes after a sustained campaign by prominent backbenchers Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston, Johnny Mercer and Stephen McPartland. Three of the rebels had a private meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May last month to outline their concerns. Since then Mr Gauke and Damian Hinds, the ministers responsible for the policy, have been in ""constant contact"" with MPs as they work up a plan to tweak the system, according to one person familiar with the discussions. :: Six-week wait for Universal Credit shake-up will cause 'Christmas disaster' Under the proposed changes, ministers could scrap the seven-day waiting time before a new claim can be lodged and shorten the processing time at the end of a four-week assessment to ensure recipients have to wait for a month rather than six weeks to receive their benefit. Mr Gauke may also do more to ensure claimants are offered advance payments in order to tide them over as they wait to be paid. Ms Allen has secured a backbench debate in the House of Commons on Universal Credit on Thursday. She told Sky News: ""We know the Government has listened fully to our concerns, so many of us are hopeful we will hear positive news soon. ""Ahead of the Budget next week, we will be having a backbench debate on this issue. Perhaps there will be an opportunity for an update there."" Mr Mercer said he was ""confident"" that the wait time would be reduced, while Mr McPartland went further by saying he ""believes it will be reduced from six to four weeks"". ""We're keen to see that happen,"" he said. Mrs May was challenged over the roll-out of Universal Credit at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warning thousands of families are being put through the ""trauma"" of fearing eviction over Christmas due to the benefit changes."

The UKAD has been unable to prove what was in the package, commonly known as a Jiffy bag, which was delivered at the end of the Criterium du Dauphine race in France six years ago. It had been suggested that it may have contained the drug Fluimucil, which can help break up thick mucus in the lungs and make it easier to breathe. The organisation has confirmed that no charges will be brought, ""despite very significant effort on UKAD's part to confirm or refute the account that the package delivered to Team Sky contained Fluimucil"". Wiggins, who in 2012 became the first British rider to win the Tour de France, said: ""I welcome UKAD's confirmation that no anti-doping charges are to be brought. It has always been the case that no such charges could be brought against me as no anti-doping violations took place. ""I am pleased that this has finally been confirmed publicly but there are a large number of questions regarding the investigation which I feel remain unanswered. ""Being accused of any doping indiscretion is the worst possible thing for any professional sportsperson, especially when it is without any solid factual basis and you know the allegation will be categorically untrue."" The 37-year-old, who retired after the 2016 OIympics in Rio, said that he had been ""hounded"" on his doorstep since the investigation began and that his family had been subjected to a period of ""innuendo and speculation"" that had caused ""serious personal damage"". He has also questioned UKAD over the source of the original allegation, why it was considered credible, how much the investigation had cost and why it had taken so long. UKAD Chief Executive Nicole Sapstead said: ""As with all UKAD investigations, our work has been thorough and extensive, and I can reassure the public that we treat every credible allegation with the utmost seriousness."" She said the investigation had been hampered by ""a lack of accurate medical records"" at British Cycling, which she described as ""a serious concern"". UKAD has written to British Cycling, UK Sport, Sport England and Team Sky, and referred some information to the General Medical Council, following the outcome of the investigation."
2017-11-15,"It's difficult to get a precise handle on the size of Zimbabwe's economy, for two reasons.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171116012842/https://news.sky.com/story/how-zimbabwes-economy-has-collapsed-under-mugabe-11127628,"The first is the paucity of information available in a dictatorship and the likelihood that what information is made available by the authorities may be doctored. The second is that the collapse of the economy in recent years means a lot of economic activity is 'informal'. In other words, conducted in cash or by barter and therefore not easily measured. A very large number of transactions are hidden from officials. :: LIVE: Mugabe wife flees Zimbabwe - Sky sources This second point is crucial because researchers seeking to establish the facts have argued, during recent years, that the 'shadow' or 'informal' economy has been growing in Zimbabwe in recent years more strongly than the official economy. This is a problem that economists have everywhere. Even in OECD economies, the amount of activity taking place in the shadow economy can be as much as 11% of GDP, rising to 20% in Italy. In Zimbabwe, according to the latest research, the shadow economy is equivalent to around 33% of GDP. What is clear is that Zimbabwe's economy has collapsed under Robert Mugabe. Food production halved in the 1990s as a result of his decision to strip white farmers of their land and hand it to members of the black population who, in many cases, had no farming experience. The country's involvement in a war in the Congo piled up debts while high interest rates strangled economic growth. Things got worse when, between 1999 and 2001, Mr Mugabe stepped up pressure on white farmers and encouraged more forcible land seizures. Many governments suspended aid payments to Zimbabwe as a result of this and Mr Mugabe's brutal suppression of the opposition. Hyperinflation followed. From a rate of 59% in 2000, inflation was running at almost 600% by 2003 and, in 2006, it hit the scarcely-believable rate of 1,200%. The following year it hit a rate of 66,200% and, by the end of 2008, it had hit nearly 80,000,000,000% (80 billion). The government's response, in 2007, was to declare inflation illegal. :: No way back for Robert Mugabe Business people and entrepreneurs caught raising prices were arrested, further hollowing-out the economy's ability to grow, while the government imposed a wages freeze. The upshot of all this was that, according to the World Bank, Zimbabwe's total GDP shrank from $8.6bn in 1991 to $4.4bn in 2008. Gross national income per capita, meanwhile, collapsed from $1,100 in 1981, the first year after independence, to a miserable $300 in 1998. In 2009, the government threw in the towel, agreeing that using other currencies - notably the US dollar but also the South African rand and the euro - was no longer illegal. However, as public sector workers were still being paid in devalued Zimbabwean dollars, this was of little comfort to them. But it did spark a recovery of sorts. In 2009, prices in the shops fell for the first time in five years and, later that year, in response to Mugabe's agreement to share power with the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, the International Monetary Fund agreed a $400m support package. Zimbabwean GDP rallied to $8.4bn in 2009 and has risen every year since, according to the World Bank, hitting $16.3bn last year. It was predicted to grow by 2.8% this year, according to the IMF, although the Mugabe regime itself was forecasting 3.7% growth. Yet growth has stalled in recent years. The economy grew by just 1.1% in 2015 and by just 0.5% last year. And what of the make-up of the economy? Like many countries in Africa, Zimbabwe is heavily dependent on exports of resources, with tobacco, gold and platinum being the main export earners. Famously, it was once known as 'the bread-basket of Africa' for its prodigious wheat and maize exports, although these have collapsed following the farm seizures and a lack of cash. Wheat production in 1990, before the farm seizures began in earnest, was 325,000 tonnes. Last year, it was just 20,000 tonnes. Keeping the show on the road in recent years has been China, which now accounts for more than half of all foreign direct investment into the country, as well as providing a physical supply of hard currency like the US dollar. In particular, Chinese money has helped revive exports of tobacco, which alone accounts for a third of export earnings, while China has also patched up the country's energy infrastructure and is building its first solar power plants. The Chinese have also built a $200m shopping mall in the west of Harare, the capital, where there is an abundance of Chinese restaurants. :: Mugabe: The war hero who became a dictator Other countries, though, have been reluctant to invest in Zimbabwe due to the endemic corruption and excessive interference by the government in the economy. While agriculture remains the backbone of Zimbabwe's economy, the country also has other resources, including vast reserves of coal. Its diamond reserves are the world's second largest, after Russia, while it also boasts Africa's second largest reserves of platinum. So this is a fertile country whose resources are the envy of many others in Africa. And it has one further resource - its people. Millions of Zimbabweans, many of them skilled, have fled for South Africa and elsewhere in recent years and their remittances home have played an important role in staving off a complete collapse of the economy. If Mugabe is finally removed and democracy restored, many of them might return home, boosting economic growth in the process."

The Daily Telegraph's front page followed the return of the EU Withdrawal Bill to the House of Commons on Wednesday, in which Remain-supporting Conservative MPs voiced their anger at a proposed Government amendment to write an exit date of 11pm on 29 March, 2019 into the legislation. It has raised the possibility of the Government having to withdraw the amendment in order to avoid a humiliating defeat, as a number of Tory MPs signalled they would vote against it.

Earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions, fellow Conservative backbencher Michael Tomlinson appeared to allude to the Daily Telegraph front page when he asked Theresa May whether she would agree it is the ""duty"" of MPs to ""scrutinise"" and ""debate"" the EU Withdrawal Bill. The Prime Minister replied: ""There is of course a lively debate going on in this place - that is right and proper, and that is important - and strong views are held on different sides of the argument about the EU on both sides of this House. ""What we are doing as a Government is listening to the contributions that are being made and listening carefully to those who wish to improve the bill, and I hope that we can all come together to deliver on the decision that the country took that we should leave the EU."" Remain-supporting Tories have also signalled they could support a number of their own amendments to the Government legislation, which is being debated and voted on at committee stage over the next few weeks. A total of 464 amendments have been tabled to the bill."

Chancellor Philip Hammond is facing growing pressure from some on the Conservative backbenches and from within Cabinet to make a radical offer on housing in his Budget next week. But in an interview he warned solving the crisis would not be straightforward. ""There is no silver bullet, there isn't a single thing that solves the challenge of affordability in the housing market - we are a crowded island and this is a very complex challenge,"" Mr Hammond said. However, he went on to hint that there may be some offer to assist first-time buyers. ""Next week we will start to set out our plan for addressing the housing challenges in this country, making sure that the next generation has the same opportunities as their parents did for home ownership and the accumulation of personal wealth through assets,"" said the Chancellor. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, who has suggested the Chancellor should consider borrowing more money to invest in new house-building, will deliver a speech on housing in Bristol later. He is expected to say: ""Without affordable, secure, safe housing we risk creating a rootless generation, drifting from one short-term tenancy to the next, never staying long enough to play a role in their community."" Mr Javid is also expected to announce debts held by housing associations will be taken off the public balance sheet to ""ensure housing associations have a stable investment environment to build more homes"". The move follows a provisional decision by the Office for National Statistics to reclassify housing associations as private, not-for-profit landlords, subject to the Government changing regulations that were seen to constitute public sector control. The Government has been determined to reverse an ONS decision in 2015 to classify housing associations as public bodies, which added tens of billions of pounds to the public balance sheet. But Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said the Government's pronouncements would do little to reassure voters. ""If the Prime Minister wants to help families on ordinary incomes, she should back Labour's plan to build 100,000 new genuinely affordable homes a year, help first-time buyers and give renters new consumer rights including control on rents,"" he said."

He tweeted: ""Please boycott @GreggsOfficial to protest against its sick anti-Christian Advent Calendar.

2017-11-15,Plans for a Â£250m lorry park off the M20 - pitched by the Government as an alternative to Operation Stack - have been dropped.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171116012842/https://news.sky.com/story/government-scraps-163250m-alternative-to-operation-stack-11127783,"Former Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the proposal for Stamford West, Kent, during 2015's Autumn Statement after huge disruption that summer due to industrial action by French ferry workers and migrant activity in Calais, which caused delays at the Port of Dover. It meant that Operation Stack - a police initiative which essentially creates 3,000 parking spaces for trucks on the motorway - was deployed for more than a month. But the lorry park proposal was not without controversy, having proved unpopular with nearby residents, and in October last year was subjected to a judicial review. Now the Department for Transport (DfT) has told the High Court that it will no longer be defending the plan, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has confirmed that the Government will go back to the drawing board for an alternative solution. He said: ""My department and Highways England have, since being judicially reviewed, tried to find a solution so that the lorry park could be delivered as quickly as possible to mitigate the impacts of Operation Stack, whilst also meeting our environmental obligations. However, it has not proven possible to do so. ""But I can announce today that we are immediately starting the process to promote a lorry park through the normal planning process, including a full environmental impact assessment, as a potential permanent solution to Operation Stack."" Mr Grayling added that the ""scope, scale and location"" of the potential solutions will have to be reassessed, with the Prime Minister having triggered Article 50 since the original lorry park was put forward. Last month Mr Grayling suggested the M20 could become a semi-permanent lorry park if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal. Highways England will run a public consultation on an alternative early next year with a view to submitting a planning application in 2019, and an interim solution by March of that year. In the meantime, Manston Airfield will continue to be usable for lorry drivers during severe cross-Channel disruption. Roads Minister Jesse Norman added: ""We know how seriously the lives of Kent residents and the prospects of businesses were affected when Operation Stack was implemented in 2015 and we remain fully committed to a permanent solution."""

There was no hint of a row when Mr Conze left the company last month after six years in the role. Though a source has since told Sky News he was sacked. At the time, Dyson had reported only that he was being replaced by chief operating officer Jim Rowan to lead its drive to create the company's own electric car. Sir James was also quoted then as saying he ""would like to thank Max Conze for his great contribution to Dyson"". But the company said on Wednesday: ""The Dyson Board has decided to bring a claim against Max Conze at the High Court of Justice in London in relation to his actions while chief executive including the disclosure of confidentialinformation, and a breach of his fiduciary duties."" :: Dyson seeks 'clean break' from EU He has denied Dyson's claims and suggested the firm was trying to distract attention away from allegations he was about to issue against the company.

""The Prime Minister sent Russia a clear message on Monday night - we know what you are doing, and you will not succeed,"" Mr Martin said at a meeting held in London on Wednesday. Theresa May accused Russia of ""seeking to weaponise information"" as she accused Moscow of meddling in elections and hacking Denmark's defence ministry and the German parliament. She also accused Moscow of ""deploying its state-run media organisations to plant fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to sow discord in the West and undermine our institutions"". NCSC was set up a year ago as the public-facing and defence-focused side of the UK's signals intelligence agency GCHQ. In that time it has responded to more than 600 significant incidents, some of which related to hostile states, and others from what Mr Martin called ""rampant criminality in cyberspace"". The NCSC chief said there were basic things that could be done to protect against both threats, although he said nation-state attacks could be very sophisticated. Mr Martin said he couldn't ""get into too much of the details of intelligence matters, but I can confirm that Russian interference... has included attacks on the UK media, telecommunications and energy sectors. ""That is clearly a cause for concern - Russia is seeking to undermine the international system. That much is clear. The PM made the point on Monday night - that international order as we know it is in danger of being eroded."" Russia has denied claims of meddling in elections, including last year's US presidential vote."

As children ran away screaming Mrs Maguire, who was bleeding heavily, ran to an office, Wakefield Coroner's Court heard. Cornick followed behind, and the court heard that he smiled at the police officer who arrested him as Mrs Maguire lay dying on a stretcher. A paramedic told the hearing that the teacher had suffered the worst stabbing injuries he had ever witnessed, including one wound that went completely through her body from back to front. Mrs Maguire's husband, Don Maguire, closed his eyes and held a hand to his face and two of her sisters kept their heads bowed as details of the attack were recalled. Coroner Kevin McLoughlin read a series of witness statements, including that of Susan Francis, head of modern languages at the school. Ms Francis said she was in a staff office when she suddenly heard ""all this screaming"" and children ""running down the corridor, screaming looking horrified"". Mrs Maguire then appeared holding the back of her neck, saying: ""He's stabbed me in the neck."" Her statement continued: ""She came running into the office, then the lad followed her. Then I shut the office door and put my foot against it. It was literally a split second. ""He just stood looking at me. No emotion. I just remember his face having no emotion. Like a mask on his face. ""I could see cuts on her jumper and lots of bleeding coming out of her neck. ""She said, 'I can't breathe. I'm dying.' I just kept stroking her and kissing her. She knew she was dying. ""Her colour was going. The ambulance people arrived, their faces looked like they had walked into some kind of Armageddon."" Paramedic Carl Sagar was first on the scene and took Mrs Maguire to hospital. ""In all my career the stab wounds inflicted on Ann were the worst I have ever seen,"" he said in his statement. Police officer Katie Myles was called to the school and recalled having a bizarre exchange with Cornick as she arrested him. He first asked her for ice for his hand which he had hurt, the court heard. Her statement continued: ""Cornick then asked me, 'What is your favourite movie?' ""Cornick then asked, 'What is your favourite adrenaline sport? I love adrenaline sport'. Cornick then smiled showing no remorse for what he had done."" Medics at Leeds General Infirmary tried to resuscitate Mrs Maguire for 40 minutes before, in the presence of her husband, a decision was made to stop. A pathologist report said there were no defence injuries and Mrs Maguire had been stabbed seven times in the back after being ""taken by surprise"", with the fatal wound being ""stab wound three"" to her jugular. The inquest heard that the ""intelligent"" but ""weird"" Cornick had clashed with Mrs Maguire after she refused to let him drop Spanish. In November 2014 he was jailed for life for murder and ordered to spend at least 20 years in custody."

It added: ""We sincerely apologise for the offence that has been caused, particularly to those members of our wider community to whom such inappropriate and unacceptable commentary was the focus.""

2017-11-16,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171117014402/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

It comes following an investigation into Spacey's conduct while he was artistic director at the venue between 2004 and 2015. The investigation resulted in ""20 personal testimonies shared of alleged inappropriate behaviour"" in relation to the Old Vic, the theatre said. Only one of the claims was reported, it said, but staff were ""unclear about how to respond"". ""During his tenure, the Old Vic was in a unique position of having a Hollywood star at the helm around whom existed a cult of personality,"" the statement said. ""The investigation found that his stardom and status at The Old Vic may have prevented people, and in particular junior staff or young actors, from feeling that they could speak up or raise a hand for help. ""The Old Vic is deeply dismayed by the allegations and thankful to all those who have contacted its helpline directly. Without them it would not have been possible to conduct such a thorough review."" The first allegation against Spacey was made by actor Anthony Rapp, who accused him of sexual assault. Spacey said he did ""not remember the encounter"" but offered ""the sincerest apology"" if it had taken place. He has not been charged with any crime. The Old Vic said that, in relation to its investigation, ""no correspondents alleged they were minors at the time that their complaint arose"". :: Is Kevin Spacey using his sexuality as a PR spin? Old Vic chairman Nick Clarry said: ""To all those people who felt unable to speak up at the time, the Old Vic truly apologises. ""Inappropriate behaviour by anyone working at The Old Vic is completely unacceptable. ""We will foster a safe and supportive environment without prejudice, harassment or bullying of any sort, at any level. We want anyone who works here to feel confident, valued and proud to be part of the Old Vic family."" The current artistic director of the company, Matthew Warchus, expressed ""genuine and deep sympathy for all those who have come forward"". ""These allegations have been a shock and a disturbing surprise to many of us,"" he said. The Old Vic's statement comes after Netflix and Sony Pictures cut ties with Spacey, cancelling his show House Of Cards and replacing him in an upcoming film."

Her body was discovered hidden under the floor of the couple's home with several gunshot wounds, while two of Neal's neighbours were among those killed. Neal, reportedly in his early 40s, had been banned from having guns in February after he was charged with stabbing a neighbour and was on bail. Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said he believed the gunman's motive was ""getting even with his neighbours and when it went that far he just went on a rampage"". The 25-minute killing spree ended when a police car rammed the stolen vehicle Neal was driving and shot him dead. The gunman had earlier opened fire at Rancho Tehama Elementary School, injuring one pupil. He tried to enter the school but staff members managed to lock the outside doors and barricaded themselves inside when they heard gunshots, officials said. Mr Johnston said officers had recovered two illegally made semi-automatic rifles and two handguns, which were registered in someone else's name. Neighbours had complained about Neal firing hundreds of rounds from his house and officers had visited his home several times, the assistant sheriff added. Mr Johnston told reporters: ""We can't anticipate what people are going to do. We don't have a crystal ball."" The gunman's sister, Sheridan Orr, said her brother had struggled with mental illness throughout his life and had a violent temper. His mother, who gave her name only as Anne, said her son had been in a long-running dispute with neighbours who he believed were cooking the drug methamphetamine. She said her son - a marijuana grower - told her: ""It's all over now"" and ""I have done everything I could do and I am fighting against everyone who lives in this area"". She said Neal apologised to her during their brief conversation, saying he was ""on a cliff"" and the people around him were trying to ""execute"" him."

The allegation follows interviews with 52 Rohingya women and girls from 19 villages who have fled to Bangladesh. Twenty-nine of them said they had been raped, and all but one of the sex attacks were gang rapes. :: Explained: The Rohingya Refugee Crisis Hala Sadak, a 15-year-old from Hathi Para village in Maungdaw Township, described being stripped naked by 10 soldiers who went on to rape her. ""When my brother and sister came to get me, I was lying there on the ground, they thought I was dead,"" she told the rights group. In eight cases, women and girls reported being raped by five or more soldiers. Many survivors said they endured days of agony walking with swollen and torn genitals to reach Bangladesh. ""Rape has been a prominent and devastating feature of the Burmese military's campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya,"" said Skye Wheeler, author of the report. :: Why is the Rohingya crisis not classed as genocide? She said the ""barbaric acts of violence have left countless women and girls brutally harmed and traumatised"". The report by the New York-based rights group comes just days after Pramila Patten, the UN special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, said sexual violence was ""being commanded, orchestrated and perpetrated by the Armed Forces of Myanmar"". It urged the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar and targeted sanctions against military leaders responsible for human rights violations, including sexual violence. The latest testimonials by survivors adds to the growing evidence of what has been described as an alarming humanitarian crisis. This month a Sky News team filmed the first independent evidence of the shocking deprivation and desperation among thousands of stranded Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State, including emaciated women and newborn babies who had been dumped on beaches and left to die. Our crew also spoke to a man recruiting vulnerable Rohingya women and children in Bangladeshi camps, who had fled persecution at the hands of the Burmese army, for the country's notorious sex trade. He said this latest exodus had been ""good for business"". More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have been forced to flee from their homes in the mainly Buddhist country amid the military crackdown. The government insists the crackdown is aimed at rooting out Rohingya ""terrorists"" behind an attack on 30 police posts in late August which left 12 members of the security forces dead. The UN has described the latest mass exodus of the Rohingya as ""the world's fastest growing refugee crisis"" and ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has faced international criticism for failing to directly condemn the violence by the country's security forces. However, there has been little intervention by the international community to halt it."

Black man in Louisiana who served 43 years in prison for a rape he didn't commit will be freed after he pays $2000 bail. https://t.co/Q4brFBUaaO pic.twitter.com/ulueGnh5Ty State prosecutors said they would not be seeking a retrial but would be asking for a review of the judge's decision to release Mr Jones. Ms Maw said it would be wrong for them to do so. He was arrested in early 1972 at the age of 19 on suspicion of abducting the nurse from Baton Rouge hospital car park and raping her at gunpoint behind a building on the night of 2 October, 1971. Mr Jones was convicted of aggravated rape at a 1974 retrial and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The case against Mr Jones relied ""entirely"" on evidence given by the nurse, who claimed he was the man who attacked her. The nurse, who died in 2008, picked out Mr Jones from a police line-up more than three months after the rape. But she also told officers the man who raped her was taller and had a ""much rougher"" voice than Mr Jones. He is now 65 years old and said to be a ""frail, ageing man"", who posed no danger to the community. The nurse's widower is said not to have opposed his release. Mr Jones' lawyers said the prosecutor who secured his conviction had a track record of withholding evidence that could assist defendants. An opinion by a state Supreme Court justice written in 1974 said the prosecutor was responsible for 11 reversed convictions in the preceding year - ""an incredible statistic for a single prosecutor,"" the judge noted."
2017-11-16,Zimbabwe's defeated ex-prime minister has returned to the country as politicians eye opportunities for power while President Robert Mugabe is under house arrest.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171117014402/https://news.sky.com/story/ex-pm-morgan-tsvangirai-returns-to-zimbabwe-amid-military-coup-11128231,"Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader who was made Mr Mugabe's deputy between 2009 and 2013 after he saw a surge in support in elections, was on the same plane into Harare as Sky News. Sky correspondent David Bowden reported that also on the plane were two other government ministers, who were returning to their country from Russia. It came after the army seized power in the country in what the leader of the African Union said looked like a ""coup"". Mr Mugabe is being detained in the presidential palace, where explosions and gunshots were heard early on Wednesday. The army said it was holding the president and his wife Grace, but there have also been rumours she had fled to Namibia. Bowden said: ""People are gathering here to see how this plays out and what they can grab from the spoils."" :: The war hero who became a dictator:: No way back for Robert Mugabe He added: ""As we left the airport there were heavily armed soldiers on checkpoints, checking every vehicle in, and every vehicle out. ""As we moved through the streets driven by a local activist we came upon an armoured personnel carrier full of soldiers who quickly raced out and chased us round the corner as soon as they realised we were filming them. ""We were convinced they might open fire - but they didn't. It gives you an idea of the tension on the streets hereâ¦ but it's a tension laced with expectation. Robert Mugabe In power since 1980, Mr Mugabe is the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence. Despite concerns over his health, Mr Mugabe, 93, says he intends to run again in elections next year. The world's oldest head of state sparked a political crisis on 6 November by sacking vice president and likely successor Emmerson Mnangagwa. Grace Mugabe  Zimbabwe's first lady married Robert Mugabe, 41 years her senior, in 1996. The 52-year-old has since become a very powerful figure and repeatedly asserted her credentials to succeed the president. Mrs Mugabe has repeatedly clashed with Emmerson Mnangagwa, who she is expected to succeed as vice president of the ruling ZANU-PF party. Emmerson Mnangagwa The 75-year-old former intelligence chief was sacked amid claims he plotted against the government and showed traits of ""disloyalty, disrespect and deceitfulness"". After his dismissal, Mr Mnangagwa fled to South Africa and called on ZANU-PF members to desert the President. Mr Mnangagwa, whose nickname is the Crocodile, told Mr Mugabe the party was ""not personal property for you and your wife to do as you please"". General Constantino Chiwenga The commander of Zimbabwe's defence forces is seen as an ally of Mr Mnangagwa and has demanded an end to a purge in the ZANU-PF party. Hours before sending troops into Harare, General Chiwenga warned the military ""will not hesitate to step in"" to prevent ""treacherous shenanigans"". He has been accused of treason by Mr Mugabe. Major General Sibusiso Moyo After troops seized control of the state broadcaster, Major General Sibusiso Moyo appeared on air to deny claims of a coup and assert the safety of Mr Mugabe and his family ""is guaranteed"". He added: ""We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country, in order to bring them to justice."" Morgan Tsvangirai Zimbabwe's opposition leader came close to unseating Mr Mugabe in March 2002 and March 2008, but lost both elections amid claims of vote-rigging and intimidation. In 2009, the long-time critic of Mr Mugabe survived a car crash which killed his wife - a collision his party suggested was ""not a genuine accident"". Commenting on news of Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal, Mr Tsvangirai claimed the president is ""determined to keep power by whatever means"". ""People seem to think that something concrete is going to happen. They don't know what it is but they do know that once it plays out Zimbabwe will not be the same as it has been for the last 37 years."" Earlier, African Union leader Alpha Conde, said: ""The African Union expresses its serious concern regarding the situation unfolding in Zimbabwe."" He went on to insist that ""constitutional order... be restored immediately"" and called ""on all stakeholders to show responsibility and restraint"". United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed for calm, non-violence and restraint after gunfire and explosions were heard near Mr Mugabe's compound. :: How Zimbabwe's economy has collapsed under Mugabe:: Gucci Grace - Who is Zimbabwe's first lady? On Monday, the head of the armed forces had warned that a ""purge"" of government political figures who had taken part in the 1970s wars of independence had to ""stop"". The sacking of the vice president and Mr Mugabe's likely successor Emmerson Mnangagwa, last week, was seen as clearing the way for Mrs Mugabe to take over from her husband, after she won the support of ZANU-PF's youth wing. The military said it was taking control of the streets, blocking roads to the parliament and court to target ""criminals"". The head of the youth wing of Zimbabwe's ruling party appeared on state television on Wednesday night, to apologise to the military. Kudzai Chipanga said he had voluntarily given his statement apologising for denigrating defence forces chief General Constantino Chiwenga. Bowden said many people he had spoken to felt it could be the end of Mr Mugabe, who had maintained an iron grip on the southern African former British colony for 37 years. He said: ""Everybody you speak to doesn't know the outcome of what is going to happen here - but everybody knows this is a seminal moment in the history of this country. ""It seems as though this is the endgame for Robert Mugabe. Now all we need to know is how it is managed. ""Does he leave the country saving face? Does he stay here as some kind of titular head with the government being run by somebody else? It's unknowable."""
2017-11-16,"The amount of money MPs are spending on security has skyrocketed following the murder of Jo Cox, new figures show.

IPSA chair Ruth Evans said the rise was a reminder that ""we take the security of MPs, and that of their families and their staff, very seriously"". The figure is 14 times that of the previous year, and forms part of the annual report of MPs expenses. Topping the list of claims was Labour's Jamie Reed with Â£243,279, with the SNP's Alex Salmond just behind with Â£235,128. Mr Reed stood down from the Copeland seat he had represented since 2005 at the June general election, while Mr Salmond was ousted from his Gordon seat. Other SNP MPs - including Brendan O'Hara, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh and Alison Thewliss - heavily dominated the top 10 claimers. MPs total spends in 2016/17:: Office costs - Â£11.5m:: Staffing - Â£84.7m:: Accommodation - Â£7.7m:: Travel and subsistence - Â£5.3m:: Other - Â£60,000 Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell was the lowest living claimer in the Commons last year, with expenses of just Â£3,054. The total bill to the taxpyaer for accommodation alone was Â£7.7m - up from Â£7.26 in 2016. But the oversall cost of running MPs' offices fell by Â£3.7m - likely because the previous year included a general election, which saw winding up and redundancy payments for those who lost their seats."

He is the third person to be arrested on suspicion of Gaia's murder, with a 19-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman released under investigation earlier in the week. Confirmation of the latest arrest came just hours after police revealed they had found items of women's clothing in a field near Swanage. DS Kessel said: ""We have arrested a 49-year-old male on suspicion of murder. He is believed to be known to Gaia and is from the Swanage area. ""We have been conducting this inquiry for two weeks and it's our responsibility to explore every avenue of inquiry. That's important to us. ""We continue to investigate whether Gaia has come to harm through an act of crime or whether she is missing."" He said the search would likely continue ""for some time"" but that it was a ""fast moving investigation"" and there was ""no reason to believe"" Gaia had left the Swanage area. He refused to describe the investigation as a murder inquiry. Police are also said to be pursuing ""a number of other avenues of investigation"". Gaia's ""deeply concerned"" family continues to be supported by specialist officers, DS Kessel said. He continued: ""I would like to offer my thoughts and thanks to her family, who are going through an incredibly distressing time. ""I would also like to thank the public, particularly of Swanage and the local community, who have been incredibly supportive and understanding of the police operation into Gaia's disappearance."" The owner of the clothes found earlier on Thursday has not been identified, police said, but detectives involved in the search for Gaia have informed her family of the find. The teenager, from Langton Matravers, was staying at an address in Swanage when she disappeared. She was wearing grey and white woven leggings, white trainers and a red checked shirt with white buttons. Searches of the land and coastline in the area, by air, land, and sea, have been ongoing since she disappeared. Two addresses were searched on Monday and three vehicles have been seized. :: Anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

She was being driven by a relative between Langton Matravers and Swanage when they stopped off for fuel at St Michael's Garage on Valley Road, Dorset Police said. A 19-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman - who are both known to Miss Pope - were arrested on suspicion of her murder but have since been released ""under investigation"".

2017-11-16,Shoppers turned to charity shops and other second-hand outlets last month as retail sales struggled amid rising store prices.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171117014402/https://news.sky.com/story/shoppers-turn-to-charity-stores-as-prices-climb-11128570,"Sales volumes rose by just 0.3% compared to a dire September and were down 0.3% compared to the same month last year - the first year-on-year decline since 2013. Food sales led the downturn, with their sharpest year-on-year fall for five years, as the grocery sector saw the biggest annual price increases, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. Clothing retailers also suffered, suggesting mild October weather delayed purchases of winter outfits, the ONS said. The figures were slightly ahead of City expectations though growth was led by second-hand outlets - a category including charity shops, auction houses, antiques and fine art dealers. ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: ""We are continuing to see an underlying picture of steady growth in retail sales, although this October suffered in comparison with a very strong October in 2016."" The figures come as food prices are rising at their fastest pace in four years, while the wider Consumer Prices Index (CPI) is running at a five-year high of 3%. That is well ahead of wage growth and means that in real terms pay has been falling for seven months in succession. Meanwhile, figures this week showed UK employment fell in the three months to September, prompting concerns from some experts that an extended period of jobs growth could be coming to an end as the wider economy stutters. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""With real incomes under pressure from subdued nominal wage growth and rising inflation, it isn't surprising that spending growth has lost further momentum. ""That said, there are reasons to think that sales growth won't slow much further. ""For a start, with unusually warm weather hitting purchases of winter clothing ranges, there is scope for a rebound in clothing sales over the coming months now the weather has turned more seasonal."" But James Smith, economist at ING Bank, said that the squeeze on consumers was likely to mean a continued ""cautious approach to spending for at least a couple more quarters"". ""Sluggish growth is a key reason why we think another rate hike from the Bank of England next year is not fully guaranteed,"" he added. Last week, the British Retail Consortium said trading levels in the run-up to Christmas were a ""cause for concern"" with non-food sales performance at the worst level since its records began in 2011. Meanwhile, supermarket group Sainsbury's has reported a slowdown in quarterly sales growth while Marks & Spencer's has faced a tougher period for food sales, until recently the stand-out division of the business as clothing struggles. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""As ever with retail, the Christmas period, which kicks off with Black Friday on 24 November, will be crucial."""

The cross-party committee is warning of possible major border disruption unless urgent action is taken. Criticising the ""insufficient"" work of ministers to prepare for the possibility of Brexit without a divorce deal, the MPs also cite a lack of coordination on the issue across Government. The Government's plan to hire 300 more Border Force staff is branded ""too small"" by the committee as they expressed fears officials being diverted from security and immigration checks to customs checks could leave the UK's borders at risk. In the summer of 2015, a strike by French ferry workers and a surge in attempts by migrants to reach Britain from Calais led to the largest-ever implementation of Operation Stack on the M20. The police action saw miles of lorries parked on the Kent road as they queued to reach Dover. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, the committee's chair, said: ""As things stand, the Government is running the risk of celebrating their first day of Brexit with the sight of queues of lorries stretching for miles in Kent and gridlock on the roads of Northern Ireland, which would be incredibly damaging to the UK economy and completely unacceptable to the country. ""Contingency planning is essential. If the Government gets this all wrong, we could be facing Operation Stack on steroids."" The committee are calling on the Government to swiftly agree a transitional arrangement with the EU which would preserve the status quo on customs arrangements. They also want an increase in the the number of businesses being accredited for an approved operators scheme, ministers to publish detailed plans on the impact on customs arrangements of all Brexit outcomes, and for a single minister to be put in charge of the issue. Responding to the report, a Government spokesperson said: ""We are fully focused on making the UK's exit from the EU, and our new trading relationship with the world, a success. ""We have outlined our proposals for ambitious future trade and customs relationships with the EU and are confident we will reach agreement. ""We will ensure we have the resources we need to continue to run effective customs, borders and immigration systems in the future. ""A good deal with the EU is in our mutual interest. We are optimistic about achieving that, but it is the duty of a responsible government to plan for a range of scenarios, which is exactly what we are doing."" On Tuesday, the Public Accounts Committee warned it would be ""catastrophic"" if a new customs system is not in place by the date of Brexit in 2019. On Wednesday, it was revealed plans for a Â£250m lorry park off the M20 - pitched by the Government as an alternative to Operation Stack - have been dropped."

It was also more than twice the previous auction record - the $179.4m (Â£136.2m) paid in May 2015 for Picasso's Les Femmes D'Alger (Women of Algiers). Jussi Pylkkanen, global president of Christie's and the event's auctioneer, said: ""It was a moment when all the stars were aligned, and I think Leonardo would be very pleased. ""It's a painting beyond anything I've ever handled - I should hang up my gavel."" Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World) is around 26 inches tall and shows Christ dressed in Renaissance-like robes, raising his hand in a blessing and holding a crystal orb. It is thought to date from around 1500 and is one of only about 16 verified da Vinci originals in existence. It was once owned by King Charles I but its whereabouts in the following years were unclear until it was bought in 1900 by a British collector. At that time it was not thought to be the work of da Vinci, but of one of his followers. It was sold again in 1958 and then again in 2005. By then it was badly damaged and partly painted over but the new owners - a group of art dealers who paid less than Â£7,600 for the painting - restored it and documented it as an authentic da Vinci work. Its owner before the auction on Wednesday was billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, the 15th richest person in his native Russia. He paid Â£96.8m for the painting in a private sale in 2013. The auction in New York followed a campaign that saw the work exhibited in Hong Kong, San Francisco, London and New York. The 20-minute bidding war was punctuated by gasps and then applause as the bids reached each milestone. The amount paid included Â£38.2m in fees. As for the buyer, it is up to them whether to reveal their identity. So far, they're keeping quiet. :: Which artwork would you pay an arm and a leg for? Pick your favourite below."
2017-11-16,Transport officials have admitted the abolition of paper car tax discs could be a major factor behind figures suggesting evasion has trebled since 2013.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171117014402/https://news.sky.com/story/wrong-turn-car-tax-disc-abolition-costly-as-evasion-trebles-11128854,"The measure was introduced in October 2014 with the aim of saving the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency(DVLA) up to Â£7m annually. But Department for Transport (DfT) statistics published on Thursday showed lost revenue for cars and light goods vehicles had now accelerated from Â£32m in 2013/14 to as much as Â£97m. Almost 2% of the vehicles using the roads - above 750,000 - were currently breaking the law through not paying the tax, it was estimated. Although demands for Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) payments are still sent to owners in advance by the DVLA, the change meant there was no longer a physical disc to jog drivers' memories about renewal. Motoring groups also pointed to confusion among owners about the tax when selling a vehicle, as the law change also outlawed the transfer of VED. Buyers must now secure their own tax before driving away, with sellers being refunded any full months of remaining VED by the DVLA. The DfT report highlighted too a twelve-fold increase in the number of cars in use despite the owner having applied for a Statutory Off Road Notification or SORN - effectively declaring their vehicle is off the road. DVLA chief executive Oliver Morley said: ""We are cracking down on those who break the law by driving an untaxed vehicle and our message to tax-dodgers is clear: tax it or lose it."" But RAC public affairs manager Nicholas Lyes said the wider figures showed evasion was at a 10-year high and that changes to the system had proved ""extremely costly"". He added: ""The principle of abolishing the tax disc to introduce greater efficiencies has, so far, evidently failed. ""More must be done to educate drivers about how and when to tax their vehicle, coupled with stronger enforcement to genuinely make drivers who evade vehicle tax feel that they are going to get caught. ""From 2020, Vehicle Excise Duty receipts will also directly fund improvements to our strategic road network, so it is vital every effort is made to make sure we tackle evasion so our road network does not lose out on essential investment."""
2017-11-16,"The NHS faces an even greater challenge this winter because hospitals have failed to free up enough beds to cope with increased demand, the health service regulator has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171117014402/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-faces-a-worse-winter-over-failure-to-free-up-beds-says-regulator-11129238,"While hospitals have treated more patients in A&E than a year ago, NHS Improvement (NHSI) says wards remain full and targets to discharge more patients ahead of the winter peak have failed. In a quarterly report published without notice, NHSI said hospital performance had been affected by the national cyber-attack, as well as the terror attacks in Manchester and London and the demands of the Grenfell Tower fire. Just a week before the Budget, the regulator also warned that hospital deficits will soar beyond predicted levels and that plans to cut losses are doomed to fail. The report says the collective deficit for the first six months of 2017-18 was Â£1.15bn, Â£143m more than planned. The predicted year-end deficit is Â£623m, Â£127m more than planned. The financial performance will fuel the demands of those, including NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, who say Chancellor Phillip Hammond must find more money for the NHS in next week's Budget if the service is to continue to deliver what is currently expected of it. Earlier this year, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and NHS England instructed hospitals to reduce the number of ""delayed transfers of care"" (DTOCs), which occur when patients who are medically fit to leave cannot be discharged because they do not have adequate care at home or in the community. Reducing the number to 3.5% of the total number of beds by September, potentially freeing up an estimated 3,000 beds, was central to plans avoid a repeat of last winter's troubles, when some hospitals were forced to turn patients away from A&E. NHSI said that, in fact, there were 168,000 DTOCs in September, accounting for 5% of all beds. ""Although there has been some success in reducing the number of delayed discharges from hospital beds, over the second quarter of the year there were around 168,000 delayed discharges, accounting for 5% of NHS beds,"" NHSI said. ""This is substantially higher than the stated ambition of reducing delayed discharges to 3.5% by September."" Jim Mackey, the watchdog's chief executive, said: ""While we are working across the NHS to prepare for winter pressures, they may be difficult and will place the system under even greater pressures."" NHSI warned the financial position is likely to deteriorate further over the winter. The Government is under pressure to provide a minimum of Â£4bn more to the NHS in the Budget, as well as funding a pay rise for staff above the 1% pay cap, which is due to be lifted. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital and ambulance trusts, said: ""These figures underline the extremely difficult conditions trusts face in providing safe, timely, high-quality care for patients. ""It is to their enormous credit that in the midst of a prolonged and severe financial squeeze and workforce shortages they have responded to growing demand by treating more patients than ever."""
2017-11-16,"The black market for erectile dysfunction drugs is booming as more young men are using the medicine as a recreational party pill, Sky News has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171117014402/https://news.sky.com/story/seizures-soar-as-erectile-dysfunction-drugs-used-as-party-pills-11128200,"Figures obtained by Sky News reveal the scale of unlicensed erectile dysfunction drug smuggling into the UK by post, ports and dealers has sharply increased over the past five years to meet demand. The medicine regulator seized Â£2.5m of illicit pills in 2012-13. By 2016 that had increased to Â£17.4m, bringing the total seized over the past five years to Â£49.4m. Erectile dysfunction drugs now account for 90% of all captured counterfeit drugs. Sexual psychotherapist Raymond Francis says many of his young patients use the pills as an insurance policy for performance. He told Sky News his patients include an increasing number of young men, typically under the age of 35, invariably not in long-term relationships. He said: ""I believe their dependence on Viagra for recreational reasons, if you like, is driven to some degree by the plethora of sexual imagery through pornography which is so instantly available."" Mr Francis, who works at Harley Street's Apex Practice, said he has not encountered any patients with physiological issues. However, they became psychologically dependent on taking the drug in order to live up to the unrealistic portrayal of male sexual performance promoted in pornography. He said: ""This is one of the last few remaining taboos in modern society today, even in this day and age of openness, male sexual performance is one of the few matters in life which is really considered deeply confidential."" Many young men are also trying the drug in an attempt to counter the effects of alcohol and other drugs. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said that, despite often being marketed as harmless sweets with fruity flavours, some unlicensed samples can contain toxic chemicals such as lead and arsenic - as criminal gangs have become attracted to the lucrative market. Danny Lee-Frost, head of operations for Enforcement Group, told Sky News: ""They dwarf anything else we seize. ""When I first started doing this you'd get people flying out to India for a fortnight holiday and then coming back with a couple of suitcases, their mates designed them a little website and they were dealing it all from their spare bedroom. ""Now you've got organised crime involved, you've got the websites hosted in places like Russia, you've got the money going out to the Cayman Islands, you've got this stuff being smuggled in. ""It's a big, big business."" Other samples seized by the regulator had well over the licenced 100mg of the active ingredient in Sildenafil. Drug dealers are increasingly selling unlicensed pills due to the level of demand and the MHRA is running a #FakeMeds campaign to warn people against buying potentially dangerous sold by illegal online suppliers."

Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said that ""specialist teams working inside Grenfell Tower and the mortuary have pushed the boundaries of what was scientifically possible to identify people."" ""After the fire was finally put out, I entered Grenfell Tower and was genuinely concerned that due to the intensity and duration of the fire, that we may not find, recover and then identify all those who died,"" he said. ""I know that each and every member of the team has done absolutely all they can to make this possible."" Many of the victims were only identifiable through their dental records or DNA testing. Immediately after the 14 June fire, 400 people were listed as missing, but footage later showed that 223 people had escaped, while others were not at home. One person was reported missing 46 times, while others were reported to authorities under different names. Scotland Yard is conducting a criminal investigation that may consider individual as well as corporate manslaughter charges."

It concerned an alleged assault on an eight-year-old autograph hunter at a community centre in Portsmouth in 1968 or 1969. The alleged victim claimed that Harris had groped her. The judges rejected applications by the 87-year-old artist and musician to challenge the other 11 convictions, which included two indecent assaults on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter's friend over a period of 16 years. All of the assaults took place between 1968 and 1986. The Australian-born TV presenter had been convicted at London's Southwark Crown Court in June 2014 and was jailed for five years and nine months, but was released in May this year. He was not in court for Thursday's ruling and the prosecution did not seek a retrial, with the judges agreeing that a further trial would not be in the public interest."

The Prime Minister's spokesperson denied the move had anything to do with Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case. Sky's Defence Correspondence Alistair Bunkall said the money should not be considered a ransom payment. ""This is effectively Iran's money and they want it back,"" he said. ""Officially, the Â£450m debt and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release are two separate issues - the UK Government doesn't pay ransoms. ""But Iran, particularly the Revolutionary Guard, will want something in return for her release, and payment of this debt could be it."" He added that while the debt has been neither demanded by Iran nor offered by the UK, the story was likely revealed to ""test Iranian reaction and, to a lesser extent, British public opinion"". The money was paid to the UK by Iran's former Shah in exchange for 1,750 Chieftain tanks. But he was toppled in the revolution of 1979 and the full order cancelled. The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2001 that the outstanding funds should be returned. Asked about reports the debt repayment could be used to help free Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Prime Minister's spokesperson said: ""We are clear that we don't see any link between these two issues. That's not something I recognise."" Boris Johnson is trying to secure the jailed mother's release. He apologised to her on Monday for the ""further anguish"" caused by his previous claim she was ""training journalists"" when she was visiting Tehran in 2016."

Mr Edmonds' losses were suffered when his former business, Unique Group, was allegedly destroyed by the Â£245m loans scam carried out by HBOS Reading staff between 2003 and 2007. The corrupt financiers from the branch, who squandered the profits on high-end prostitutes and luxury holidays, were jailed earlier this year. Mr Edmonds will now take his case to court, his lawyer Jonathan Coad confirmed. ""One reason for our confidence is that, back in 2008, when the bank sued Noel on its personal guarantee, such was the adverse legal advice it was getting from its then lawyers that it bribed Noel's business partner to the tune of around Â£1m to stop him supporting Noel's defence,"" Mr Coad said. ""Since then the bank's primary witness has been jailed, which greatly weakens its position."" :: Noel Edmonds reveals suicide bid after firm collapsed Mr Edmonds claims there is a culture of ""dishonesty and concealment at Lloyds, which goes right to the top"" and said he looked forward to exposing it during a trial. Lloyds has set aside Â£100m for the victims, but a spokeswoman said it rejected the claim that it had caused Mr Edmonds' firm to collapse. She said: ""Despite Lloyds Banking Group's determined efforts to reach a consensual resolution with Mr Edmonds through mediation, this has not been possible. As a result, a formal litigation process has begun. ""We recognise Mr Edmonds suffered personal distress and inconvenience as a result of him interacting almost a decade ago with an ex-HBOS employee convicted earlier this year in relation to criminal conduct at HBOS Reading Impaired Assets office. However, we strongly refute that this caused his business to collapse."" A number of other businesses were destroyed as a result of the loans scam. The bank has so far put forward 40 offers to companies affected, with 31 having accepted payouts totalling Â£27m."
2017-11-16,Convicted mass murderer Charles Manson has been taken to hospital and is reported to be in a serious condition.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171117014402/https://news.sky.com/story/serial-killer-charles-manson-taken-to-hospital-in-serious-condition-11128403,"The 83-year-old former cult leader was taken to a Bakersfield, California hospital from California State Prison on Tuesday, US reports said. He is serving seven life sentences for killing and instructing to kill seven people in 1969. Authorities with the Kern County Sheriff's Department confirmed to the Los Angeles Times the Manson was in hospital but said his condition was ""unclear"". A source familiar with his condition told TMZ that ""it's not going to get any better for him"" and ""it's just a matter of time"". He is being guarded by five police officers at all times, TMZ said. A spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation declined to discuss the health of an inmate, citing privacy laws. In January Manson was taken to hospital for severe intestinal bleeding and needed surgery, but doctors said he was too weak and sent him back to prison. Manson led a cult known as the Manson Family in the late 1960s in which he instructed female followers to kill in a bid to initiate a race war. His followers committed nine murders at four locations. In 1971 the killer, who has a swastika tattooed on his forehead, was convicted of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including Sharon Tate, who was the wife of Hollywood director Roman Polanski. Manson has been in jail for more than 45 years. His death sentence was changed to seven life terms after California banned the capital punishment. He has been denied parole 12 times, most recently in 2012."

He had been trying to reach the Yaifo, a reclusive tribe that he had met on a similar trip about three decades ago. His wife Lenka Allen told the Daily Mail their children - 10-year-old Natalya, Freddie, seven, and two-year-old Beatrice - regularly ask when their father is coming home. Mrs Allen told the newspaper: ""The little one, Beatrice, is always saying 'Daddy' and she's trying to telephone him on my mobile, looking at his photo on the screen. ""They all sense the tension in the flat and they are worried deep down. ""The two other ones, they are saying: 'When is daddy coming so we can go shopping, just me and you, and Daddy can babysit', that sort of thing. But of course now they know he's in danger, they are seriously worried."" She added that ""everything possible"" is going through her head, fearing he had been bitten by a snake, got lost or contracted an illness - but added: ""He does know a lot about the jungle.""

On Wednesday, his sister, Katy Pestille, told Sky News that it was the second time he had gone missing. She recalled: ""When he was younger he went from the mouth of the Amazon to the mouth of the Orinoco, through all this uncharted terrain. He was the first person to do that. It's a long, long way and he was absent for six months and missing for three, so we've been through all this before. ""Not knowing where he was for three months was really, really awful.

He added: ""He left with no plan, he had no evacuation plan, he didn't give anybody any idea of where he was going. ""It's hardly surprising that he's missed his flight and he's caused a lot of people to be very worried about him. People who care about him. But he's an extremely tough, resilient and curious traveller. ""He likes to immerse himself among people. I'm not sure that he's that good at logistics because he's really caused a lot of people a lot of worry - including myself because I'm his friend and I knew this was going to be quite a tricky trip. ""And I wish he had taken some little safety net. I know he didn't want to take a satellite phone with him or a GPS or anything else. He didn't want any kind of modern intrusion.

The action plan includes the first internet code of conduct with a ""green cross code"" style advertising campaign. The 'Stop, Speak, Support' slogan is said to be the first campaign of its kind in the world led by young people. Facebook and Snapchat have also worked with the NSPCC to create new functions to help bullying victims, which will be trialled by young people. Social media and gaming firms have agreed to design safety guidelines, and there will be a universal strategy to help parents and children access support groups and services. The task force brought together organisations including Facebook, Snapchat, Google and Sky. Charities, parents and young people added their insight. In a statement Jeremy Darroch, Group chief executive at Sky, said: ""Cyber-bullying is a real concern for millions of young people and their parents, and we need to do all we can to protect those who are vulnerable to the damage it can cause. ""All of us at Sky take great pride in our support of the Royal Foundation Taskforce, and we will do what we can to use Sky's voice to promote the code and ensure its important message is heard as widely as possible.""

Mr Varadkar was speaking after Prime Minister Theresa May said not enough progress has been made to move the negotiations onto the second phase - Britain's future trading relationship with the bloc. For the talks to proceed, European leaders need to be of the view that ""sufficient progress"" has been made on three divorce issues - the exit bill, citizens' rights and the Irish border. Mr Varadkar struck a pessimistic note, telling Sky News that while he had a ""very good and constructive meeting"" with Mrs May at a summit in Sweden, ""I can't say in any honesty that it's close, either on the Irish issue or the financial settlement"". The Irish PM said he wanted there to be progress, but he told Sky's Lewis Goodall that more realism was needed from London. Mr Varadkar said: ""Ireland's trading relationship with Britain is enormous and of course we want to have a new trade arrangement. ""But we should never forget that Brexit is a British policy, it's one that Britain has imposed on the rest of Europe and it's causing enormous difficulties for all of Europe and Ireland in particular. ""To me it seems that after 40 years of marriage, most of them good, Britain now wants a divorce and wants an open relationship the day after. ""And that's a very difficult position to accept, but I'm sure we'll work something out."" When asked if he would be willing to veto moving the talks onto the next phase, Mr Varadkar said he was ""not in the business of threatening vetoes"", but did not explicitly rule it out. In separate remarks to journalists covering the summit, Mr Varadkar was much more forceful. He said: ""Before we move to phase two talks on trade, we want taken off the table any suggestion that there will be a physical border, a hard border, new barriers to trade on the island of Ireland. ""If we have to wait until the New Year, if we have to wait for further concessions, so be it."" Mr Varadkar added: ""It's 18 months since the referendum, it's 10 years since people who wanted a referendum started agitating for one. ""Sometimes it doesn't seem like they have thought all this through."" On the subject of the border, Mr Varadkar told Sky News ""it would be very difficult for us to accept anything other than a written commitment that the British government means what it says"". Earlier on Friday, Ireland's foreign minister said ""serious issues"" concerning the UK-Irish border after Brexit mean trade talks should be delayed and a five-year transition period implemented. Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary David Davis suggested he wanted to see compromise from Brussels, warning EU leaders in an interview that they will get ""nothing...for nothing"". When asked about Mr Davis' claim, European Council President Donald Tusk said: ""I can say only that I appreciate Mr Davis' English sense of humour."" Mr Tusk has set a deadline for the start of December for Britain to make progress on the divorce bill and the Irish border. Speaking after talks with Mrs May, he said Brussels has finished the internal work required to green light trade talks at the forthcoming European Council summit on 14-15 December. ""We will be ready to move on to the second phase already in December, but in order to do that we need to see more progress from the UK side,"" Mr Tusk said. ""While good progress on citizens' rights is being made, we need to see much more progress on Ireland and on the financial settlement."" Downing Street has dismissed reports suggesting Britain could be ready to offer another Â£20bn to Brussels to break the logjam on the exit bill."

2017-11-17,"More than six million people have had their credit card limits increased without their consent in the last year, research from Citizens Advice suggests.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171118014744/https://news.sky.com/story/six-million-see-credit-extended-without-consent-study-11129611,"The organisation also found that consumers struggling financially were more likely to given extra credit - adding to concerns about the build-up of household debt. Citizens Advice said lenders were ""actively pushing"" more borrowing without considering who could afford it. It has been calling for a ban on unsolicited credit limit increases to help prevent people from accruing debts they cannot pay back - something it says puts individuals as well as the wider economy at risk. Industry body UK Finance said providers were committed to responsible lending. According to Citizens Advice, 28% of credit card holders - equivalent to 8.4 million people - received a credit limit increase over the past year. But only 23% of those actually asked for the rise, with the remaining increases initiated by lenders. The study also found that 32% of credit card holders who were not confident they could pay back their debts were given a credit increase. That was a higher proportion than the 23% of those who were confident having limits raised. On average, credit card holders were given rises of Â£1,481 without being asked - with one in ten receiving increases of Â£3,000 or more. The research was based on a ComRes survey of more than 1,300 credit card holders. Citizens Advice gave the example of a woman who had asked for help after building up credit card debt of Â£3,500 that she was unable to pay back. She initially had a credit limit of Â£500 to pay unexpected bills - but the limit was extended when she reached it, and then extended multiple times thereafter. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""Few consumers support unsolicited increases and our research shows that they make people's debt problems worse. ""The Chancellor must step in to prevent credit card companies weighing people down with unwanted debt - particularly when they are already struggling to keep their heads above water."" Richard Koch, head of cards at UK Finance, said: ""The industry has come together to voluntarily agree new protocols to ask customers whether they would prefer to opt out or opt in for any credit limit increase offers. ""Furthermore, the customers who the Financial Conduct Authority and Citizens Advice are most concerned about will be excluded from receiving any such offers."" The study comes amid concerns from the Bank of England about the scale of unsecured lending."
2017-11-17,Britain's biggest building society Nationwide has reported a fall in first-half profits and warned it could face tougher trading in coming months amid the squeeze on consumers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171118014744/https://news.sky.com/story/nationwide-warns-of-tougher-times-as-consumers-face-squeeze-11129669,"Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September fell 10% to Â£628m, though the lender said earnings would have increased but for one-off gains reported in the same period last year. Nationwide said it was expecting the UK economy to continue to grow, though at a slower rate ""due to the uncertainties around Brexit"". Chief executive Joe Garner said: ""The second half may bring tougher trading conditions, but we remain well placed to stand by our members in these uncertain times."" The building society reported that gross mortgage lending fell by 5% to Â£16.7bn while impairment losses - a charge related to debts that go bad - nearly doubled to Â£59m. Nationwide said loans were continuing to perform well but it had hiked the accounting provision amid ""emerging indications that affordability is under more pressure from the impact of inflation"". Mr Garner said that despite the recent interest rate rise, borrowing costs overall remained low. But he acknowledged that low wage growth and rising inflation were ""putting pressure on household budgets"" and said the lender was ""alert to signs of financial strain on consumers"". Mr Garner said: ""A number of financial factors are weighing on the economy and our members. ""On the one hand, employment is at or close to historic highs. ""On the other, uncertainty appears to be holding back investment, wages are shrinking in real terms, and inflation has ticked up to its highest level in in five years. ""Annual house price growth has moderated to 2% to 4% in recent months. ""And of course, uncertainty about Brexit continues."" Mr Garner said the numbers of mortgage loans remained strong. But he added: ""We're prepared for the possibility that intense competition combined with declining consumer confidence may lead to a moderation in gross lending and market share in the second half of the year."" Nationwide said it had helped a record 39,500 first-time buyers purchase a home over the six-month period, up from 38,600 a year ago, though the number of those moving or remortgaging was down slightly from 48,500 to 47,700. The building society said it also saw record growth in current accounts, adding 427,000."

His remarks, at a news conference in front of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, could spark fresh fears over the progress of Brexit talks. Having first revealed that he backed a five-year transition 10 days ago, Mr Coveney repeated the claim on Friday - much to the surprise of Mr Johnson. Asked for his reaction, the Foreign Secretary said: ""Well I must confess that I wasn't aware of the proposal from Simon for such a long transitional period. ""But I think I understand the sentiment behind it which is that everybody wants to have the maximum possible reassurance. I think it's possible to do that within a much shorter timescale."" The admission sparked anger from some, one Labour source branding it a ""blunder"" that showed he was ""simply not up to the job"". Foreign Affairs Committee member Chris Bryant also said it was ""inconceivable"" Mr Johnson did not know or had not been briefed on Ireland's position. Meanwhile, Open Britain supporter Ben Bradshaw told Sky News: ""It is astounding that Boris Johnson was unaware of the Irish government's position, given Ireland's central importance in the Brexit talks. ""Not only does Mr Johnson fail to read his official briefs, he clearly doesn't read the newspapers. ""His cavalier and slapdash approach is typical of this Government's amateurish and damaging approach to Brexit."" :: Davis hints at higher Brexit bill offer An energetic Mr Johnson later quipped that it was time to get on to the ""meat"" of negotiations. This appeared to rile Mr Coveney, who said the border issue preventing talks moving on to trade were very much the ""meat"" of discussions. He added there were ""very serious issues"" that the UK needed to ""be a lot clearer"" on, describing the current state of negotiations as an ""impasse"". Sky News has contacted Mr Johnson and the Foreign Office for clarification on what they knew of Ireland's position on the transition period. It came amid conflicting reports of Prime Minister Theresa May's meeting with her Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar at an EU summit. Downing Street said both leaders held ""constructive"" talks, agreeing to ""work together to find solutions"" to the border issue."
2017-11-17,A group of nurseries is banning children from using glitter over concerns about pollution.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171118014744/https://news.sky.com/story/nurseries-ban-glitter-over-pollution-concerns-11129536,"Tops Day Nurseries - a chain of 19 daycares across southern England - is outlawing the sparkly substance used by thousands of children to make Christmas cards and baubles at this time of year. Managing director Cheryl Hadland said she made the decision after realising glitter is a microplastic which can harm the environment. :: Sky Ocean Rescue: How to get involved She said: ""You can see when the children are taking their bits of craft home and there's glitter on the cardboard, it blows off and into the air and on to the road, and it's only a tiny little bit, but we've got 3,000 children and they're all doing Christmas craft at the moment, so we've got glitter everywhere. ""There are 22,000 nurseries in the country, so if we're all getting through kilos and kilos of glitter, we're doing terrible damage, and these children, the world is for them. ""So here we are wrecking the place for them, and I didn't even know. I've been running the nurseries for 27 years and I had no idea that we were doing all that damage. ""You can't really recycle it because it's so small, you can't separate it from anything."" :: Plastic pollution reaches ocean's deepest parts Ms Hadland, from Bournemouth, added: ""I love glitter, it's lovely, shiny, twinkly stuff, so it is kind of sad, but when we're wrecking the environment we really can't be doing it. So we're just going to have to start getting our heads round using stuff that's more sustainable."" She said the decision has only just been made so parents may not be aware of it, but she insisted they are likely to be supportive. She said: ""We did a survey a few months ago and 86% of our parents want us to be eco-sustainable. I think a lot of our parents really want us to do this."" :: Shocking photos emerge of 'sea of plastic' Many parents who use her nurseries are millennials, she said, who are likely to want a sustainable education for their child. Sue Kinsey from the Marine Conservation Society praised the ""proactive approach"". ""The majority of microplastics that get into the sea come from personal care products, household cleaners, tyre wear and other sources,"" she said. ""While glitter is only a small part of the microplastic load getting into watercourses and the sea, steps like these will all add up to something greater. ""This is a very proactive approach, amongst lots of things that the nursery is doing to help the environment, like using cloth aprons and not releasing balloons outdoors, and it is definitely possible to create a Christmas card to take home without using glitter."""

Dorset Police revealed news of the arrest on Thursday - the third to be made on suspicion of murder following the arrests of a 71-year-old woman and a 19-year-old man, both of whom were also known to Gaia and were released under investigation earlier this week. Confirmation of Thursday's arrest came just hours after police revealed they had found items of women's clothing in a field near Swanage, which police have now confirmed are a match for what Gaia, 19, is believed to have been wearing when she went missing. Gaia, from Langton Matravers, is said to have been wearing a red checked shirt with white buttons, grey and white woven leggings and white trainers when she was last seen at an address in Manor Gardens on Morrison Road, Swanage on 7 November. Extensive searches of the land and coastline in the area, by air, land, and sea, have been ongoing since she disappeared and on Friday her mother, Natasha Pope, posted an emotional appeal for further help in finding her daughter on the Facebook group, FIND GAIA. She wrote: ""I believe in this community and I believe miracles can happen. I am holding onto hope, along with Gaia's sisters and the whole family who are my strength. ""Please hold on with us. My eternal thanks to everyone who is out there searching for my little girl. Please come out over the weekend and do what you can. Every one of you makes a difference."" Detective Superintendent Paul Kessell said on Friday that the search for Gaia would continue ""over many square miles"" of varied terrain, from grassland to cliffs on the coast. He continued: ""Yesterday and today specialist officers and teams, supported by Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue, the coastguard, national search advisors and the NPAS helicopter, have been conducting detailed searches and forensic examinations of fields and open areas. ""Wide area searches have also been carried out with the assistance of Dorset Search and Rescue and volunteers in the community. Our search area spans over many square miles of grassland, gorse, bracken and undulating difficult terrain and the public can expect to see officers continuing searches there for a number of days and beyond. ""We would like to repeat our thanks to them for their support and understanding as our large scale investigation continues. The community will be aware that this rural area surrounding Purbeck is a wide expanse of challenging ground, much of which is exposed to the elements. ""In addition, the cliffs along the coast are dangerous and the seas can be unpredictable. While we are grateful to the public's ongoing help, I would like to advise them not to put themselves in danger and to allow the specially-trained experts to cover this area in a controlled manner.

Sky News Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said the British Government has offered to assist, with an A C130 Hercules stationed in the Falklands Islands on standby if required. It has been two days since ARA San Juan provided its last location and navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said heavy winds and high waves were complicating efforts. ""Detection has been difficult despite the quantity of boats and aircraft"" involved in the search, Mr Balbi said. He said the vessel may be suffering from a communications error. ""We are investigating the reasons for the lack of communication. If there was a communication problem, the boat would have to come to the surface."" The British government has offered help to the Argentine government in the search for its missing submarine. A C130 Hercules, currently stationed in the Falkland Islands, is on standby to assist if required. Mr Balbi said the submarine, which left the southern city of Ushuaia for Mar del Plata, more than 1,800 miles away, has food supply for several days and is likely to continue its journey despite the problem. According to national Argentinian newspaper La Nacion, the 66-metre long, diesel-electric vessel was subjected to complex repair and engineering work in 2008, which the country's navy believed would extend its life by 30 years. It was built in Germany in 1985 and arrived in Argentina a year later. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri said the government was in contact with the crew's families. ""We share their concern and that of all Argentines,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""We are committed to using all national and international resources necessary to find the ARA San Juan submarine as soon as possible."""

The allegations relate to two incidents in 2006 when Franken, a former host of the Saturday Night Live show, was working as a comedian and the pair were preparing to perform before US troops in Afghanistan. Tweeden said the 66-year-old - who says his actions have made him feel ""ashamed"" - wrote a skit that included a kiss between the two and said he insisted upon rehearsing it, which she at first resisted. She wrote: ""He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said 'okay' so he would stop badgering me. ""We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth."" She said she pushed Franken away but felt disgusted and violated. Tweeden also said the former comedian groped her while she slept during their flight home from Afghanistan. She posted a photo taken on the trip in which Franken is shown grinning at the camera while putting his hands on her chest as she naps. ""I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated,"" Tweeden wrote. ""How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it's funny?"" Franken quickly issued an apology in a statement, saying: ""I certainly don't remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. ""As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it. ""I don't know what was in my head when I took that picture, and it doesn't matter. There's no excuse. I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn't funny. It's completely inappropriate. ""Coming from the world of comedy, I've told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realise were just plain offensive. ""I respect women. I don't respect men who don't. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed."" Tweeden said she accepted his apology but that he could have done it sooner. Franken, who was elected to the Senate in 2009, echoed a call from senators that he be investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee, and said he would ""gladly cooperate"". The accusations come just days after the Senate unanimously adopted mandatory sexual harassment training for members and staff amid a flood of harassment, sexual misconduct and gender hostility claims."

There is a tension between being a campaigning husband and a real husband. On one hand, there is a way in which supporting Nazanin is about getting her out as quickly as possible - campaigning and battling and pushing and telling her story as effectively as I can. And then there's the real relationship that's just about listening and caring and emotional life - that can get squeezed. Nazanin has told me there are times when I have not done or said the right thing. She can be quite clear sometimes. She looks to me to solve the problems and to understand everything and she gets frustrated by the fact that I don't. A lot of what has happened is uncharted and undiscovered as yet. There's a lot Nazanin can't possibly share and even if she shared, I'm not sure I would understand the words. There are times when she has got angry with me - when she is not angry with me as much as angry with the situation. :: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: A timeline I can feel a shaking frustration: ""You promised me something and it's not going to happen. Why?"" There is no reassurance I can offer other than I'm still here, I care and you are not alone. That's where the support I get from campaigning is important as I can share that with her - all that love and care out there. I would have been pottering around when I found out she wasn't coming home. Nazanin was on holiday. I was having a nice couple of weeks to myself, without toys on the floor. I was due to pick her up from Gatwick Airport at 8am. I was in bed when I got the phone call from her family saying she had not caught the flight. In truth I didn't really get it. Her family went to the airport but were sent home to wait for a phone call. But there was no phone call. Those first three days were the most panicky time. Her mum and dad were terrified. All of our imaginations were running wild. I had seen a film with Nazanin about the revolution. People disappeared. When she was finally allowed to call, I was so relieved. She said she was being held, was safe and had a kebab for lunch. She wasn't allowed to talk about anything else. Gabriella was safe with her grandparents but I knew she would be missing her mum. Until that point, Nazanin had left her only once for one night, with me. In the weeks that followed, I met people through people who had been in prison in Iran. When they told me their stories, that's when the shock really hit. They described the structures of cruelty, the psychological pressure, the isolation, the abuse and the relentless interrogation with the light on all the time while in solitary confinement. She was alone. All I could think of was I had left her alone. I thought I need to do something and I don't know what. It was stronger than guilt. I felt I had let her down. I don't feel that now. What drives me now is the sense that I want her to know that I've not let her down. I've done what I could for her. Three weeks after she was arrested, I knew I needed to go public. But it was stressful. I couldn't be sure, am I going to have to go against her family? It was a very hard period. After that, it went through phases. It was a whirlwind at first. I remember the minister - a UK government minister - telling me I need to be in therapy. I don't think he meant it fully. We set up an e-petition which quite soon became an important community for the campaign. Within 10 days we had half a million signatures. I was sending out emails to half a million people. I was pretty sure it was going to take a few months. Worst-case scenario, I thought it might take up until Christmas. She didn't come home. My low point was when the appeal failed in January. After that, I didn't allow myself to think she is coming out in five years. I thought that she will be out at Christmas, in August, and so on. I've had no routine. It keeps changing. One minute it's full on media. In July, there was much less media attention so I tried to do human rights things - like working with Redress on proving Nazanin's rights had been violated and the Government had to do something. It takes a lot of meetings. You find it out through your own mistakes. When campaigning doesn't work, you ask yourself what else is missing. At first, for all of us, we made it feel temporary. But then it became less temporary. We had to get Gabriella a nursery in Tehran, but I am just a bloke at the end of the phone. There is a limit to what I can do for her. Nazanin's mum, who Gabriella lives with, will do what she thinks is right, in consultation with what her daughter wants. Her mum can't speak English and I can't speak Farsi so the ability for us to debate stuff is not there. I don't get frustrated at all. I get irritable but I try to worry about the things that need worrying about the most - things I can make a difference to. Most of the time it feels like I'm juggling badly. I feel that Gabriella is in safe hands but I'm aware that I'm missing out on all the changes she goes through and all the joy that there is in, for example, the little cheeky games children play. At the moment, I speak to Nazanin twice a week, for an hour and sometimes more. Back in the day, even in June, it was one call every couple of months - on average for the first year it was about one a month. Gabriella I call three times a week. At the start it was less. It's quite visual. She is not going to waste time on the sound. It needs to be something we can see. Either I watch her doing some dancing or showing her dollies or a dollies' tea party or feeding stuff across the phone, like an apple. Things that you don't need the language for - games. I think she thinks I'm a kind of imaginary phone friend or play mate. One thing her mum does in prison is they will often draw a picture of mummy, daddy and Gabriella, or daddy back in London, to try and reinforce that she has a mummy and daddy. So she has the idea of daddy and then she has the reality, this man that speaks to her on the screen. I try to live in the present. A little bit in the future. I try not to beat myself up about things. I allow myself to muddle through, struggle on; I make mistakes all the time. It's a rough old hand I've been dealt recently, and I'll do my best. That means regularly, I will walk into difficult situations - like meeting the Foreign Secretary - and get through. I feel in the grand scheme of things, does it matter more than the phone call that keeps Nazanin's spirits up? The past couple of weeks, it has gone stratospheric. I've been on the front page of every newspaper. It is unimaginable compared to where we were three weeks ago. It feels like things are moving and movement is good. My greatest fear is inertia. I always feel it's shameful, how could it happen, but it did. I try not to hope, in case it doesn't work.

Superintendent Rebecca Mears of Thames Valley Police said: ""We did a joint response with the fire service, ambulance and now the Air Accident Branch is working with us for a joint investigation while we establish the cause of the crash."" She added that informing the next of kin and supporting them with specialist officers is a priority. The crash happened in Upper Winchendon, close to Waddesdon Manor, on Friday, though a spokeswoman for the estate said it had not happened on its grounds. Both aircraft came from Wycombe Air Park, also known as Booker Airfield, near High Wycombe, which offers flight training. The plane that crashed was a Cessna 152, which has the capacity for one pilot and one passenger. It was built in 1982 and is owned by Airways Aero Associations, which is based at the airfield. It had been flown for almost 14,000 hours as of May. RAF Halton, 10 miles away, said no military aircraft had been involved. The AAIB sent a team to investigate the crash, and a Thames Valley Air Ambulance also went to the scene. A spokesman for Waddesdon Manor told Sky News the crash had happened near Upper Winchendon and staff from the estate had gone to the scene in order to help direct traffic. No one on the estate was harmed and the Manor will be open as usual on Saturday. A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) was previously issued to warn pilots the airfield's air traffic control services would be closed during three 30-minute periods on selected days in November due to a ""staff shortage"". There were closures scheduled for 17 November between 11am-11.30am, 1.30pm-2pm and 4pm-4.30pm. Emergency services were alerted to the accident at 12.06pm - around half an hour after the first closure was due to end. A woman who was walking her dogs at the time of the collision said she heard a helicopter circling overhead ""and then heard sirens"" and smelled smoke. Waddesdon Estate Gardener, Len Bellis, had been working nearby when he heard a ""horrendous noise"" before finding the ""burning wreckage"". Mr Bellis said the aircraft was a ""wreck"" and ""non-existent"", apart from the burning fuselage. A police cordon is in place outside the entrance to the Waddesdon estate."
2017-11-17,"Friday was supposed to be about money, money, money. And not just because the Prime Minister, Theresa May, has come to Sweden, the birthplace of ABBA.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171118014744/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-playing-brexit-whack-a-mole-as-ireland-throws-a-spanner-in-the-works-11131098,"We'd been told that she would make a signal which would placate the EU: that the British government would be willing to offer to settle the Brexit bill once and for all. In so doing, the EU in exchange would finally agree to move beyond the first phase of Brexit talks (yes we're still on phase one) and move onto phase two, the future trading relationship. That isn't how the day worked out. Instead the PM became dogged by an issue much closer to home: Ireland. :: Varadkar: Britain asking for too much in Brexit negotiations Money isn't the only issue about which the PM must satisfy her EU partners by the crucial December European Council deadline. There are two more: one on citizens' rights (for those British who live in the EU and vice versa) and the other on the thorny issue of the Irish border. The Irish government has made it clear that no Brexit outcome which in any way introduces any element of a hard border on the island of Ireland is acceptable to them. The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, talking to me at the close of the summit, has thrown a spanner in the Brexit works by saying that far from being close to a deal on the Irish border, the UK ""isn't even close"". ""I can't say in any honesty that it's close, either on the Irish issue of the financial settlement,"" he said. Mr Varadkar went on: ""Brexit is a British policy, it's also one that Britain has imposed on the rest of Europe. ""It's causing enormous difficulties for the whole of Europe and Ireland in particular and to me it seems that after 40 years of marriage, most of them good, Britain wants a divorce and wants an open relationship that day after."" This will be greeted with dismay in Downing Street. The Irish Prime Minister went on to say that so dissatisfied was he with the British government's ideas on the Irish question to date that he wanted nothing short of a full legal guarantee from the British government to ensure that no hard border would take effect. The problem with that is that the only way to really ensure there is no hard border at all would be for the UK to remain in the customs union and probably the single market too. That would solve the Irish question for Theresa May but it would throw up a thousand others, mainly from her own backbenchers, for whom the price of continued customs union and single market membership would be far too high. For the Prime Minister it must feel she's playing Brexit whack a mole. Every time she beats one problem, a few more appear. But she can't ignore the Irish problem. Because just like the other 26 EU countries, they have the power of veto; over both the final EU deal and whether or not Britain can pass onto the next stage of negotiations. And so it comes to pass that Brexit, where we were meant to take back control, has thrown up a unique historical conundrum. For the first time in the seven or eight century relationship between Britain and Ireland, the Irish exercise power over its larger neighbour. As the Irish PM told me: ""We're negotiating with the strength of 27 states, 26 member states behind us, 400 million people. We're in a very strong position here."" They're determined to use that power and make Mrs May's life that bit harder. And for my money the Irish problem is much worse than the financial one. Ultimately if the difference is 10 billion or 20 or 50, the UK will find the money if it makes the difference. Britain is a Â£1.7trn economy, a few billion here or there is a rounding error. The issues around culture, history and sectarianism between Irish north and south are far more intractable. You can't write a cheque and make them go away. And Brexit brings them back into the open. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Irish question frequently made British governments and prime ministers fall. In the late 20th and early 21st the Europe question did the same. Theresa May has to answer both. Before March 2019. Even she, Super Trouper or not, will find that a Herculean task."

One teenager said Cornick attempted to disguise the knife by placing it up his sleeve but then decided to put it in his blazer pocket. The boy said Cornick then went next door where Mrs Maguire was teaching. ""He just winked and smiled at me as he left the room,"" he said. Another pupil at Corpus Christi Catholic College, Leeds, said Cornick told them how he would ""stab her in the neck, because it was a certain kill"". :: Stabbed teacher Ann Maguire 'stood absolutely no chance', inquest hears One of the children told Cornick he needed help, but he replied: ""If you go and get someone, I'll do it faster and I'll get you too."" Nick Armstrong, the barrister representing Mrs Maguire's husband, told the inquest one of the key issues was why none of the children reported what they were told on that day - 28 April, 2014. A witness said: ""In a high school, someone saying they're going to kill a teacher is just a joke."" The inquest heard previously that the ""intelligent"" but ""weird"" Cornick had clashed with Mrs Maguire after she refused to let him drop Spanish. :: Ann Maguire gasped 'I'm dying' after being stabbed seven times by pupil Will Cornick In November 2014 he was jailed for life for murder and ordered to spend at least 20 years in custody.

2017-11-17,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171118014744/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

The deposed leader is chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe and goes to the event each year. Wearing an academic gown and mortar board, he was cheered by the crowd as he opened the ceremony. Sky News' David Bowden, who is in the capital Harare, said: ""Mugabe is not known as a shrinking violet. He's supremely confident in his own abilities, whatever they might be. I suspect this might be a final act of defiance."" Mr Mugabe's public appearance comes amid reports he has been under house arrest since the coup began on Tuesday. The Zimbabwe war veterans' association said the leader asked for ""a few more days, a few more months"". But Botswana's President, Ian Khama, has said he should stand down. He said: ""I don't think anyone should be president for that amount of time. We are presidents, we are not monarchs. It's just common sense."" Branches of the ruling party have turned against him, issuing votes of no confidence. Mashonaland East province has passed the vote, with another 10 understood to be following. Mr Mugabe reportedly refused to resign at a meeting with generals and was pictured for the first time last night. In the images taken at State House in Harare, he appeared smiling with an army chief and South African envoys. The 93-year-old reportedly arrived in his motorcade from his private residence for the crunch talks, which also included officials from the Southern African Development Community (SADC). ""They met today. He is refusing to step down. I think he is trying to buy time,"" said a source close to the army leadership who declined to be named. Mr Mugabe has been in military custody, reportedly with his wife Grace, since the army stepped in earlier this week, as soldiers blockaded key roads and took over state television. Bowden said: ""He will know that the clock is ticking substantially faster than it has done over the past week. ""He will be out and about today presumably making sure people know he is still a man in command... so that when he does appear on television and says 'I've decided I'm going to gracefully move along' that he will maintain some kind of dignity."" Images of the meeting, published by The Herald newspaper, showed him dressed in a navy blazer and grey trousers alongside army boss General Constantino Chiwenga. In one photo, he was pictured smiling and shaking hands with the military chief. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma, speaking in parliament, said the political situation ""very shortly will be becoming clear"". Grace Mugabe, who was reportedly being lined up as her husband's successor, was not in the photos. There was also no sign of former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose firing last week angered supporters in the military as concern grew that Mrs Mugabe would take his place. Morgan Tsvangirai, a former prime minister and long-time opponent of Mr Mugabe, said he must resign ""in the interest of the people"". He added that ""a transitional mechanism"" would be needed to ensure stability. Wilf Mbanga, the founder, publisher and editor of The Zimbabwean newspaper, told Sky News he believed there were sticking points to Mr Mugabe resigning - the president wants security for his family and to keep his wealth, and assurances he won't be prosecuted when he steps down. Mr Mbanga also claimed foreign ministers from the Southern African Development Community want Mr Mugabe to stay on until December when his ruling Zanu-PF party has its congress and then he can step down - but the Zimbabwean generals want him to go now."

The father had denied the murders of Saros Endris, eight, and his sister Leanor, six, claiming diminished responsibility as a result of depressive disorder. However, following a two-week trial, Mohammed was found guilty of two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. Jurors were told that he appeared normal in the run-up to the deaths. Mohammed pursed his lips and showed no other signs of emotion as he was found guilty on Friday - 30 minutes after the jury retired to deliberate a verdict. He is due to be sentenced on Monday. The verdict comes after the defendant, who suffered burns to his head after setting fire to the passenger side of his cab on the night of the killings, admitted he smothered his children. Mohammed did not give evidence during the trial but his lawyers argued he was depressed about his future and his financial situation. The Uber driver fled in his cab after killing the children at their home in Holland Road in the early hours of 28 October last year. He had bought a fuel can and three litres of petrol the previous day. Ms Teklehaimanot gave evidence at the trial and said her husband was ""a gentle, quiet man"" who did not seem angry in the months before the murders. She said she had been asleep upstairs when Mohammed smothered the children during a half-term ""sleepover"" downstairs. The mother said she was woken up by a fire alarm and thought her children were sleeping when she was unable to wake them. Jackie Hughes, 60, who was staying at her daughter's house directly opposite that night, told Sky News how she dashed across the road to help. ""She (the mother) went back inside into the lounge and I followed her and she bought the child out and she was all limp."" ""I laid her down and went back and she passed me the boy and I could hardly breath myself because I have breathing problems, but she came out collapsed and was wailing, it was a horrible wailing."" ""They were lifeless, I tried CPR but what more can I do."" ""I was just in shock, I didn't realise it was happening to be honest, it was a nightmare."" Despite Mohammed's claims he decided to end his life over financial worries, police enquiries found the family could have lived off Mrs Teklehaimanot's earnings as a care worker. Det Insp Justin Spanner called the case ""absolutely horrific"" and hailed the mother's bravery. He added: ""Had the fire taken hold, and had gas escaped from the pipe, it could have caused an immense explosion and killed even more people than we are dealing with at the moment."""

He then lowered it back down into the depths for safety, unaware he had dropped the device near to a gas pipe 60 metres away. Royal Navy divers made the discovery after the trawlerman reported his find, with Portsmouth-based minehunter HMS Cattistock deployed to the location on Thursday afternoon. The team attached a lifting device to the bomb to safely remove it from the seabed and tow it a safe area one mile away from the pipe. A final dive was conducted to place an explosive charge on the bomb, although due to its age it had been found to be inert and no longer a threat. One of the divers, Officer Lee O'Sullivan, said: ""The proximity of the bomb to the gas pipeline clearly presented a significant risk but we were able to deal with the situation quickly. ""We safely removed the bomb from the pipeline area, and then carried out a controlled demolition. ""Fortunately the bomb turned out to be inert, meaning it wouldn't have posed a danger but there was no way of knowing this until we destroyed it."" Lieutenant Commander Charles Wheen, the Commanding Officer of HMS Cattistock, added: ""This is exactly the sort of task HMS Cattistock and the Royal Navy's expert divers are trained to do and we worked together to deliver a safe outcome. I'm very proud of the team involved and how they managed to resolve this potentially dangerous situation. ""It's a great example of the importance of good teamwork, but I hope it also serves as a reassuring demonstration of how the Royal Navy stands by around the clock to secure the seas around Britain."""

He had been in a medically induced coma after his health deteriorated, according to Italian media. He had reportedly been diagnosed with cancer. Riina was one of Sicily's most notorious Mafia bosses, and was nicknamed The Beast during his time in charge of the crime group Cosa Nostra. He was born to a poor farmer in Corleone in 1930. When he was 13, his father and seven-year-old brother were killed while trying to extract gunpowder from an unexploded American bomb. Riina killed his first victim when he was 19 in order to join his local Mafia ring. Starting on the bottom rung in the Mafia, Riina worked his way up from foot soldier to Luciano Leggio. In 1969, he was arrested and tried on several murder charges but freed because of jury intimidation. He went on the run in the same year - and after becoming the acting boss of the Corleone crime family, Riina went on to lead the entire Mafia while in hiding. Between 1981 and 1983 he sought to wipe out his rivals in Palermo, before cementing his rule by eliminating his allies too. The most high-profile murders he ordered were in 1992, when two anti-Mafia judges who had brought more than 300 mobsters to trial were assassinated. Among the most brutal killings was of a 13-year-old boy who was kidnapped to stop his father telling Mafia secrets. The teenager was strangled and dissolved in acid. Riina evaded capture while living in Sicily for more than two decades, even after he had been handed multiple life sentences when a fellow mobster turned state witness. Riina was captured in his own apartment in 1993, and sentenced to 26 life terms. He had even registered his four children under their own names in a local school without being caught. Riina asked to be released from prison in July on the grounds of poor health, but a judge said his care in the prisoners' wing of the hospital would be as good as on the outside. His daughter posted an image of a woman's mouth with a finger over her lips and the word ""shhh..."" after the news broke. A public funeral has been ruled out."

The parasites were removed from the soldier's ruptured small intestine, including what were thought to have been roundworms as long as 27cm. His name and rank have not been revealed but he is believed to be a staff sergeant aged in his mid-20s. At 5'6 tall but weighing 60kg, the soldier's state is thought to be indicative of the poor health among North Korea's troops. Lee Cook-jong, who leads the team treating the soldier, said: ""I spent more than 20 years of experience as a surgeon, but I have not found parasites this big in the intestines of South Koreans."" Experts have said that, because North Korea lacks chemical fertilisers, it uses human excrement to fertilise fields, helping parasites to spread. According to a 2014 study cited by the New York Times, South Korean doctors examined 17 female defectors from the North and found seven of them had parasitic worms. But more pressing were the serious injuries the soldier sustained from the shots fired at him as he tried to escape Kim Jong Un's regime on Monday. The soldier had tried to defect by driving into the Joint Security Area, a heavily guarded part of the Demilitarised Zone, where soldiers from the South and North watch each other just metres apart. He had then run across the border as four of his colleagues used handguns and AK rifles to fire about 40 rounds at him. He was hit five times. After collapsing just metres from his goal, he was pulled to safety by South Korean troops and taken to hospital by a US helicopter. He remains at the Ajou University Medical Center near Seoul, where he is on life support. He has had two surgeries but, while doctors said his vital signs are improving and no more surgeries are scheduled, it is too early to say whether he will recover fully."

But the Chancellor is not expected to take up the advice from his cabinet colleague Communities Secretary Sajid Javid to borrow Â£50bn to turbocharge home building. He told the Sunday Times: ""There will be some strategic measures that look 20, 30 years into the future to secure a strategic supply of future housing and there will be shorter term intervention measures which use money, powers and planning to intervene to get things done and make a difference over the next few years."" He is under considerable pressure from a number of different quarters: to lift the public sector wage cap, plug a funding crisis in the NHS, invest in schools and iron out issues with benefit changes. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told broadcasters what he would prioritise: ""I'd like to see a pause in the roll out of Universal Credit,"" he said. ""I would like to see sufficient money going into our NHS to deal with the existing crisis and proper funding of our schools as a priority, but also an agreement that we need to invest far more in the housing needs of the people of this country and therefore borrow to invest in housing."" The political pressure is also immense after the main revenue raisers in every budget since 2015 have had to be modified or abandoned. With the loss of the Government's majority, Mr Hammond will have to avoid any move which might be unpopular among his Conservative colleagues like changes to National Insurance which had to be abandoned after the last budget in March. With low productivity and concerns over Brexit he will be unwilling to borrow too heavily, or significantly increase taxes. But one backbencher Alec Shelbrooke, the MP for Elmet and Rothwell, has an idea to rake in some extra money: ending the freeze on fuel duty. ""Are you raising income tax? I think that hits people quite hard, it really does if you are putting a penny on the starting rate, I don't think that's the good way forward,"" he told Sky News. ""But in terms of petrol and diesel, (duty) has been frozen for a very long time. We've spent Â£38bn freezing it. I think spending priorities may have changed now."""
2017-11-18,Parliament's close procedural combat over Brexit has begun in earnest. All-night sittings and all-out battles between and within parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171119051752/https://news.sky.com/story/twin-tightropes-for-theresa-may-amid-mps-close-brexit-combat-11126950,"It began surreally enough, with Labour's backbench Brexiteer Frank Field arguing about the precise hour of Brexit. His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."

In a statement, AC/DC said: ""With enormous dedication and commitment he was the driving force behind the band. ""As a guitarist, songwriter and visionary he was a perfectionist and a unique man. He always stuck to his guns and did and said exactly what he wanted. ""He took great pride in all that he endeavoured. His loyalty to the fans was unsurpassed."" Angus Young, Malcolm's brother and fellow AC/DC co-founder, added: ""It is hard to express in words what he has meant to me during my life, the bond we had was unique and very special. ""He leaves behind an enormous legacy that will live on forever. ""Malcolm, job well done."" He is survived by his wife O'Linda, children Cara and Ross, son-in-law Josh, three grandchildren, sister and brother. Young died peacefully with his family by his side. The family will open a memorial page next week for messages of condolence and asked people to donate to The Salvation Army instead of sending flowers. Born in Scotland, one of eight children, Young and his family relocated to Australia when he was 10 and he grew up in Sydney. Young founded the band with his brother in 1973 until retired in 2014 for health reasons. They relocated to the UK in 1976, touring and recording heavily. He was absent briefly during 1988 while he overcame alcoholism, though this was covered at the time with other reasons from the band. #ACDC guitarist and co-founder #MalcolmYoung (64) died today. pic.twitter.com/yKhq961YQ3 The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. AC/DC recorded 17 studio albums and are perhaps best known for Highway To Hell, Back In Black and For Those About To Rock (We Salute You), released in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Despite Young's retirement in 2014, the band continued to tour and make new music. He was replaced by his nephew Stevie Young on the 2014 Rock Or Bust tour. Young's older brother George, a founding member of The Easybeats, died three weeks ago at the age of 70."
2017-11-18,An increasing number of towns and cities in the UK have been forced to raise money to pay for their own Christmas lights.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171119051752/https://news.sky.com/story/austerity-christmas-crowdfunding-festive-lights-11133623,"High Street illuminations are being crowdfunded by several communities who have been told their local council can no longer afford to meet the cost. England's National Association of Local Councils has acknowledged that town halls are starting to embrace the concept of crowdfunding as a means of paying for non-essential services. Its chief executive Jonathan Owen told Sky News: ""I think we're aware of several councils who are considering crowdfunding, for services that are discretionary services, not life or death services like adult care or education. ""The issue is that some of the larger councils across England are facing some real struggles (and) significant budget pressures. ""It's our councils, community councils, parish and town councils that have really stepped up and said, 'We can run some of these events that would otherwise probably not happen', and I think they do that because their residents want it and they can see the benefit of it to business and it boosts community cohesion."" The crowdfunded Christmas scenario is mirrored in parts of Scotland, too. Angus Council in the north-east of Scotland is one of a number of local authorities which isn't directly funding street lighting displays this year. It has prompted locals in the Angus town of Monifieth to launch festive fundraisers on social media to foot the bill themselves. Sheena Cochrane, chair of Monifieth Community Council, told Sky News: ""We began to realise that money is tight and we could do this ourselves - we could all come together as a community, it's a way of bringing everybody together, and taking ownership of our own lights and our own town centre instead of it just being the council that did it. ""So from something negative, it has really become something positive."" John Coventry, of the fundraising site GoFundMe, said it had seen a pre-Christmas growth in people crowdfunding. He told Sky News: ""It certainly seems to us that there has been an increase in activity around this area for raising money for local Christmas events and local lights over previous years. ""One of the big advantages of the internet, when it works best, is when it brings people together on their own terms to raise money and take action for stuff that they really care about."""
2017-11-18,Richard Leonard has been voted as the new leader of Scottish Labour as Kezia Dugdale enters the I'm A Celebrity jungle.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171119051752/https://news.sky.com/story/richard-leonard-voted-new-leader-of-scottish-labour-11131444,"Ms Dugdale resigned from leader of Scottish Labour at the end of August, sparking a new contest. Her decision to enter the ITV show has led to criticism, and Mr Leonard said the party would have to consider whether she should face suspension, though admitted it had not been his initial reaction. In his victory speech, Mr Leonard made references to recent sexual harassment and sleaze scandals, saying new training was needed. He said there would be an independent route for complaints as well as new training for staff and representatives on sexism and harassment. Mr Leonard has been an Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP) for just over a year, winning his seat in May 2016. He won the leadership contest by a sizeable margin, taking 9,150 votes - 51.8% of those cast. Mr Leonard is seen as an ally to Jeremy Corbyn. Although he supported him in the Labour leadership election, he did then distance himself in an interview, claiming he was ""too long in the tooth"" to be a Corbynista. He told his supporters: ""I joined the Labour Party in Stirling 35 years ago because I knew that the only way to bring about real change was to combine, to unite and to campaign in order to win power. ""The only party of hope and the only means of realising that hope, the hope of the people was the Labour Party. ""So to be elected leader of the Scottish Labour Party, to lead our party, as a movement for democracy and yes, as a movement for socialism, is a source of immense pride but it is also deeply humbling. ""Whoever you voted forâ¦ we are one party."" Mr Leonard's opposition was Anas Sarwar, who had previously been an acting leader for Scottish Labour. He took 43.3% of the vote. Mr Sarwar was a Glasgow MP in the 2010-2015 term but lost his seat to the SNP. Mr Corbyn congratulated the new leader, and said: ""After being written off time and again, the General Election showed that our party is capturing the mood both in Scotland and across the rest of the UK. ""There is much to do to continue our party's revival in Scotland and many who still need to be persuaded to put their trust in the Labour Party. ""But Richard's campaign offered a challenge to the rigged system that has benefited a wealthy elite and showed how he will lead Scottish Labour to transform society."" Of Mr Leonard, Sky's Tamara Cohen said: ""He is pretty new to Scottish politics. ""He was odds on favourite because of his closeness to Jeremy Corbyn. He was also a former union organiser. ""This contest has been very bitter, marred by personal attacks and accusations of vote rigging. ""People will be looking now to see if Labour can make much of a recovery in the coming years."" It is understood Ms Dugdale will be entering the ITV I'm A Celebrity jungle on Sunday alongside Boris Johnson's father Stanley. When she resigned, she wrote: ""I've given this task all that I have. ""With nearly four years until the next Scottish Parliament election, I'm convinced the party needs a new leader with fresh energy, drive and a new mandate to take the party into that contest."" Her decision to enter the jungle has come under fire from within her own party, as Jenny Marra said election to office was ""not a shortcut to celebrity"". Mr Leonard said: ""I awoke as many other people did this morning to the news that Kezia is going into that programme... I was a bit disappointed but I think it is a decision the group is going to have to consider."" Nadine Dorries was suspended from the Conservative Party when she appeared on the show in 2012 but was reinstated the following year. Mr Leonard becomes the fourth leader that Scottish Labour has had in three years."

Beside them in the photo are portraits of the British royal family's previously longest married couple, George III and Queen Charlotte, who were together for 57 years. The Queen is wearing a cream day dress by her in-house designer Angela Kelly, which she also wore at the Diamond Wedding Anniversary Service of Thanksgiving. The brooch she is wearing was given to her by Prince Philip in 1966. The photograph was taken early in November by British photographer Matt Holyoak from Camera Press. Camera Press was the agency that distributed the official wedding pictures back in 1947, taken by the photographer Baron, who would go on to be a close friend of Prince Philips. It was the first assignment for the new photo agency. Mr Holyoak is a well-known portrait photographer, who has taken pictures of many famous actors, designers, musicians, and athletes for some of the worlds top magazines. He said: ""I feel very honoured and privileged to have been asked to contribute to this very special occasion. ""My vision for the image was to capture an intimate and natural portrait of the Queen and Duke to celebrate their landmark anniversary. ""The Queen and the Duke were very happy and relaxed which made it a pleasure. I feel the images showcase their strength and unity"". The marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947 attracted worldwide attention and was a big moment of celebration for post-war Britain. On Monday, they will become the only British monarch and consort to have ever reached their platinum anniversary. Back in October, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Queen and Prince Philip would be marking the anniversary privately. It's understood they'll be hosting a party at Windsor Castle for close friends and family. Previously significant anniversaries have been celebrated with more fanfare. For their 60th wedding anniversary in 2007 official photographs were released and a service of thanksgiving was held at Westminster Abbey. To mark 50 years of marriage in 1997, the Queen and Prince Philip attended a lunch at Banqueting House in London. In a speech the Queen spoke of ""a remarkable 50 years"", and paid tribute to her husband. She said at the time: ""He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know."""

Plans to reverse the ban had prompted protests from conservationists who said it could deplete elephant populations, which are already at risk. US interior secretary Ryan Zinke said he and the US President had talked and ""both believe that conservation and healthy herds are critical"". Mr Trump tweeted: ""Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. ""Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!"" A US ban on elephant trophy imports had been introduced by the Obama administration in 2014. A number of celebrities voiced anger at Mr Trump's initial plan to reverse the policy, including Russell Crowe, Chelsea Clinton and Ricky Gervais who branded the move ""savage and pointless"". The fact that Trump has lifted President Obama's ban on elephant trophies being imported into the country is a devastating blow to the survival of these beautiful animals. It's savage and pointless. It breaks my heart. pic.twitter.com/iclfxN6TXr Some opponents had shared photos on social media of Mr Trump's sons Donald Jr and Eric posing with dead wild animals during a hunting trip. More than 12,500 elephant trophy items were imported into US between 2004 and 2014, almost 5,000 of which originated from Zimbabwe, according to the charity Born Free. The World Wildlife Fund said the African elephant population was now around 415,000, compared with as many as five million in the early part of the 20th century. The population plunged by around a fifth between 2006 and 2015 because of increased poaching for ivory, which is popular in China and other parts of Asia, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said."
2017-11-18,"Every year, about 100 million journeys begin and end at King's Cross Tube station.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171119051752/https://news.sky.com/story/fears-lessons-of-deadly-1987-kings-cross-fire-have-been-forgotten-11130364,"It is one of the busiest stations in Britain, a mass of people coming and going, and very few of them ever pause to look around them. To ponder their surroundings. But if they did, they might see a plaque on the wall, or a large handsome clock. Both there to commemorate the 31 people who died in this station exactly three decades ago. That night, a small fire started underneath the wooden escalator that took passengers up from the Piccadilly Line. A match had probably been dropped by a careless passenger as they lit a cigarette on the way out of the station - smoking had recently been banned, but the rule was often ignored and rarely enforced. But under the escalator were four decades-worth of grease mixed in with dust and discarded bits of paper. Lots of matches had been dropped over the years, only a few had taken light, and none had gone beyond a smoulder. But on this occasion, the fire took hold. The alarm was raised, and fire engine Alpha 24 took six minutes to arrive from its base in Soho. The men aboard found a moderate sized blaze, but few facilities in the station to help them. As they arranged their equipment, the fire suddenly exploded into life - rushing up the escalator, engulfing everyone and everything in its path. Among the dead were a senior firefighter and also a homeless man who was not identified for 16 years. Many more were injured and traumatised, and a period of national soul-searching began. The late 1980s were a grim time for disasters in Britain. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise, planes crashing at Kegworth and Manchester, a train smash in Clapham, football stadium disasters at Hillsborough and Bradford, the Piper Alpha fire in which 167 people died and the Lockerbie bombing. And yet somehow the King's Cross Fire seemed distinct and different, a disaster born of that most mundane of duties - commuting on the Tube. The public inquiry that followed, chaired by Desmond Fennell, was devastating. Over the course of 255 pages, it exposed huge failings in the way London Transport designed its stations and prepared for fires, as well as faults in the equipment given to emergency services. Senior managers, who had been characterised as lax and complacent, resigned. The Fennell Report did usher in a new era. Transport for London was created to replace the failing old companies and, when I spoke to TfL's managing director Mark Wild, he told me that the King's Cross Fire was ""the most pivotal event in the history of London Underground"". Paul Crowther, the Chief Constable of the British Transport Police, said the changes brought in after the fire were crucial. He said: ""The procedures for fire evacuations, the way emergency services worked together, communications and joint training - many of the good practises we see today came about as a direct result of King's Cross."" Mr Crowther remembers it well. He was a young police sergeant in 1987 and was put in charge of a temporary morgue near the station. ""I guess the things that stick with me are the smells, and the scenes of tired and exhausted firefighters sat down, sort of leaning against walls, taking a breather from the enormous effort that had gone in, together with police officers and ambulance crews, to try and save people at the scene."" These are scenes that are horribly familiar this year. Just five months ago, London's firefighters were tackling the inferno at Grenfell Tower, and now we await another public inquiry into a blaze that seems to have started with a small, innocuous blaze and ended up killing dozens. It is no easy matter to investigate fires. Three decades ago, it took months of cutting-edge research to work out how the King's Cross blaze grew so fast, and the man who led that project was a scientist called Ian Jones. Now retired, he fears that the lessons of King's Cross were, in part, forgotten. ""Grenfell was, I believe, a system failure,"" he said. ""The whole thing should have been looked at as a system, taking into account modifications made to the building of the tower and the maintenance of the facade. ""Many lessons (from King's Cross) were not applied to Grenfell."" Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the Grenfell Tower fire was so profoundly shocking to many people. For all the jokes about health and safety, maybe we had all kidded ourselves into thinking the world was now constructed on unshakeable, fail-safe foundations. It turns out that wasn't true. King's Cross station is now rebuilt and gleaming; the area around it has been regenerated at a cost of billions. An area that was, 30 years ago, seedy and menacing is now vibrant. It is an example that much of London has followed, with grimy districts reinvented to become aspirational and monied. But still there is that plaque, with the names of 31 people who died merely because they went to a Tube station, a reminder of a more careless, dangerous era for public safety. Like Grenfell Tower, King's Cross is a place that will always be linked to disaster."

The last time the Forestry Commission planted trees in England was in 2008 and, while Scotland has fared somewhat better, the last planting of new trees in Wales was in 1992. Some 780 ancient woodlands are under threat from new homes, transport projects, quarries and golf courses. Austin Brady from the Woodland Trust told Sky News: ""The Government have a laudable aspiration to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than they inherited it. ""The combination of poor planting rates, irreplaceable ancient woodland lost for projects like High Speed 2 but also 700 small individual cases of woodland being lost to planning applications right across the country.

Ships and aircraft have been scrambled to search for the vessel in the southern Argentine Sea, but the search efforts have been disrupted by a storm. Powerful winds and waves up to six metres (20ft) high have made exploration exceptionally difficult, according to Argentine navy spokesman Enrique Balbi. The Argentine navy anticipates the poor conditions to continue through to Sunday afternoon, according to a Reuters report. A spokesman for the British Navy said: ""Following a request from the Argentine government, HMS Protector has been deployed to join the search and rescue effort for the ARA San Juan."" An offer of help from an explorer aircraft belonging to the United States has also been accepted by Argentina. Sky News' Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said Britain also has an C-130 Hercules, which is stationed in the Falklands Islands, on standby if required. The ARA San Juan last gave its location two days ago and Mr Balbi has explained that the weather is complicating efforts, which are taking place both above and below the surface ""Detection has been difficult despite the quantity of boats and aircraft"" involved in the search, Mr Balbi said. He said the vessel may be suffering from a communications error. ""We are investigating the reasons for the lack of communication. If there was a communication problem, the boat would have to come to the surface,"" he added. The British government has offered help to the Argentine government in the search for its missing submarine. A C130 Hercules, currently stationed in the Falkland Islands, is on standby to assist if required. Mr Balbi said the submarine, which left the southern city of Ushuaia for Mar del Plata, more than 1,800 miles away, has food supply for several days and is likely to continue its journey despite the problem. According to national Argentinian newspaper La Nacion, the 66m (216ft) long, diesel-electric vessel was subjected to complex repair and engineering work in 2008, which the country's navy believed would extend its life by 30 years. It was built in Germany in 1985 and arrived in Argentina a year later. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri said the government was in contact with the crew's families. ""We share their concern and that of all Argentines,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""We are committed to using all national and international resources necessary to find the ARA San Juan submarine as soon as possible."" Pope Francis, who is from Argentina, has also offered his ""fervent prayers"" for the 44 crew members via a telegram to a senior bishop in the country. The Pope expressed his spiritual closeness to the families of the sailors, as well as the military and civil authorities in Argentina."

He is one of the world's longest-serving political leaders, having led the party for 34 years. ""Leadership means knowing when it's time for change, and that time is now,"" he told the conference which stood to applaud him. Stating his ""complete confidence in the next generation of leaders"" he said he supported holding a special conference in 2018 to elect the party's new president. :: Gerry Adams - the Belfast barman who became the face of Irish republicanism Describing the Peace Process as ""a great achievement"", Mr Adams said Irish republicanism had never been stronger. He spoke about challenges to human rights in Northern Ireland because of Brexit, and because of the deal between Theresa May and Sinn Fein's unionist opponents, the DUP. Mr Adams said Sinn Fein would be working towards a unity referendum to be held within the next five years. His announcement was preceded by a vote by party delegates to hold a special party conference within three months of the resignation of their leader. According to Sky's Ireland Correspondent David Blevins, the frontrunner to succeed Mr Adams is his serving deputy Mary Lou McDonald, who is 48 and a member of the Irish Parliament. ""She's much younger, and she doesn't come with the same baggage. In that sense she illustrates the journey that Sinn Fein continues to be on towards normalisation, moving away from its past as the political wing of the IRA and more firmly establishing itself within democratic politics."""
2017-11-18,Ireland's Prime Minister has told Sky News that Britain is asking for too much in its divorce talks with the European Union.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171119051752/https://news.sky.com/story/irish-pm-leo-varadkar-britain-asking-for-too-much-in-brexit-negotiations-11130604,"In a striking intervention, Leo Varadkar said the UK wants ""a divorce and an open relationship the day after"", which was a ""very difficult position to accept"". Mr Varadkar was speaking after Prime Minister Theresa May said not enough progress has been made to move the negotiations onto the second phase - Britain's future trading relationship with the bloc. For the talks to proceed, European leaders need to be of the view that ""sufficient progress"" has been made on three divorce issues - the exit bill, citizens' rights and the Irish border. Mr Varadkar struck a pessimistic note, telling Sky News that while he had a ""very good and constructive meeting"" with Mrs May at a summit in Sweden, ""I can't say in any honesty that it's close, either on the Irish issue or the financial settlement"". The Irish PM said he wanted there to be progress, but he told Sky's Lewis Goodall that more realism was needed from London. Mr Varadkar said: ""Ireland's trading relationship with Britain is enormous and of course we want to have a new trade arrangement. ""But we should never forget that Brexit is a British policy, it's one that Britain has imposed on the rest of Europe and it's causing enormous difficulties for all of Europe and Ireland in particular. ""To me it seems that after 40 years of marriage, most of them good, Britain now wants a divorce and wants an open relationship the day after. ""And that's a very difficult position to accept, but I'm sure we'll work something out."" When asked if he would be willing to veto moving the talks onto the next phase, Mr Varadkar said he was ""not in the business of threatening vetoes"", but did not explicitly rule it out. In separate remarks to journalists covering the summit, Mr Varadkar was much more forceful. He said: ""Before we move to phase two talks on trade, we want taken off the table any suggestion that there will be a physical border, a hard border, new barriers to trade on the island of Ireland. ""If we have to wait until the New Year, if we have to wait for further concessions, so be it."" Mr Varadkar added: ""It's 18 months since the referendum, it's 10 years since people who wanted a referendum started agitating for one. ""Sometimes it doesn't seem like they have thought all this through."" On the subject of the border, Mr Varadkar told Sky News ""it would be very difficult for us to accept anything other than a written commitment that the British government means what it says"". Earlier on Friday, Ireland's foreign minister said ""serious issues"" concerning the UK-Irish border after Brexit mean trade talks should be delayed and a five-year transition period implemented. Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary David Davis suggested he wanted to see compromise from Brussels, warning EU leaders in an interview that they will get ""nothing...for nothing"". When asked about Mr Davis' claim, European Council President Donald Tusk said: ""I can say only that I appreciate Mr Davis' English sense of humour."" Mr Tusk has set a deadline for the start of December for Britain to make progress on the divorce bill and the Irish border. Speaking after talks with Mrs May, he said Brussels has finished the internal work required to green light trade talks at the forthcoming European Council summit on 14-15 December. ""We will be ready to move on to the second phase already in December, but in order to do that we need to see more progress from the UK side,"" Mr Tusk said. ""While good progress on citizens' rights is being made, we need to see much more progress on Ireland and on the financial settlement."" Downing Street has dismissed reports suggesting Britain could be ready to offer another Â£20bn to Brussels to break the logjam on the exit bill."

The air crew have been grounded while an investigation is carried out. Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, the commander of Naval Air Forces, told Sky News: ""The Navy holds its aircrew to the highest standards and we find this absolutely unacceptable, of zero training value and we are holding the crew accountable. ""Sophomoric and immature antics of a sexual nature have no place in Naval aviation today. We will investigate this incident to get all the facts and act accordingly. ""This event clearly stands in stark contrast to the way our aviators and sailors are performing with utmost professionalism, discipline and excellence from our carrier flight decks and expeditionary airfields around the world today."" Images of the condensed air trail went viral on social media. A television station reported that a mother in Okanogan County was concerned she might have to explain the phallic symbol to her young children. There were others who appeared amused by the stunt. Resident Ramone Duran told the Spokesman Review: ""After it made circles at the bottom, I knew what it was and started laughing. ""It was pretty funny to see that."" Another onlooker tweeted that it was ""the most monumental thing to happen"" in their community."
2017-11-18,"A group of 90 MPs, including former Tory ministers, have written to the Prime Minister and Chancellor calling for urgent funding for the NHS and social care.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171119051752/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-in-cross-party-group-pile-pressure-on-pm-for-nhs-cash-injection-11131896,"The letter - signed by 33 Conservative MPs - piles pressure on the Government to ""address the short term pressures on the system"" in next week's Budget, in order to address public anxiety about services which are under ""considerable strain"". It also calls on Theresa May to set up an NHS and Care Convention, which would work across party political lines to come up with a ""sustainable"" system in the long-term. Philip Hammond already faces calls to lift the public sector pay cap and invest in a new programme of house-building in Wednesday's statement, against a backdrop of economic and political constraints. But the MPs express concerns that the issue of adult social care has been kicked into the long grass after the Conservatives' election manifesto pledge was branded a ""dementia tax"" and had to be dropped. The letter is co-ordinated by Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Commons Health Select Committee, Lib Dem former minister Norman Lamb and Labour MP Liz Kendall. It says: ""With the Budget coming up, we hope that the Government will seek to address the short-term pressure on the system. ""But we also repeat our call for you to endorse our proposal to establish a cross-party process in the form of an NHS and Care Convention in order to deliver a sustainable, long-term settlement... ""We believe that together we owe a duty to the people of this country to confront the serious challenges the NHS and care system now face. ""This would give hope both to the public and to staff working in the NHS and the social care system, many of whom have real anxieties about the future sustainability of public services."" NHS England has been lobbying for more money for hospitals, with boss Simon Stevens claiming an additional Â£4bn is needed to slash waiting lists for operations. Meanwhile, councils have been warning that seven years of cuts to their budgets have put adult care services under unbearable strain. The Government points out that it recently injected Â£2bn into social care. Dr Wollaston, who spoke to the Prime Minister in February about setting up a national convention on health and care, said progress had been stalled by the General Election but must resume in order to respond to the pressures of an ageing population. :: NHS faces a worse winter over failure to free up beds, says regulator The letter is signed by 15 committee chairs, 22 former minister, six former secretaries of state and prominent shadow ministers. Mr Hammond has a difficult balancing act, with pressure from some in his party to continue cutting the deficit and not to raise taxes, and other MPs saying he must be bold. Robert Halfon, the party's former deputy chairman, told the Financial Times: ""The Budget is the most important event since the election. ""It's a chance for the Government to be radical, to deal with the most important issues facing the country: skills, housing, cost of living, the NHS and social care. Safety first will be the wrong approach."""

Her decision to appear on the programme somewhat overshadowed the vote for her successor, which took place on Saturday, after she stood down in August. Richard Leonard was voted the new leader of the Scottish branch of the party and he quickly had to answer questions about whether Ms Dugdale would face suspension. He said he was ""a bit disappointed"" in her decision but admitted suspension hadn't been his first thought. He said: ""I awoke as many other people did this morning to the news that Kezia is going into that programme, and I think that is something the group is going to have to consider over the next few days and I think we will consider."" In 2012, Conservative MP Nadine Dorries was suspended from her party for choosing to enter the contest. She was reinstated the following year. Mr Leonard said: ""I don't know the circumstances of Nadine Dorries and I don't at this stage know all the circumstances of Kezia's decision, so we will need to give that due consideration at the group over the next few days."" But Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: ""It's her choice to go on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!, I don't think it's appropriate to suspend someone from the party for doing that, that's her choice."" Former Labour first minister Henry McLeish ""urged"" her to rethink her decision before she flies to Australia on Sunday. Jenny Marra, a fellow MSP, tweeted: ""Election to parliament is a privilege to serve and represent people. It's not a shortcut to celebrity."" Mr Leonard's leadership rival, Anas Sarwar, also criticised the decision, saying: ""She's made the decision she had. I would prefer that she was in the Parliament working for her constituents, working for the Labour Party. ""I want us focusing on education, the NHS, and employability, rather than kangaroo testicles."" He added that he would be calling in to ensure she ""eats every bug possible so she fully enjoys that experience"". Sky Bet have the MSP at 10-1 to win."

There has been an 80% reduction in plastic bag use since 2015 after shops were legally obliged to charge for their purchase. :: Nurseries ban glitter over pollution concerns Philip Hammond is expected to ""call for evidence"" next Wednesday from consumers, environmental groups and companies involved in the life cycle of plastic products to see whether taxes and charges could be used more widely. Over 300 million tonnes of plastic were produced in the UK alone in 2014 and that number is expected to double over the next 20 years. Tisha Brown from Greenpeace told Sky News: ""Taxation measures can help as we've seen with the plastic bag levy, which dramatically reduced the number of bags purchased and those ending up in the environment. ""We know that works and we're hoping that taxation measures on other items can reduce our plastic footprint,"" she added. :: Plastic pollution reaches ocean's deepest parts But the Taxpayers' Alliance pressure group has warned the Government against using taxation as a ""blunt instrument"". Research Director Alex Wild argues that businesses often correct their own behaviours without interference and that ""all too often governments use the tax system to correct every perceived ill they can think of"". The Scottish and Welsh parliaments are already using their devolved powers to try to limit single-use plastics. Cardiff may follow Edinburgh and start trialling a deposit return scheme next year, while Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign has helped maintain the political pressure. :: Shocking photos emerge of 'sea of plastic' Government advisers say they want to look at what can be done to decrease use, increase recycling and force businesses to innovate in the materials they use for packaging. They insist the aim is for Britain to become a world leader in green technologies, but argue levies - if used judiciously - can help alter behaviours without adding costs to business. :: Sky has been running a campaign to make people more aware of the effect plastic has on the world's oceans and to share ways of tackling the problem.

2017-11-18,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171119051752/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

2017-11-18,Gerry Adams has announced he will stand down as member of the Irish Parliament and Sinn Fein party leader next year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171119051752/https://news.sky.com/story/gerry-adams-the-belfast-barman-who-became-the-face-of-irish-republicanism-11131338,"Sky News looks back at the career of the world's most recognisable Irish Republican. Gerry Adams' journey began in a Belfast pub with the most British of names above the door. He was a barman in The Duke of York, where whispered conversations between lawyers and journalists in the 1970s fuelled his fascination with politics. Having grown up in a staunchly Republican west Belfast family, he became a political activist and was imprisoned without trial under the Special Powers Act. He has long denied IRA membership but was temporarily released at the terror group's request to attend secret talks with the British government in 1972. Within days of those talks, which had failed to produce a ceasefire, 11 people died when 21 bombs exploded in one day, Belfast's ""Bloody Friday"". Interviewed some 30 years later, after the Provisionals had apologised for the attacks, Gerry Adams strenuously denied having been the IRA commander who sanctioned them. Acquitted of IRA membership in 1977, he became a household name in 1983 - elected Member of Parliament for West Belfast and Sinn Fein President. Margaret Thatcher banned his voice from the airwaves but he remained in the news. Often pictured carrying IRA coffins, he himself survived two assassination attempts. Brought in from the cold by John Hume, then leader of the nationalist SDLP, Gerry Adams led Sinn Fein to the negotiating table at Stormont. In time, he persuaded the IRA to call a ceasefire, pursue a political settlement in the form of the Good Friday Agreement and decommission weapons. When the DUP and Sinn Fein became the largest parties, he nominated his life-long friend Martin McGuinness to share power with the Rev Ian Paisley. Refusing to swear an oath to the Queen - he refers to her as ""Mrs Windsor"" - he eventually swapped his Westminster seat for one in Dublin. But the past continued to haunt Gerry Adams and in 2014, he was arrested by detectives investigating the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in 1972. The body of the widowed mother-of-10, one of the so-called ""Disappeared"", had finally been located and recovered from an isolated beach in the Irish Republic. The Sinn Fein leader insisted he was ""totally innocent"" in relation to Mrs McConville's murder and was released without charge after four days of questioning. More recently, he has been dealing with Brexit, Sinn Fein's best-ever result at Stormont, the collapse of power-sharing and death of Martin McGuinness. Earlier this year, Gerry Adams told Sky News he would be prepared to talk about his past if an independent truth commission was set up. To some, he will always be a ""godfather"" figure, alleged to have ""blood on his hands"", but others prefer to talk about his historic handshakes. President Clinton reached out to him first, then prime minister Tony Blair, but no one had ever imagined he would shake hands with Prince Charles. Back in the company of a British Duke, the Belfast barman and face of Irish Republicanism had become the longest-serving political leader in these islands."

Mr Green was flying the two-seater helicopter involved in the crash. Captain Phil Croucher, his friend, told Sky News: ""I have known him for 20 odd years. We were both in the Army, we worked together. ""He was an ultra nice chap, very professional, would go out of his way to help people get on in their careers. ""He will be fondly remembered by everyone who knew him."" The mid-air collision happened just after 12pm on Friday. Police confirmed on Saturday afternoon that all four victims were men and they were working to recover all the bodies from the scene. The families of the four men have been told of their deaths and three of the families visited the site with family liaison officers. Investigations at the scene are expected to continue through the weekend and into Monday as detectives work out what happened in mid-air to cause the collision. Both aircraft came from Wycombe Air Park, also known as Booker Airfield, which offers flight training. The plane that crashed was a Cessna 152, which has the capacity for one pilot and one passenger. Waddesdon Manor said in a statement: ""Lord Rothschild and his family extend their condolences to the families of all affected, and their thanks to the emergency services for their swift response and professionalism."" On Saturday, investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) were seen carrying bags of debris in clear plastic bags. Fire investigators and police remained at the scene, with a cordon in place. The estate is around 6,000 acres, but police have not confirmed how wide an area they are investigating. A woman who was walking her dogs at the time of the collision said she heard a helicopter circling overhead ""and then heard sirens"" and smelled smoke. Waddesdon Estate gardener, Len Bellis, had been working nearby when he heard a ""horrendous noise"" before finding the ""burning wreckage"". Mr Bellis said the aircraft was a ""wreck"" and ""non-existent"", apart from the burning fuselage. A police cordon is in place outside the entrance to the Waddesdon estate."

The woman was taken to hospital as a precaution after she suffered minor injuries. The mishap follows the Â£25m aircraft's first flight in May after it crashed in August last year. During that incident, in which no one was injured, the 50ft-long aircraft nose-dived and crashed, severely damaging its cockpit. Manufacturer Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) is set to launch an investigation into why the aircraft, which is the length of a football pitch, broke free but said its hull was designed to rip open and deflate in the event of coming loose. In a statement, it said: ""The aircraft was not flying at the time of the incident. Our initial assessment is that the aircraft broke free from its mooring mast for reasons that will be investigated. ""The aircraft has a safety system which operates automatically in circumstances of the aircraft breaking free of its mast, and is designed to rip open the hull and deflate the aircraft.

Mr Green was flying the two-seater helicopter involved in the crash. Captain Phil Croucher, his friend, told Sky News: ""I have known him for 20 odd years. We were both in the Army, we worked together. ""He was an ultra nice chap, very professional, would go out of his way to help people get on in their careers. ""He will be fondly remembered by everyone who knew him."" The mid-air collision happened just after 12pm on Friday. Police confirmed on Saturday afternoon that all four victims were men and they were working to recover all the bodies from the scene. The families of the four men have been told of their deaths and three of the families visited the site with family liaison officers. Investigations at the scene are expected to continue through the weekend and into Monday as detectives work out what happened in mid-air to cause the collision. Both aircraft came from Wycombe Air Park, also known as Booker Airfield, which offers flight training. The plane that crashed was a Cessna 152, which has the capacity for one pilot and one passenger. Waddesdon Manor said in a statement: ""Lord Rothschild and his family extend their condolences to the families of all affected, and their thanks to the emergency services for their swift response and professionalism."" On Saturday, investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) were seen carrying bags of debris in clear plastic bags. Fire investigators and police remained at the scene, with a cordon in place. The estate is around 6,000 acres, but police have not confirmed how wide an area they are investigating. A woman who was walking her dogs at the time of the collision said she heard a helicopter circling overhead ""and then heard sirens"" and smelled smoke. Waddesdon Estate gardener, Len Bellis, had been working nearby when he heard a ""horrendous noise"" before finding the ""burning wreckage"". Mr Bellis said the aircraft was a ""wreck"" and ""non-existent"", apart from the burning fuselage. A police cordon is in place outside the entrance to the Waddesdon estate."

It also calls on Theresa May to set up an NHS and Care Convention, which would work across party political lines to come up with a ""sustainable"" system in the long-term. Philip Hammond already faces calls to lift the public sector pay cap and invest in a new programme of house-building in Wednesday's statement, against a backdrop of economic and political constraints. But the MPs express concerns that the issue of adult social care has been kicked into the long grass after the Conservatives' election manifesto pledge was branded a ""dementia tax"" and had to be dropped. The letter is co-ordinated by Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Commons Health Select Committee, Lib Dem former minister Norman Lamb and Labour MP Liz Kendall. It says: ""With the Budget coming up, we hope that the Government will seek to address the short-term pressure on the system. ""But we also repeat our call for you to endorse our proposal to establish a cross-party process in the form of an NHS and Care Convention in order to deliver a sustainable, long-term settlement... ""We believe that together we owe a duty to the people of this country to confront the serious challenges the NHS and care system now face. ""This would give hope both to the public and to staff working in the NHS and the social care system, many of whom have real anxieties about the future sustainability of public services."" NHS England has been lobbying for more money for hospitals, with boss Simon Stevens claiming an additional Â£4bn is needed to slash waiting lists for operations. Meanwhile, councils have been warning that seven years of cuts to their budgets have put adult care services under unbearable strain. The Government points out that it recently injected Â£2bn into social care. Dr Wollaston, who spoke to the Prime Minister in February about setting up a national convention on health and care, said progress had been stalled by the General Election but must resume in order to respond to the pressures of an ageing population. :: NHS faces a worse winter over failure to free up beds, says regulator The letter is signed by 15 committee chairs, 22 former minister, six former secretaries of state and prominent shadow ministers. Mr Hammond has a difficult balancing act, with pressure from some in his party to continue cutting the deficit and not to raise taxes, and other MPs saying he must be bold. Robert Halfon, the party's former deputy chairman, told the Financial Times: ""The Budget is the most important event since the election. ""It's a chance for the Government to be radical, to deal with the most important issues facing the country: skills, housing, cost of living, the NHS and social care. Safety first will be the wrong approach."""

He is one of the world's longest-serving political leaders, having led the party for 34 years. ""Leadership means knowing when it's time for change, and that time is now,"" he told the conference which stood to applaud him. Stating his ""complete confidence in the next generation of leaders"" he said he supported holding a special conference in 2018 to elect the party's new president. :: Gerry Adams - the Belfast barman who became the face of Irish republicanism Describing the Peace Process as ""a great achievement"", Mr Adams said Irish republicanism had never been stronger. He spoke about challenges to human rights in Northern Ireland because of Brexit, and because of the deal between Theresa May and Sinn Fein's unionist opponents, the DUP. Mr Adams said Sinn Fein would be working towards a unity referendum to be held within the next five years. His announcement was preceded by a vote by party delegates to hold a special party conference within three months of the resignation of their leader. According to Sky's Ireland Correspondent David Blevins, the frontrunner to succeed Mr Adams is his serving deputy Mary Lou McDonald, who is 48 and a member of the Irish Parliament. ""She's much younger, and she doesn't come with the same baggage. In that sense she illustrates the journey that Sinn Fein continues to be on towards normalisation, moving away from its past as the political wing of the IRA and more firmly establishing itself within democratic politics."""

But after four weeks of negotiations, FDP leader Christian Lindner walked out of the discussions, saying there was no ""basis of trust"" to forge a government with Mrs Merkel's conservative bloc and the Greens. ""It is better not to govern than to govern badly,"" he said, adding that the parties did not share ""a common vision on modernising"" Germany. Mrs Merkel emerged from the talks looking weary but vowed to steer Germany through the crisis. She said she would stay on as acting Chancellor and would consult with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on how to move forward, adding that a deal had been within reach. ""It is a day of deep reflection on how to go forward in Germany,"" she said. ""As Chancellor, I will do everything to ensure that this country is well managed in the difficult weeks to come."" Mrs Merkel was weakened after the September election as voters angry with her decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to more than a million asylum seekers punished her party by voting for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right party. The breakdown of the talks seemingly leaves Germany with two options: Mrs Merkel forms a minority government, or President Steinmeier calls a new election if no government is formed. The key sticking points of the negotiations were the issues of migration and climate change. Among other things the Greens were pushing for Germany to end its use of coal and combustion engines by 2030, although they had signalled they were open to some compromise. The other parties are also committed to reducing carbon emissions, but Mrs Merkel's bloc had not put a date on when to phase out coal. The FDP expressed concern about what the moves would mean for jobs and Germany's economic competitiveness. On migration, the Christian Social Union was pushing for an annual cap on refugees, while the Greens wanted to allow more categories of recent migrants to bring their closest relatives to join them."
2017-11-19,An increasing number of towns and cities in the UK have been forced to raise money to pay for their own Christmas lights.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171120053029/https://news.sky.com/story/austerity-christmas-crowdfunding-festive-lights-11133623,"High Street illuminations are being crowdfunded by several communities who have been told their local council can no longer afford to meet the cost. England's National Association of Local Councils has acknowledged that town halls are starting to embrace the concept of crowdfunding as a means of paying for non-essential services. Its chief executive Jonathan Owen told Sky News: ""I think we're aware of several councils who are considering crowdfunding, for services that are discretionary services, not life or death services like adult care or education. ""The issue is that some of the larger councils across England are facing some real struggles (and) significant budget pressures. ""It's our councils, community councils, parish and town councils that have really stepped up and said, 'We can run some of these events that would otherwise probably not happen', and I think they do that because their residents want it and they can see the benefit of it to business and it boosts community cohesion."" The crowdfunded Christmas scenario is mirrored in parts of Scotland, too. Angus Council in the north-east of Scotland is one of a number of local authorities which isn't directly funding street lighting displays this year. It has prompted locals in the Angus town of Monifieth to launch festive fundraisers on social media to foot the bill themselves. Sheena Cochrane, chair of Monifieth Community Council, told Sky News: ""We began to realise that money is tight and we could do this ourselves - we could all come together as a community, it's a way of bringing everybody together, and taking ownership of our own lights and our own town centre instead of it just being the council that did it. ""So from something negative, it has really become something positive."" John Coventry, of the fundraising site GoFundMe, said it had seen a pre-Christmas growth in people crowdfunding. He told Sky News: ""It certainly seems to us that there has been an increase in activity around this area for raising money for local Christmas events and local lights over previous years. ""One of the big advantages of the internet, when it works best, is when it brings people together on their own terms to raise money and take action for stuff that they really care about."""

He defied Zanu-PF and thousands of protesters by pledging to preside over the party's next congress in December after he was told he had until noon local time on Monday to step down as president or face impeachment proceedings as early as Tuesday. Mr Mugabe acknowledged ""a range of concerns"" in his speech but made no mention of his own position following an apparent coup by the army earlier in the week. He said the events of the last few days were not a threat to the constitution or his authority as head of state. He said recent developments within Zanu-PF were ""understandable"" but said it could not be guided by ""bitterness"". The 93-year-old told viewers we must ""learn to forgive"". He said: ""Whatever the pros and cons of how they (the army) went about their operation, I do acknowledge their concerns. ""We must learn to forgive and resolve contradictions, real or perceived, in a comradely Zimbabwean spirit."" He added: ""The Government remains committed to improving the social and material conditions of the people."" Chris Mustvangwa, the leader of Zimbabwe's war veterans, said plans for impeachment would still go ahead and said protesters planned to take to the streets of Harare on Wednesday. Zanu-PF's chief whip Lovemore Matuke also said Mr Mugabe's impeachment would still go ahead. He said: ""The Central Committee decision stands until I am advised otherwise."" Reacting to the speech on Sky News, Mr Mustvangwa said Mr Mugabe was ""blind to what the people of Zimbabwe were saying to him"". Zimbabwe's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he was ""baffled"" by address amid the growing pressure for the president to stand down. Sky News' Senior Correspondent David Bowden said the situation was a ""mess"". Reacting to the TV address, he said: ""It was an extraordinary ramble by an old man who seems to have just blazed on through... there was no hint of resignation. It was extraordinary and completely at odds with reality."" The speech follows Zanu-PF's former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa being appointed as the new leader of the party. And Mr Mugabe's wife Grace, who is hugely unpopular in the country, is being expelled by Zanu-PF. Reacting to Mr Mugabe's dismissal as party leader earlier in the day, his son Chatunga Bellarmine Mugabe insisted ""you can't fire a revolutionary leader"" and said Zanu-PF was ""nothing"" without his dad. He wrote on Facebook: ""Gushungo will always remain the champion of champions! Proud of you Gushungo, proud of dad. Gushungo always and forever to death."""

2017-11-19,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171120053029/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"
2017-11-19,The parents of a stillborn baby have released a picture of their son to help highlight new research that shows pregnant women can halve the risk of stillbirth simply by going to sleep in the correct position.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171120053029/https://news.sky.com/story/stillbirth-breakthrough-women-urged-to-sleep-on-side-11135157,"Hayley and Adam Powsney, from Bury, Greater Manchester, hope that the image of baby Joshua will help draw attention to the findings and underline the heartache that stillbirth brings. ""He died in the delivery process,"" Mrs Powsney told Sky News. ""That changes you completely as a person."" She added: ""From the moment they told me there was nothing more they could do my world just collapsed. I had my baby in my arms and he didn't cry. There's nothing that can prepare you for that."" In the largest study to examine maternal sleep and stillbirth, scientists assessed more than 1,000 pregnant women. Stillbirth is 15 times more common than cot death and Britain has one of the worst records in the developed world. Researchers say the results of the latest study could potentially save 100,000 babies a year if the risk was eliminated internationally. The work was carried out by Tommy's Stillbirth Research Centre in Manchester. The centre's clinical director, Professor Alex Heazell, said: ""Around 11 babies are stillborn every day in the UK. ""Stillbirth is devastating with long-lasting effects on bereaved parents. Parents want to know why their baby has died, whether it might happen again if they try for another baby and what they can do to avoid further stillbirth."" A public health campaign has been launched to accompany the publication of the results. The ""Sleep on Side"" campaign aims to educate women about the risk of going to sleep on their back in late pregnancy. It includes a video showing how a mother-to-be should lie when nodding off. The advice applies to sleep in the third trimester (after 28 weeks) including: :: Going to sleep at night:: Returning to sleep after night awakenings:: Daytime naps As the going-to-sleep position is the one held longest during the night, women shouldn't be worried if they wake up on their back but should simply roll over onto their side. Although researchers can't say for certain why the risk is increased, there are several theories. In the third trimester, when the woman is lying on her back, the combined weight of baby and uterus (womb) puts pressure on the main blood vessels that supply the uterus, and this can restrict blood flow/oxygen to the baby. Other possible explanations include disturbed breathing during sleep, which is worse when a woman sleeps on her back and in overweight or obese women, who also have an increased risk of stillbirth. The advice is being supported by the Powsneys, who went on to have two healthy babies. ""We want Joshua's life to mean something,"" said Mr Powsney. ""Our oldest child is now two-and-a-half. We're going to explain to her that she had an older brother. If we can help Tommy's Research Centre his life will mean something."""

Speaking to Sky News' Niall Paterson about the potential for a ""no deal"" Brexit, Mr Hammond said: ""We have to make provision for it and accept it is a possibility. ""And we have to accept, actually, by putting this date on the front of the bill, unfortunately you've made that more likely."" Mr Hammond, who supported Remain last year, said leaving the EU without an exit agreement would be an ""economic catastrophe"". The Government's amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill aims to declare 11pm on 29 March 2019 as the official moment the UK leaves the EU. Meanwhile, in another sign of deepening Conservative divisions, former attorney-general Dominic Grieve - who also opposes the Government's plan - was scathing of some of his fellow Tory MPs' approach to Brexit. ""I do sometimes think that some of my colleagues have become unhinged, actually - not the Prime Minister,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""The Prime Minister's problem is that she's surrounded by people who get louder and more strident by the moment as some of the inevitable problems, which were going to come with Brexit, start to make themselves apparent."" However, despite previous signals the Government might retreat on the proposal to enshrine the Brexit date in UK legislation, Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested there might not be any movement despite backbench anger. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he insisted ministers ""have no plans to change what we're putting before Parliament"". Ahead of his Budget on Wednesday, the Chancellor suggested Britain was nearing a ""turning point"" and about to make ""serious movement forward"" in Brexit talks. He revealed the UK would ""make proposals"" to the EU on its financial settlement before a key Brussels summit next month. ""It's not about demands, it's about what is properly due from the UK to the EU under international law in accordance with the European treaties,"" he said. ""We have always been clear it won't be easy to work out that number, but whatever is due we will pay, we are a nation that honours our debts. ""Of course we will negotiate hard whether there is any question, any doubt about whether an item is payable or not."" Andy Burnham, Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, told Sky News that Westminster ""looks increasingly dysfunctional"" as MPs attempt to deal with Brexit. The former Cabinet minister, who left Parliament earlier this year to take up his mayoralty, voiced fears of a ""London-centric"" approach to Britain's departure from the EU to the detriment of regions and industries outside the capital. Demanding a ""seat at the table"" during the UK's negotiations with the EU, Mr Burnham called for further devolution as a response to Brexit. ""On many you can see how Westminster hasn't come up with the solutions the North of England needs,"" he said. ""Now with Brexit looming, finding solutions to those issues has become urgent."""
2017-11-19,New photographs of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been released to mark their 70th wedding anniversary.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171120053029/https://news.sky.com/story/new-photograph-celebrates-queen-and-prince-philips-70th-wedding-anniversary-11133146,"Three images were published on Sunday night, including one where Her Majesty is sitting in a gold-coloured chair, with Prince Philip standing alongside her. Two of the other new photos are of the couple standing next to each other. The Queen is wearing a cream day dress by her in-house designer Angela Kelly, which she also wore at the Diamond Wedding Anniversary Service of Thanksgiving. The brooch she is wearing was given to her by Prince Philip in 1966. The images show the Queen and the Duke against a platinum-textured backdrop, in recognition of the special milestone. The portrait released on Saturday shows the royals in the white drawing room at Windsor Castle. Beside them are portraits of the British royal family's previously longest married couple, George III and Queen Charlotte, who were together for 57 years. All of the pictures were taken early in November by British photographer Matt Holyoak from Camera Press. Camera Press was the agency that distributed the official wedding pictures back in 1947, taken by the photographer Baron, who would go on to be a close friend of Prince Philip's. It was the first assignment for the new photo agency. Mr Holyoak is a well-known portrait photographer, who has taken pictures of many famous actors, designers, musicians, and athletes for some of the worlds top magazines. He said: ""I feel very honoured and privileged to have been asked to contribute to this very special occasion. ""My vision for the image was to capture an intimate and natural portrait of the Queen and Duke to celebrate their landmark anniversary. ""The Queen and the Duke were very happy and relaxed which made it a pleasure. I feel the images showcase their strength and unity,"" said Mr Holyoak. The marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947 attracted worldwide attention and was a big moment of celebration for post-war Britain. On Monday, they will become the only British monarch and consort to have ever reached their platinum anniversary. Back in October, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Queen and Prince Philip would be marking the anniversary privately. It's understood they'll be hosting a party at Windsor Castle for close friends and family. Previously significant anniversaries have been celebrated with more fanfare. For their 60th wedding anniversary in 2007 official photographs were released and a service of thanksgiving was held at Westminster Abbey. To mark 50 years of marriage in 1997, the Queen and Prince Philip attended a lunch at Banqueting House in London. In a speech the Queen spoke of ""a remarkable 50 years"", and paid tribute to her husband. She said at the time: ""He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know."""

However, Admiral Gabriel Gonzalez, chief of the Mar del Plata Naval Base, said the navy did ""not have clear evidence"" that the calls ""have come from that unit"". ""We are analysing more closely to reliably determine that they were not calls coming from the submarine,"" the admiral added. The UK, US, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay have joined the search operation for the submarine, which disappeared 268 miles off Argentina's southern Atlantic coast on Wednesday. Claudio Rodriguez, whose brother Hernan is on board the submarine, said the satellite signals suggested the vessel was still afloat and would be found. ""They've got to be afloat. Thank God,"" he said. ""That gives us hope, because we knew that if they were down below, they would be screwed."" A spokesman for Argentina's defence ministry said it was ""working to pinpoint the exact location of what is emitting the signals"". It is thought the vessel, which has food and oxygen supplies for several days, may be suffering from a communications error. The Royal Navy has deployed HMS Protector, an ice patrol ship, to help in the search. Sky's Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said Britain also has a C-130 Hercules, which is stationed in the Falklands Islands, on standby if required. A second US Navy aircraft has joined the search, while two underwater crafts designed to rescue trapped submarine sailors at different depths are being deployed. A remotely operated underwater robot known as an ROV is also being used. Argentinian President Mauricio Macri wrote on Twitter: ""We will do what is necessary to find the submarine as soon as possible."" Relatives of the missing sailors have gathered at a naval base in Mar del Plata, where the submarine had been destined to arrive before vanishing, awaiting news. Maria Morales, the mother of one crew member told journalists, told reporters: ""We're hopeful this will end soon to remain only as a bad memory."""

His said the country must ""embrace change"" with new technologies or risk ""slipping behind"". But a series of interviews to preview his plans were overshadowed when he appeared to dismiss the 1.4 million jobless people in the UK. Mr Hammond described to Andrew Marr on the BBC how two decades ago ""we were worrying what was happening to the one million shorthand typists as the personal computer took over"". He added: ""Well nobody has a shorthand typist these days but where are all these unemployed people? There are no unemployed people. ""We have created 3.5 million new jobs since 2010. This economy has become a jobs factory, constantly reinventing itself, constantly creating new jobs and careers."" The Chancellor later corrected himself. He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""Of course I didn't mean that. There's 1.4 million unemployed people in this country and that's 1.4 million too many. ""But we have record low levels of unemployment, it hasn't been this low since the 1970s. ""But the point I was makingâ¦ is that previous waves of technological change have not resulted in millions of people being long-term unemployed. ""They have been re-absorbed into the workforce."" Mr Hammond's political opponents seized on his comments. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News: ""The most revealing thing we've heard from the Chancellor this morning is that he doesn't think there's any unemployed people in this country. ""What world is he living in?"" And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""As Chancellor Philip Hammond needs to be on top of the numbers, and as he should know very well, there are actually 1.425 million people unemployed. ""Worse, a large number of them are second or third generation out of work, suggesting that all that a large number of people are inheriting in Britain today is poverty. ""It underlines just how out of touch the Conservatives are with millions of Britons who are living on the breadline. ""Philip Hammond is right that we should embrace automation, but we should also be mindful that it can also put people out of work in the short term."" Meanwhile, Mr Hammond will also use Wednesday's Budget to commit the Government to delivering 300,000 new homes every year in a bid to increase the supply of housing."

2017-11-19,"Philip Hammond will unveil his Budget on Wednesday and, as usual, there have been briefings, rumours and ministerial wrangling ahead of the Chancellor's set-piece occasion.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171120053029/https://news.sky.com/story/budget-2017-what-do-we-know-of-philip-hammonds-plans-so-far-11134461,"So, what plans are expected to be within Mr Hammond's Red Box later this week? HOUSING: The Chancellor will pledge to build 300,000 homes per year, with the Treasury reportedly ready to find Â£5bn for housing schemes while tens of billions more could be earmarked for underwriting loans. An inquiry into so-called ""land-banking"" by developers is also expected to lead a list of measures to try and boost Britain's housing supply, along with an attempt to reinvigorate small and medium-sized builders. However, Mr Hammond has warned there is ""no single magic bullet"" and cautioned against ""pouring money"" into housebuilding. :: Gaffe overshadows Hammond Budget interviews This suggests the Treasury has resisted pleas by Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid to borrow a reported Â£50bn to fund a major new Government housing programme. The Chancellor has also indicated he won't ease protections on greenbelt land, although he has been coy on rumours stamp duty for first-time buyers could be cut in order to help young people onto the housing ladder. NHS: Mr Hammond has promised to address ""particular pressure points"" but appears ready to reject lobbying by NHS England boss Simon Stevens, who has claimed Â£4bn extra is needed for hospitals next year. The Chancellor has pointed to the Government's existing commitment to meet previous NHS demands for Â£10bn extra by 2020, while he suggested ""Armageddon"" will not arrive if more cash isn't handed over. PUBLIC SECTOR PAY: Mr Hammond has confirmed the blanket 1% cap on annual rises for public sector pay has been lifted. And nurses are expected to be Budget Day beneficiaries with the Chancellor reportedly ready to announce new funds to boost their pay. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding an inflation-busting hike of 3.9% and has warned it must not be funded out of existing NHS budgets. UNIVERSAL CREDIT: Amid mounting pressure from Tory backbenchers and Labour, the Government has done little to dampen expectations the growing criticism of flagship benefit changes could be dealt with at the Budget. Sky News has been told the controversial six-week wait for Universal Credit payments will be cut to five weeks or less in a significant concession to potential Conservative rebels. VAT: Small businesses have been left worried by suggestions the Chancellor could lower the threshold at which they are required to charge VAT. Firms are currently liable to charge VAT once their annual turnover reaches Â£85,000, but the Office for Tax Simplification has recommended reviewing the threshold. Lowering it to Â£20,000 would bring it in line with the EU average and raise extra funds for the Treasury, but could prove politically unpopular as it would impact self-employed builders, decorators and B&B owners. FUEL DUTY: Diesel drivers will be fearful of suggestions the Chancellor could introduce a fuel duty rise on diesel but continue a freeze on petrol as part of Government efforts to tackle air pollution. NEW TECHNOLOGY: Mr Hammond is expected to boost high-tech industry by paving the way for driverless cars on British roads by 2021, as well as announcing new investment in robotics, clean fuel technology and 5G phones. PLASTICS: The Budget will be used to launch a consultation into whether taxes could be used to limit the use of plastic packaging such as bottles, bubble wrap and plastic packaging."

Officers said the man was found to have 53 phones in his possession which are believed to have been stolen during a concert by the rock duo at The Arena Birmingham on Saturday night. Police are now encouraging the band's fans who had their phones stolen to contact them. Detective Sergeant Jeff Clifford said: ""Currently the vast majority of victims have been identified, but we urge anyone who attended the concert who is missing a phone to call 101. Log 671 19/11/17 being used to record new reports. He added: ""It's an unfortunate reality that large crowds at concerts such as this make rich pickings for career criminals.

2017-11-19,Parliament's close procedural combat over Brexit has begun in earnest. All-night sittings and all-out battles between and within parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171120053029/https://news.sky.com/story/twin-tightropes-for-theresa-may-amid-mps-close-brexit-combat-11126950,"It began surreally enough, with Labour's backbench Brexiteer Frank Field arguing about the precise hour of Brexit. His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."
2017-11-19,Actor Jeffrey Tambor is considering quitting the Amazon series Transparent following two sexual harassment allegations made against him.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171120053029/https://news.sky.com/story/transparent-star-jeffrey-tambor-may-quit-amazon-show-11135140,"In an ambiguous statement that implies, although does not confirm, an imminent departure from the Emmy-winning series, Tambor referenced what he calls a ""politicised atmosphere that seems to have afflicted our set"". Transparent co-star Trace Lysette and a former assistant to Tambor have both come forward in recent weeks to accuse the show's frontman of sexual harassment. Transgender actress Lysette, who plays yoga instructor Shea, has alleged that Tambor made sexual remarks during filming and at one point thrust himself against her. Tambor, 73, has repeatedly denied the allegations, which are both under investigation by Amazon Studios. ""Playing Maura Pfefferman on Transparent has been one of the greatest privileges and creative experiences of my life,"" Tambor said in a statement. ""I've already made clear my deep regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being aggressive, but the idea that I would deliberately harass anyone is simply and utterly untrue. ""Given the politicised atmosphere that seems to have afflicted our set, I don't see how I can return to Transparent."" It is believed Tambor is yet to make a final decision as to whether he will return to the fifth season. Transparent has been lauded for its portrayal of a family who discovers that the person they had known as their father is transgender. The groundbreaking comedy series has scooped eight Emmys and two Golden Globes, including one for Tambor's acting. The allegations made against Tambor have put the show's future in jeopardy. Should Tambor part ways with Transparent, it would be the latest professional casualty of the anti-sexual harassment movement that is upending Hollywood. Over the past few weeks, Kevin Spacey was fired from House Of Cards and Louis CK had a Netflix stand-up special show axed."

The retired solicitor, from Bristol, was helping to change a sail when he fell into the Southern Ocean during rough conditions on Saturday, organisers said. He is the third Briton to die competing in the event in the last two years. Clipper Ventures, the firm behind the race, said Mr Speirs was clipped on to his team's 70ft long yacht with a safety tether but ""became separated"". He was brought back on board by the boat's crew 36 minutes later and given CPR but never regained consciousness, the company said. The cause of death has not been confirmed but he is believed to have drowned, it added. Clipper Ventures said an investigation will look at why the safety tether did not keep Mr Speirs on board. The incident happened as teams raced from South Africa to Australia, with Mr Speirs' crew in sixth place. Clipper Ventures described Mr Speirs as a ""highly experienced sailor"" who had joined the 40,000-mile Clipper Race on 20 August. ""Simon's next of kin have been informed and our deepest thoughts are with his family and all those who knew him,"" the firm said.

Organisers call the Clipper Race ""one of the biggest challenges of the natural world and an endurance test like no other"". Previous sailing experience is not required to enter the race but each of the 12 competing yachts has a fully qualified skipper on board. The year-long event costs Â£49,000 to enter and is the brainchild of Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to sail solo non-stop around the world. London company director Sarah Young, 40, died during the race in 2016 after falling overboard while sailing from China to Seattle. And in 2015, Andrew Ashman, 49, from Orpington in Kent, died after being hit by a rope while competing in the event."
2017-11-19,"Young people today are getting a raw deal compared with their parents' generation, according to the experts.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171120053029/https://news.sky.com/story/sky-data-should-we-take-from-the-old-to-give-to-the-young-11134995,"Millennials earn less than previous generations did at the same age, have been saddled with huge student debts, and spend vastly more on renting lower quality housing. Meanwhile, older people have been increasingly well looked after by the Government - indeed, the income of the average pensioner is now higher than that of the average working family. Even regarding the luxuries most associated with Millennial spending, it is actually among their elders that the expansion has been greatest. For all the column inches advising young people to eat fewer shop-bought sandwiches or avocado on toast to afford a deposit on a house, it is older working age adults - not Millennials - whose behaviour has shifted substantially towards eating out more. This is a problem for the Conservative Government, particularly given both turnout and support for the Labour Party rose by double digits among the youngest generation in June's general election. Thus has Philip Hammond been tasked with producing a 'Budget for intergenerational fairness' this week, with tax giveaways to the young and cuts to tax relief for pensioners among the policies mooted. So, should he take from the old to give to the young? New Sky Data polling suggests that - not for the first time - the British public do not share the view of the experts. Four in 10 - 42% - do think that young people are getting less than their fair share from the Government, with 29% saying they get the right amount and 12% saying they get more than their share. But older people don't think the young are doing too badly: only 29% of those aged 55 and over think young people get less than their fair share. Across the population, older people are actually seen as getting a worse deal from the Government than the young. A majority - 54% - think they get less than their fair share, with 23% saying they get the right amount and 16% saying they get more than their share. And it's actually the young who are the biggest advocates for their elders - 60% of 18-34s say older people get less than their fair share from the Government. While the Chancellor has been under pressure to take from the old to give to the young, these results suggest that could be counterproductive - even among young voters. In a hypothetical trade-off between young and older people, Britons would rather take from the young to give to the old than the other way around. Eighteen percent would take from the young to give to the older, 13% would take from the old to give to the young, 29% would keep things as they are, while 30% answer 'none of these'. And the underlying reasons are clear when you break it down by age. Older people are happy with the status quo - by far the largest proportion of those aged 55 and over think things should stay as they are (48%). Younger people, on the other hand, simply reject the assumption that you have to take from one to give to the other - perhaps unsurprisingly, given that they tend to be more left wing than their elders. By far the largest proportion of those aged 18-34 answer 'none of these' (49%), with only 13% favouring the status quo. Taking from the old to give to the young may increase intergenerational fairness on paper - depending, of course, on the details. But it could be the worst of all worlds for the Government. Older people have little sympathy for the plight of Millennials, in contrast to the concern of the young for their elders. If there is to be spending on the young, it appears the young themselves want it to come from borrowing - or the Prime Minister's ""Magic Money Tree"" - but not from the pockets of their parents and grandparents."

Meanwhile, her twin sister has said she is ""heartbroken"" at the loss of her ""beautiful twin"". Maya Pope-Sutherland wrote on Facebook: ""Can't find any words right now. Gaia is my everything and I am heartbroken. I thank everyone who was involved in searching for my beautiful twin. Going to make her so proud."" The message appeared above a picture of her sister, with the message: ""R.I.P Gaia"".

2017-11-20,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

Although Mr Greenwood had a majority among the UN Security Council, Mr Bhandari won the most backing in the General Assembly - with the Indian judge's popularity seen to be increasing as support for the Briton diminished. Based at The Hague, the UN court has 15 members and its job is to settle disputes between countries. The UK's permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, said: ""The UK has concluded that it is wrong to take up the valuable time of the Security Council and the UN General Assembly with further rounds of elections. ""The UK congratulates the successful candidates, including Judge Bhandari of India. ""We are naturally disappointed, but it was a competitive field with six strong candidates. ""If the UK could not win in this run-off, then we are pleased that it is a close friend like India that has done so instead. The setback is being regarded by some diplomats as the result of waning international influence following the vote to leave the European Union. Five judges are elected to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) every three years. Ronny Abraham of France, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf of Somalia, Antonio Augusto Cancado Trindade of Brazil and Nawaf Salam of Lebanon have been elected to the bench along with Judge Bhandari."
2017-11-20,"Households are more than Â£400-a-year worse off as a result of inflation caused by the Brexit vote, a research group has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-vote-has-made-households-163400-a-year-worse-off-11135493,"A report from the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) says the average household is paying Â£404-a-year extra on food and household items due to rising prices. After the EU referendum vote, the falling value of the pound in comparison with most other currencies has seen the cost of many imports increased. The CEP, which is based at the London School of Economics (LSE), said the impact of the price increases is equivalent to a Â£448 cut in annual pay for the average worker - the equivalent of one week's pay. Dr Thomas Sampson, who co-wrote the research, said: ""Even before Brexit occurs, the increase in inflation caused by the Leave vote has already hurt UK households. ""Our results provide compelling evidence that, so far, UK households are paying an economic price for voting to leave the EU."" Dr Sampson's research found that the rise in inflation has been lowest for households in London, with Scotland, Wales and especially Northern Ireland being the worst hit. The report found the greatest price rises have affected product groups which rely heavily on imports, including bread, cereals, milk, tea and coffee, beer and wine, jewellery, and furniture and furnishings. During the referendum campaign, the CEP was accused by Conservative pro-Brexit MP Bernard Jenkin of producing partisan research designed to convince the public to stay in the EU, something the LSE strenuously denied. The Food Foundation, meanwhile, has raised concerns that the Government's target for people to eat ""five-a-day"" may become unaffordable for millions of Britons. In a separate report, the foundation claims that in a 'no deal' Brexit scenario, price rises would mean the poorest 10% of the population could end up spending at least half of their entire budget for food and drink just to meet current Government guidance for fruit and veg. The report says that of the UK's 50 favourite fruit and veg, with 16, there is the potential to grow more in the UK. This could mean consumers are given more protection from the impact of currency fluctuations on prices. Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, said: ""The Government faces a clear choice to boost British harvests of fruit and veg or the NHS will reap the consequences."""
2017-11-20,New advice has been published to help tackle the problem of pregnancy and maternity discrimination.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/pregnancy-discrimination-advice-updated-as-more-women-seek-advice-11136610,"The conciliation service Acas says it is in response to a sharp increase in calls for advice. Last year, 14,000 people rang the service for help - an increase of nearly 10% compared with the previous year. ""It's all really about trying to change the employer's mindset and get them to understand what they have to do to comply with the law and treat their employees in a fair way,"" says Acas employment expert David Webb. The new guidance includes making sure women know about promotion opportunities while they are on maternity leave. It also covers areas such as not including pregnancy-related absences on an employee's record. Employers who fail to follow the guidance could find themselves in front of a tribunal. Joeli Brearly was fired after she told her bosses she was pregnant. ""They sacked me by voicemail which was horrific. I felt like my career was completely over,"" she says. Ms Brearly started the online campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed to help others in similar situations. Over 1,000 women have shared their stories. ""Women who experience pregnancy and maternity discrimination don't feel comfortable talking publicly,"" she said. ""Some say they sign a confidentiality agreement which means they are gagged, they are unable to talk about this legally. ""For many others it means that they will jeopardise their careers, so who wants to hire a troublemaker?"" Julie Denis, head of diversity and inclusion at Acas, says: ""Women should not suffer any unfair treatment while pregnant or on maternity leave. This new guidance can help managers deal fairly with women at work in areas such as recruitment, promotion and redundancy."" But some - such as director of Maternity Action Rosemary Bragg - believe the answer lies with Parliament. ""In January of this year the Government gave a commitment to review protection of unfair redundancy for new mothers,"" she says. ""We're still waiting for that review to happen and it is urgently needed. One in every 20 new mothers is made redundant. We need to do more to make sure women can retain their jobs when they have a baby."""
2017-11-20,A father who was found guilty of murdering his children by smothering them with a petrol-soaked cloth has been jailed for life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/father-jailed-for-life-for-murdering-his-two-children-with-petrol-soaked-cloth-11135563,"Taxi driver Endris Mohammed, 47, was given a minimum of 33 years for killing his eight-year-old son, Saros, and his six-year-old daughter, Leanor, at their family home in Birmingham. Both children died from airway obstruction after suffering chemical burns to their faces. Mohammed was also given a concurrent 10-year sentence at Birmingham Crown Court for the attempted murder of his wife, Penil Teklehaimanot. She was asleep when her husband killed their children. He had tampered with a gas pipe and set fire to their front door. A jury unanimously found him guilty of the crimes on Friday, 17 November. The Uber driver fled in his cab after killing the children at their home in Holland Road in the early hours of 28 October last year. He suffered burns to his head after setting fire to the passenger side of his cab. He had bought a fuel can and three litres of petrol the previous day. His wife gave evidence at the trial and said her husband was ""a gentle, quiet man"" who did not seem angry in the months before the murders. She said Mohammed smothered the children during a half-term ""sleepover"" downstairs. She was woken up by a fire alarm and thought her children were sleeping when she was unable to wake them. Mohammed did not give evidence during the trial but his lawyers argued he was depressed about his future and his financial situation. Despite Mohammed's claims that he decided to end his life over financial worries, police enquiries found the family could have lived off Mrs Teklehaimanot's earnings as a care worker. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Gilbart accepted Mohammed was suffering from a depressive illness falling short of diminished responsibility, but said a withdrawal from a cash machine hours beforehand showed he had not intended to take his own life. ""Their mother escaped death but she must endure that tragic loss as she rebuilds her life. They (the children) loved you, as did your partner,"" the judge said. ""They trusted you implicitly and were enjoying your company even on the night of their murder. You repaid their trust in you by killing them."""
2017-11-20,"A new ""millennial"" railcard that could save 26 to 30-year-old passengers hundreds of pounds a year is expected to be confirmed in tomorrow's Budget.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/the-budget-under-30s-to-benefit-from-new-millennial-railcards-11136633,"The scheme, which involves paying Â£30 a year in exchange for 33% off rail travel, is expected to operate in a similar way to the young person's railcard for those aged 16 to 25. Although the age limit increase could benefit about 4.5 million people, it will still not be possible to get a discount on season tickets - with costs often running into many thousands of pounds a year. Some of those who would be eligible for the new railcard have told Sky News they would welcome extra savings nonetheless. ""It'll give me a bit more disposable income,"" said Lauren Gray, 27, adding that it would help her save for a mortgage. Anani Thomas, 21, likes the idea of the discount he currently enjoys continuing for longer. He said: ""I think I'm spending roughly Â£50 a week on travel, just to get to and from uni. So I think something like that would definitely be beneficial to the students and younger people."" Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to say that since more young people will travel by rail because of the discount, their fares will cover the cost of the scheme. But the move comes just weeks before overall train ticket prices are set to go up. The Rail Delivery Group is expected to announce next month that fares will rise by 3.6% from January - in line with government policy that ties increases to the Retail Price Index. Stephen Joseph, head of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""Having a wider young person's railcard would be welcome. But we need much more reform of the fare system than that - in particular this year when inflation is high. ""We've been arguing we need a complete freeze on rail fares in the general January fares rise and also more reform such as season tickets for part-time workers."" Meanwhile, Labour described the announcement as a Conservative Party ploy to lure younger voters, who largely turned out for Jeremy Corbyn at the last election. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""It really is a sad indictment and condemnation of a government that hasn't served that generation. ""At the age of 26 to 30, you'd like to think that people are at their full power and able to get on with their lives - but they don't because they have an inability to get on the housing ladder, they're saddled with student debt, wages have stagnated and they're still going to be subjected to the highest rail fares in all of Europe."" The new railcard is expected to launch in spring 2018."
2017-11-20,Changing a company name can be a risky business.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/there-is-a-kind-of-logic-in-eurotunnels-new-name-11135596,"Sometimes, there is no option, if a business is trying to put an especially notorious incident behind it. A classic example here is the nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria known as Sellafield. It used to be known as Windscale, a name that became synonymous with what was, at the time, the world's worst nuclear accident in 1957, sparking a rebrand in 1981. Another is Ratners, the jewellery chain that was never regarded in the same light after 1991 when chief executive Gerald Ratner notoriously described products sold by the retailer as ""crap"". It was later renamed Signet. Other name changes are forced on a company when it changes hands or demerges from its parent. A good example here is Accenture, the management consultancy firm, which used to be known as Andersen Consulting. It was originally part of the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, but renamed itself in 2001 to underline its separate identity - a move of genius, as it transpired, because later that year its former parent was effectively toppled by its involvement in the scandal surrounding the US power company Enron. Sometimes, name changes are made necessary following a merger or takeover, such as the rebranding of Midland Bank once bought by HSBC or the more recent rechristening of the tour operator Thomson as TUI. British Steel had to drop its name after its merger with Dutch rival Hoogovens in favour of Corus Group. The name Aviva was born as a substitute for the unwieldy CGNU, adopted as a moniker when the old CGU (itself created by a merger between Commercial Union and General Accident) joined forces with Norwich Union. Another reason for a name change is when a company moves away from its original function or purpose. Wolseley, the owner of the Plumb Center and Builder's Center builder's merchants chains, was founded in 1887 as the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company but later diversified into cars. A name change was long overdue once both those activities were dropped by the company, which earlier this year renamed itself Ferguson, after its main US business. And then, sometimes, companies change their name seemingly for the hell of it. The most infamous example here is the way the Post Office decided to rename itself Consignia in 2001. It argued the new name, created by a brand consultancy for Â£2m, was more appropriate for a business involved in dynamic business sectors such as e-commerce and financial services. But the public hated it and, when new chairman Allan Leighton came on board 16 months later, he replaced it with the more traditional Royal Mail Group. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that today's name change from Groupe Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel tunnel, falls into this latter category. For the millions of people who have been through the tunnel since it opened to passengers in 1994, Eurotunnel pretty well sums up what the company does, rather like Post Office did. The new name, Getlink, doesn't automatically suggest much. Adding to the unease is this explanation in the company's stock exchange announcement: ""This new name, reflecting the dynamism of connection and exchange, marks the group's passage into an exciting new era for mobility infrastructures."" Except there is a kind of logic involved in the change of name. As Jacques Gounon, the chairman since 2005 points out, the Channel tunnel is one of just one of four businesses operated by the company. It also owns Europorte, the leading private rail freight operator in France; ElecLink, the future electricity interconnector between Britain and France; and Ciffco, Europe's biggest private training centre for the railway industry. The name Getlink is taken partly from the company's code on the French stock market (all companies have a short code or ""ticker"") of GET, derived from Group EuroTunnel, while ""link"" comes from ElecLink. This latter business, operating a high-voltage direct current between the British and French power grids due to open in 2019, is clearly expected to generate substantial profits in future. So while this name change may sound wacky, not least to the 75,000 or so British investors still thought to own shares in Eurotunnel, there is a kind of logic behind it."
2017-11-20,The parents of a stillborn baby have released a picture of their son to help highlight new research that shows pregnant women can halve the risk of stillbirth simply by going to sleep in the correct position.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/stillbirth-breakthrough-women-urged-to-sleep-on-side-11135157,"Hayley and Adam Powsney, from Bury, Greater Manchester, hope that the image of baby Joshua will help draw attention to the findings and underline the heartache that stillbirth brings. ""He died in the delivery process,"" Mrs Powsney told Sky News. ""That changes you completely as a person."" She added: ""From the moment they told me there was nothing more they could do my world just collapsed. I had my baby in my arms and he didn't cry. There's nothing that can prepare you for that."" In the largest study to examine maternal sleep and stillbirth, scientists assessed more than 1,000 pregnant women. Stillbirth is 15 times more common than cot death and Britain has one of the worst records in the developed world. Researchers say the results of the latest study could potentially save 100,000 babies a year if the risk was eliminated internationally. The work was carried out by Tommy's Stillbirth Research Centre in Manchester. The centre's clinical director, Professor Alex Heazell, said: ""Around 11 babies are stillborn every day in the UK. ""Stillbirth is devastating with long-lasting effects on bereaved parents. Parents want to know why their baby has died, whether it might happen again if they try for another baby and what they can do to avoid further stillbirth."" A public health campaign has been launched to accompany the publication of the results. The ""Sleep on Side"" campaign aims to educate women about the risk of going to sleep on their back in late pregnancy. It includes a video showing how a mother-to-be should lie when nodding off. The advice applies to sleep in the third trimester (after 28 weeks) including: :: Going to sleep at night:: Returning to sleep after night awakenings:: Daytime naps As the going-to-sleep position is the one held longest during the night, women shouldn't be worried if they wake up on their back but should simply roll over onto their side. Although researchers can't say for certain why the risk is increased, there are several theories. In the third trimester, when the woman is lying on her back, the combined weight of baby and uterus (womb) puts pressure on the main blood vessels that supply the uterus, and this can restrict blood flow/oxygen to the baby. Other possible explanations include disturbed breathing during sleep, which is worse when a woman sleeps on her back and in overweight or obese women, who also have an increased risk of stillbirth. The advice is being supported by the Powsneys, who went on to have two healthy babies. ""We want Joshua's life to mean something,"" said Mr Powsney. ""Our oldest child is now two-and-a-half. We're going to explain to her that she had an older brother. If we can help Tommy's Research Centre his life will mean something."""
2017-11-20,"The controversial sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley is nearing the final whistle as the owner of Newcastle United Football Club after receiving a formal takeover offer from Amanda Staveley, the financier.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/staveley-hands-ashley-163300m-newcastle-bid-11136293,"Sky News has learnt that Ms Staveley's PCP Capital Partners tabled a bid worth in the region of Â£300m to buy Newcastle from Mr Ashley late last week. It was unclear on Monday evening whether PCP was the only credible bidder for the club, although people close to the process said the logical next step would be to award Ms Staveley a period of exclusivity within which to negotiate a deal. That could come as soon as this week, according to insiders. PCP's money is a combination of Ms Staveley's equity and that of her major investors, which include funds based in the Middle East. Announcing his intention to sell the club last month, lawyers for Mr Ashley said he hoped to finalise the sale of the Premier League outfit by Christmas, although it remains possible that the process could slip into the new year. Speculation about Ms Staveley's intentions has been rampant since she attended Newcastle's home match against Liverpool earlier this season. PCP had been exploring a deal to buy the Merseyside club from its American owners for much of the last year, but was ultimately deterred by their repeated attempts to increase Liverpool's price tag. Negotiations with Mr Ashley, who has faced incessant criticism from Newcastle fans for a perceived dearth of investment in new players, remain subject to agreement on the precise price at which he is prepared to sell the club. One City ally of the Sports Direct tycoon believes the headline valuation attached to any deal will exceed Â£300m, with PCP expected to allocate substantial transfer funds to Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez. Ms Staveley's track record in both finance and football has encouraged Newcastle's loyal army of supporters that her potential arrival as the club's owner will herald a new era of stability on Tyneside. She was the orchestrator of Manchester City's takeover by Abu Dhabi-based investors in 2008 - not long after Mr Ashley had bought Newcastle for more than Â£240m. It is in a legal context that Ms Staveley has attracted repeated attention in the financial press, however, amid long-running civil proceedings she launched against Barclays in relation to its multibillion pound fundraisings during the 2008 banking crisis. That case is unlikely to conclude for some time as the bank contends with a separate criminal probe brought by the Serious Fraud Office. Ms Staveley is understood to be keen to line up a string of commercial partnerships to replace those negotiated under Mr Ashley, including the association of Sports Direct's name with its St James's Park home. A change of control at Newcastle is expected to come ahead of the three-yearly auction of live Premier League broadcasting rights - the bulk of which are held in the UK by Sky plc, the owner of Sky News. A spokesman for Ms Staveley declined to comment on Monday night, while Mr Ashley's spokesman could not be reached for comment."

And he warned there would be no ""cherry picking"" of the elements of the single market Britain wanted to keep. As a result, he added, the UK will have to lose the so-called ""EU banking passport"" - which allows British banks full access to the market for financial services across the bloc. A survey of City of London-based financial services firms by Reuters in September found that nearly half said they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses if the UK's sector loses the privileges it has enjoyed as part of the single market. Mr Barnier said the UK faced an ""important and decisive"" choice as it prepared for the talks with the EU to move on to trade. He said: ""There will be no ambitious partnership without common ground on fair competition, state aid, tax-dumping, food safety, social and environmental standards. ""If we manage to negotiate an orderly withdrawal, fully respecting the integrity of the single market and establishing a level playing field, there is every reason for our future partnership to be ambitious. This is our preferred option. ""This is why we have started internal preparations with member states, to be ready to talk about the future as soon as we will have agreed on how to settle the past. ""The EU will, of course, be ready to offer its most ambitious FTA (free trade agreement) approach."" But, he warned that while Brussels would be ready for a no-deal outcome, it would not be a positive result. ""I regret that this no-deal option comes up so often in the UK public debate,"" he said. ""Only those who ignore, or want to ignore, the current benefits of European Union membership can say that no deal would be a positive result."" Mr Barnier's speech to the Centre for European Reform think tank came as a Cabinet committee meets to discuss whether to raise the amount the UK is prepared to offer the EU to settle its bill. Theresa May is thought to have offered nearly Â£18bn, but it emerged over the weekend the Prime Minister may be prepared to double the offer. The Brexit pay-off is one of the three issues that have to be agreed before the EU is willing to move the talks on to trade, along with the rights of expats and the Irish border. Mr Barnier suggested there was still much work to be done before an agreement can be reached on the Ireland/Northern Ireland border. ""I expect the UK, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to come forward with proposals,"" he said. ""The island of Ireland is now faced with many challenges.Those who wanted Brexit must offer solutions."" It came just two days after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told Sky News an agreement on the border and the financial settlement was not ""close"". Mrs May said: ""We've already made progress on a number of areas we've been negotiating on. There's more that we will be talking about. But what I've very clear about is that the EU and the UK should move forward together on these issues. ""We want to build a deep and special partnership with the European Union for the future. That would be good for industries, for jobs, across the country and it will also be good for the European Union."" The Â£36bn is well short of the â¬60bn (Â£53bn) originally sought by Brussels."

2017-11-20,Argentina's navy has said that a mystery sound detected underwater did not come from a missing submarine with 44 crew members on board.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/mystery-noise-could-be-missing-submarine-11136421,"The noise - heard by two navy ships - had come from about 225 miles (360km) off the coast, and their position was in line with the path that ARA San Juan would have taken to reach its destination. There was hope that the crew was making the ""constant"" sound to draw the attention of potential rescuers. Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi has now confirmed the noise is unrelated to the vessel - and told reporters it had likely come from a ""biological"" source. He added: ""We all had hope, but unfortunately this comes from believing sources that are not trustworthy. Some sources were saying that this was banging on the hull in Morse code signals."" ARA San Juan disappeared 268 miles off Argentina's southern Atlantic coast on Wednesday, with the UK, US, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay all assisting in the search. This is the latest setback for their operation. On Saturday, there was hope that the crew may have attempted to make contact through seven failed satellite calls - but it later emerged that these too were unrelated. :: Key questions on disappearance of ARA San Juan Initially the country's navy suspected that the submarine, which left the southern city of Ushuaia for Mar del Plata more than 1,800 miles away, had suffered a communications problem. The navy later revealed that it had reported a mechanical breakdown in its final transmission. The crew were thought to have several days of food supply, but - unlike nuclear-powered UK and US submarines - the 66m (216ft) long ARA San Juan is diesel electric, meaning that it has a finite supply of fuel, food and oxygen. According to national Argentinian newspaper La Nacion, it was subjected to years of complex repair and engineering work in 2008, which the country's navy believed would extend its life by 30 years. President Mauricio Macri tweeted that the Argentine government would ""continue to deploy all available national and international resources"" to find the submarine."

A scheme in Manchester invited 2,500 people aged 55 to 74 with a history of smoking for CT scans in car parks, community hubs and shopping centres. One in 33 showed signs of cancer, but four out of five of the cases were caught early - at stage one or two. Similar services will now be set up in four locations including London, the North and part of Yorkshire. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens will officially announce the scheme's expansion at The Economist War On Cancer event in London. Dany Bell, from Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""The earlier that someone is diagnosed with cancer, the better their chance of successful treatment is. ""So it's great news that this pilot scheme is now going to be rolled out across other parts of England. ""Lung cancer is a notoriously difficult type to diagnose at an early stage, and initiatives such as this make it easier for high-risk people to get their health checked."" British Lung Foundation honorary medical adviser Dr Nick Hopkinson also welcomed the expansion of the scheme. ""By the time lung cancer causes symptoms it is usually too late for it to be cured. CT screening tests mean that it can be picked up at a much earlier stage."" It comes as a new audit shows lung cancer operations have hit a new high. There were 5,936 lung cancer removal operations in English hospitals in 2015 - up from 5,657 operations in 2014.

Following the discovery of a woman's body on Saturday, police say there were no injuries to ""suggest any other person was involved in her death"". The three people arrested, who had been released under investigation, have now been released without further action. ""Following the results of the post-mortem examination and other ongoing investigative enquiries, we have concluded that no one else was involved in Gaia's death,"" Detective Superintendent Paul Kessell, of Dorset Police, said. ""As such we have today, Monday 20 November, released from our investigation two men aged 19 and 49 and a 71-year-old woman, all from Swanage, who had been arrested and were assisting with our inquiries."" The force said the arrests would have caused ""stress and anxiety"" but said it had an obligation to explore every possible line of inquiry in a missing person investigation. ""Our aim was not only to find Gaia but to find out what happened to her,"" said DS Kessell. The teenager, who suffered from epilepsy, was last seen in Manor Gardens, Swanage, at about 4pm on 7 November. The body, which has not yet been formally identified, but which officers say they are confident is Gaia, was found on land near Swanage on Saturday, close to where clothes were discovered in a field near cliffs. Hundreds of people had joined a search for the missing teenager on Saturday, scouring countryside and coastline in Dorset. Tributes have since poured in, with Gaia's twin sister Maya Pope-Sutherland thanking all those who turned out to look for her, and saying she was ""heartbroken"". ""Can't find any words right now. Gaia is my everything and I am heartbroken. I thank everyone who was involved in searching for my beautiful twin. Going to make her so proud,"" she wrote on Facebook. Gaia's father Richard Sutherland earlier said he feared his daughter's epilepsy may have played a part in her disappearance as doctors warned her that she was at risk of sudden death from the condition. On Saturday, her elder sister Clara Pope said: ""She is the absolute light of my life. So beautiful, so emotionally wise and intelligent and so passionate and artistic and creative... I will always, always, always be one of three."""
2017-11-20,Impeachment proceedings to remove Robert Mugabe from power will begin later after a deadline for him to resign passed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/process-of-impeaching-animal-robert-mugabe-to-begin-in-zimbabwe-11136638,"Zimbabwe's leader stunned his country on Sunday when he failed to announce that he was stepping down. An ultimatum from his Zanu-PF party to resign by midday on Monday or face impeachment also came and went with no word from Mr Mugabe. The party will now press ahead with impeachment by tabling a motion, and it believes it can all be done and dusted in a couple of days - contrary to the view of some experts. ""We want to get rid of this animal called Mugabe. We have the numbers, the opposition is also going to support us,"" said Zanu-PF MP Vongai Mupereri. ""We are going to impeach - the man has to go,"" MP MacKenzie Ncube told the AFP news agency. Zimbabwe's military chief said on Monday evening that a road map to hand over power had been agreed with Mr Mugabe. Constantino Chiwenga said vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose firing led to the unrest in the country, would return to Zimbabwe ""shortly"" to meet the President. Rubbing the noses of his opponents and most of his citizens, Mr Mugabe is also set to host a cabinet meeting on Tuesday at his official residence. The 93-year-old has ruled Zimbabwe with an iron fist since 1980 and the end of British colonialism, but events last week have brought him to the brink. The vice president's sacking put Mugabe's unpopular wife, Grace, in prime position to succeed him. The army promptly seized power and put the President under house arrest - but insisted it had not staged a coup. Despite the impeachment machinery getting moving on Tuesday, lawyers have told Sky News it could take months to prise him from power. Tarisai Mutangi, a constitutional lawyer, said: ""He knows the law is on his side, that the constitution is on his side and that the kingpins of this process want to do it constitutionally, and that means it's going to take quite some time."" Under the Zimbabwean constitution, the president can be impeached for four things: :: Serious misconduct:: Failure to obey, uphold or defend this constitution:: Willful violation of this Constitution:: Inability to perform the functions of the office because of physical or mental incapacity"
2017-11-20,"A lost interstellar asteroid has entered the solar system after wandering between the stars for hundreds of millions of years, scientists believe.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/oumuamua-lost-interstellar-asteroid-enters-solar-system-11136251,"The dark red object named Oumuamua, is about 400 metres (1,312 ft) long, scientists reported in the journal Nature. It is the first space rock from outside the solar system ever observed by astronomers. A telescope in Hawaii designed to spot Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) spotted the asteroid on 19 October as a faint point of light moving in the sky. After further observations and orbital calculations, there was no doubt the object originated from outside the solar system. Moving at 95,000 kilometres per hour (59,030 mph), Oumuamua was at first thought to have travelled from the bright star Vega, 25 light years away in the northern constellation of Lyra. But Vega was nowhere near its current position 300,000 years ago, when its journey would have started. That has led scientists to speculate that the asteroid is an interstellar wanderer that happens to have stumbled across our solar system. ""Oumuamua may well have been wandering through the Milky Way, unattached to any star system, for hundreds of millions of years before its chance encounter with the solar system,"" Dr Karen Meech, from the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii, said. ""This unusually large variation in brightness means that the object is highly elongated,"" she added. ""We also found that it has a dark red colour, similar to objects in the outer solar system, and confirmed that it is completely inert, without the faintest hint of dust around it."" The rock's properties suggest it could have a high metal content and lacks significant amounts of water or ice, and its surface has become dark and red by the impact of cosmic rays over millions of years. Astronomers estimate that interstellar asteroids pass through the inner solar system about once a year, but they are difficult to see because they are so faint. Oumuamua was discovered by the 1.8 metre Pan-STARR telescope in Hawaii, which is part of a system set up to track potentially threatening NEOs."

Sky Data polling from the new think tank, the Centre for Towns, also found 68% of those living in towns think politicians don't care about their area, against 54% for city-dwellers. And 53% of people in towns say their area is less well off, compared with just 36% of people in cities. The research comes against a backdrop of increasing divergence in the views and experiences of people in towns and cities, reflected by the Brexit vote. Towns - particularly those in a state of decline, measured by economic activity, population, and the proportion of the population with a degree - were much more likely to vote for Leave in the EU referendum than people in cities. And a sharp contrast in party political views is also revealed. Labour have enjoyed a five-point net swing from the Tories in cities, comparing votes in the general elections of 2005 with 2017. While the Conservatives have seen a six-point swing towards them from Labour in small towns in the same time. Will Jennings, Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at the University of Southampton and Co-Founder of Centre for Towns, said: ""The gap between the outlooks of Britain's cities and towns is at the heart of our divided politics. ""People in towns are less likely to think politics is working for their area and feel less central to British society. ""This divide is likely to last until its root causes are addressed with local solutions and innovation. It won't be fixed by populist rhetoric presenting simple solutions to complex problems."""

2017-11-20,British Gas says it will no longer roll customers onto standard variable tariffs (SVTs) from next April - signalling the beginning of the end for the controversial energy bills.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/british-gas-to-end-variable-tariffs-by-april-ahead-of-price-cap-law-11135252,"The country's largest household supplier said it was to phase them out as part of a number of ""big steps"" aimed at transforming the market to give customers a ""fairer, simpler deal and lower bills"". It announced the shift as the Government moves to introduce price caps on SVTs - a default tariff that has no end date and is currently used by 50% of UK homes. The charges have been described by the Prime Minister as a ""rip-off"". British Gas currently has five million SVT customers on its books. It said it was to remove tariffs without an end date to new customers from the spring - offering a series of fixed deals instead. But, crucially, it said those customers currently on an SVT still had to decide to exit that rolling default charge - leaving its existing SVT customer base locked in to an SVT unless they chose to move. The firm, part of the so-called ""big six"" players, said it was already contacting all its SVT customers at least twice a year in a bid to bolster switching - with 10% persuaded to change tariff this year. The company said it remained legally obliged to offer a default charge to customers who refused to engage - and that would be a fixed-rate charge, limited to 12 months, for new customers. Its other proposals included taking the cost of Government green initiatives - currently around Â£200 annually - out of energy bills and placing them in the tax system instead and simpler bills. Chief executive of British Gas parent firm Centrica, Iain Conn, said: ""We fully recognise that the energy market can and should be improved, but further price controls will only set this back. ""We believe more action is needed and are ready to play a leading role. Today we have set out the unilateral actions we will take to improve the UK energy market for our customers. ""This starts with the withdrawal of the SVT which contributes to lower levels of customer engagement. ""We also believe that further measures by Ofgem and the Government are required so that together we can create a market that works for everyone, where there is improved transparency and a fairer allocation of costs currently included in the energy bill."" The company insisted its plan was not a consequence of the price cap but a product of many months of thought. Its big six competitors were yet to give their reaction but the price comparison service, uSwitch, voiced fears on the replacement for SVTs. Its head of regulation, Richard Neudegg, said: ""What remains to be seen is if customers rolled onto a new fixed deal with British Gas end up finding themselves on another poor value standard tariff by another name."""
2017-11-20,"Theresa May appears to have won the backing of Cabinet Brexiteers to double the UK's ""divorce bill"" offer from Â£20bn to Â£40bn.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-key-leave-ministers-appear-to-back-16340bn-eu-divorce-bill-11136452,"At a tense two-hour meeting of senior ministers in 10 Downing Street, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are believed to have agreed to the move - with conditions. As a result, the Prime Minister is now poised to offer Â£40bn later this week if the rest of the EU is ready to move towards trade talks in December. And in another significant move aimed at breaking the deadlock in Brexit negotiations, the UK will allow a role for the European Court of Justice after Brexit. :: New destinations for London-based EU agencies:: Varadkar throws a spanner in Brexit works The moves were agreed at a meeting of the Cabinet's Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) Cabinet committee, already being called a Brexit ""war Cabinet"". An early signal that ministers were ready to agree to double the UK's divorce bill offer came from the Brexit Secretary David Davis as he arrived for the meeting. Asked by Sky News if he had brought his cheque book along to the meeting, Mr Davis - who is leading the Brexit negotiations - smiled and said: ""No. Yours!"" Another sign that Cabinet Remainers won the day and overruled the Brexiteers came when the Home Secretary Amber Rudd later told Sky News: ""It was a very good meeting."" In contrast, the Cabinet's leading Brexiteers, Mr Johnson and Mr Gove, were tight-lipped as they left No. 10, while Liam Fox left the meeting alongside a silent Mr Davis. The conditions demanded by Mr Johnson and Mr Gove were that the EU must spell out what the UK will receive in return for handing over increasing amounts of taxpayers' money. The Prime Minister wants to persuade EU leaders to allow Brexit talks, stalling in the first phase, to move on to future relationship negations - including a trade deal. She also wants them to agree in principle to a time-limited transition deal after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen did not seem impressed, saying it was ""up for debate"" how to move negotiations on. He told Sky News: ""Whatever deal we do, I've got to be able to look my constituents in the eye and say this is a good deal for our country. ""When there are so many needs for government spending - the health service, schools, police, the armed forces - I think we should be negotiating a bit harder with taxpayers money."" In a speech in Berlin last week, Mr Davis said this would mean access to UK and EU markets continuing on current terms and keeping the rights and obligations of an EU member. Mr Davis said this would include the role of the ECJ and it is believed this was reinforced by the Cabinet ministers at their Downing Street meeting. In a move which could face a backlash from pro-Brexit Tory MPs, this could give the ECJ a role in enforcing the rights of the three million EU migrants in Britain after Brexit. Speaking after the ministers met, a Downing Street source said: ""It remains our position that nothing's agreed until everything's agreed in negotiations with the EU."" And referring to comments the PM made ahead of the meeting, the source added: ""As the Prime Minister said this morning, the UK and the EU should step forward together."""
2017-11-20,Parliament's close procedural combat over Brexit has begun in earnest. All-night sittings and all-out battles between and within parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171121060533/https://news.sky.com/story/twin-tightropes-for-theresa-may-amid-mps-close-brexit-combat-11126950,"It began surreally enough, with Labour's backbench Brexiteer Frank Field arguing about the precise hour of Brexit. His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."

He faces a total of 99 years in prison if found guilty. The MPs, including government minister Matt Hancock, who signed the letter in his capacity as Mr Love's constituency MP, warned that there was ""a great probability"" that Mr Love, who is on a range of medication, would commit suicide if extradited. ""The UK has prosecuted at least 13 computer hackers who have interfered with US-based computer systems,"" they wrote. Many of those hackers did not suffer from the conditions that Mr Love is afflicted with, according to the letter, and yet they were handled by the UK's criminal justice system. They said Mr Love would be the first alleged British computer hacker to be extradited ""and denied the opportunity to face a full prosecution in the UK"". MPs previously wrote to Barack Obama warning that Mr Love would die behind bars if he was extradited to the US. In the new letter, they asked Theresa May and the Attorney General to make representations to their US counterparts to facilitate a prosecution in the UK. Mr Love's case echoes that of Gary McKinnon, who had Asperger's and also faced US allegations of hacking. His extradition was blocked by Mrs May, who was home secretary at the time. Following on from Mrs May's personal intervention to prevent Mr McKinnon's extradition, the Home Office introduced new legislation to stop vulnerable people being sent into the US criminal justice system. Ahead of a High Court appeal hearing next week, the MPs asked: ""Why is the United States insistent on Mr Love's extradition despite the UK having a proven track record of appropriately prosecuting, sentencing and rehabilitating indivdiuals who have committed computer hacking offences against the US?"" Number 10 did not immediately respond to enquiries."

The prehistoric family of four, which were all found together by builders near Tomsk in Siberia 15 years ago, is made up of an adult male and female, a young female aged 8 or 9, and the infant mammoth. The baby mammoth skeleton is particularly prized, with only one other known almost complete infant mammoth skeleton in the world. The small size of the skeletons has led scientists to believe the animals lived in poor conditions, and died up to 16,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene period - a time when glaciers covered large parts of the earth. Most mammoths died out around 10,000 years ago, with a tiny population enduring on isolated Wrangel Island - off the northern coast of eastern Siberia - until 1650 BC. While it is widely believed the animals were driven to extinction by humans, scientists have also found evidence that rising temperatures may have melted the mammoths' habitat, causing them to die. Other extinct animals on sale at the auction include a 205-million-year-old plesiosaur (a marine reptile), a cave bear skeleton, and a rare species of large wild cattle called aurochs - an ancestor of our domestic cattle today.

Earlier, pro-Remain Conservative MPs led by former attorney general Dominic Grieve had threatened a rebellion on protecting human rights after Brexit. Mr Grieve tabled amendments to the bill - proposing that the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights should be part of UK law, as did Jeremy Corbyn and Labour MPs. One of them would have allowed challenges to be brought against EU laws retained after Brexit. But when Solicitor General Robert Buckland pledged a Government rethink, Mr Grieve backed down. Mr Buckland promised a post-Brexit human rights document would also be published in December. ""We have listened and will continue to reflect carefully on all the arguments that have been made today,"" said Mr Buckland. ""We are prepared to look at this issue again. The Government will bring forward its own amendment at report stage."" A clearly relieved Mr Grieve leapt to his feet and told MPs: ""This is a really important concession, which appreciatively reflects the disquiet that has been shown. In the light of that, I will not be pressing my amendment to a vote."" Earlier, moving his amendments, Mr Grieve claimed there could be a ""road crash"" at the bill's report stage, in which he would be unable to support ""a whole series of matters"" unless they could be resolved by consensus. But Mr Buckland's concession failed to satisfy Mr Clarke, whose name was listed second on the amendment and said he would be inquiring whether he had a right to call a vote on it, although he did not in the end. ""It's no good fobbing us off with more discussions - and there'll be amendments which won't actually change the policy,"" Mr Clarke said. He added of the charter: ""If it's doing no harm, why is the Government going to such lengths to get rid of it as the one specific change in this bill? ""Presumably it's because it's got the word European and rights in it, and this was intended from a Daily Telegraph gesture to the hard right wing of my party."" At the end of eight hours of debate, there were five votes: :: An amendment from Labour MP Ellie Reeves, asking for Parliament to be informed of changes in EU law on family-friendly employment rights and gender equality, was defeated by 314-295 - a Government majority of 19. :: A Labour amendment to retain the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in UK law was defeated by 311-301 - a Government majority of just 10. Mr Clarke was the sole Tory rebel. :: A separate Labour amendment to retain the existing principles of EU law within domestic law on or after Brexit day was defeated by 315-296 - a Government majority of 19. :: A fourth vote on Labour MP Mary Creagh's amendment, which called for EU environmental law principles to be retained, was defeated by 315-295 - a Government majority of 20. :: Finally, MPs voted by 313-295 to approve Schedule 1 being part of the Bill. Despite the threat of a Tory backbench rebellion, there was strong support for the Government from some senior Conservative MPs. Former minister Sir Edward Leigh told MPs: ""There's been a cosy consensus so far in this debate that everything about European human rights is wonderful and we want to transfer it into our own law. ""Actually, many of us think that the advancement of European so-called human rights has been at the detriment of the rights of other people, particularly religious people, to find their own space. ""When we retain or regain parliamentary sovereignty in this House and through our democracy we can start asserting the right to real human rights."" And senior Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash said: ""It is up to us to make our own laws and we can make them, we can listen to the arguments, we can make the amendments, we can recognise human rights - and all the other things - as and when."" Speaking after the Commons votes, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said: ""The Government squeaked home, but we will not give up the fight to protect fundamental rights from an extreme Brexit. ""Ministers won't be permitted to weaken vital protections to appease their own Brexiteer backbenchers and ram through a Tory Brexit.

Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."

Mrs Dinch and her grandson Nathan were arrested six days after Miss Pope vanished, and were released under investigation the next day. Paul Elsey was detained on 16 November and released under police investigation the following day. On Monday, it was announced that all three had been released without further police action. Miss Pope's body was discovered on Saturday and police said there were no injuries to ""suggest any other person was involved"". Mrs Dinch's daughter, Deborah Elsey, told The Sun that police had mistakenly held her son because the time clock on CCTV she handed over did not match his account of his movements. This year, UK clocks should have been adjusted by one hour from British Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time on 29 October. Ms Elsey said: ""When they questioned him, the time didn't match the time on the footage so they dragged him in for murder. ""It's ridiculous. The time on the CCTV didn't match because the clocks went back and the time on there didn't change."" Mrs Dinch told the newspaper she had found her arrest traumatic. She said: ""I was just thinking about poor Gaia."" ""I couldn't breathe in the police station and they had to call a nurse in."" Her son, who had told officers he knew Miss Pope, said police ""got it all wrong but it was like talking to a brick wall"". He said: ""It was horrible. They said I was suspected of murder and my first thought was, 'Oh my god, Gaia's dead'."" A post-mortem did not identify any injuries to suggest third-party involvement in the death, with police saying it is being treated as ""unexplained"". Detective Superintendent Paul Kessell, of Dorset Police, said the force had been expected to ""fully investigate the sudden disappearance of a teenage girl"". ""I appreciate our inquiries would have caused these individuals stress and anxiety, however we have an obligation in any missing person investigation to explore every possible line of enquiry,"" he said."
2017-11-21,Environment Secretary Michael Gove is facing a fresh row over his treatment of independent Whitehall directors after demanding that board members commit several days each week to their non-executive roles.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171122062508/https://news.sky.com/story/gove-faces-criticism-as-defra-board-members-quit-over-demands-11136908,"Sky News has learnt that Steve Holliday, the former National Grid chief executive who is one of Britain's leading businessmen, has decided to step down as the lead non-executive director of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) after Mr Gove issued his demands. It is the latest such clash involving Mr Gove, who as secretary of state for education and then justice was accused of packing the departments' boards with close associates who were subsequently handed peerages or knighthoods. His demands of DEFRA's non-executives comes as Mr Gove is reported to be positioning himself to replace Philip Hammond as the Chancellor, with a crucial Budget statement to be made on Wednesday. The Times reported last week that Mr Gove, whose failed Conservative leadership bid last year consigned him to the backbenches for a brief period, was using Cabinet meetings to ""audition"" for Mr Hammond's job. Alongside Mr Holliday, DEFRA's three other non-executives are Catherine Doran, a former Royal Mail executive who serves on the board of the Coventry Building Society; Paul Rew, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers partner who is a director of Northumbrian Water and the Met Office; and Peter Bonfield, chief executive of the Building Research Establishment. Whitehall sources said Ms Doran and Mr Rew would also be stepping down as they approach the end of six years' service on the department's board. One source said Mr Gove was seeking board members who would commit three days a week to the posts, as opposed to the two days per month asked of them when they signed up. The loss of Mr Holliday, who stepped down as the boss of National Grid last year, is likely to raise eyebrows elsewhere in Whitehall. He has earned a reputation as one of the Government's trouble-shooters from the corporate sector, leading an independent review of an expensive debacle at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and a new project to examine full-time social action among young people. None of the non-executives could be reached for comment on Tuesday, but some of them are said to have become concerned that Mr Gove's request, if adhered to, would dilute their independence. One source said Mr Gove was continuing to treat supposedly independent roles ""as if they were his personal SPADs [special advisers]"". DEFRA is understood to have begun seeking replacements for Ms Doran and Mr Rew in September, while it is also creating an additional role to reflect the ministry's increased workload as the UK prepares to leave the European Union. During his time as justice secretary, Mr Gove effectively sacked a quartet of non-executives who included Tim Breedon, the former chief executive of Legal & General, and Dame Sue Street, a former permanent secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. One of those appointed to the MoJ board was Sir Theodore Agnew, who had also been a non-executive director of the Department for Education (DfE) during Mr Gove's tenure there. Sir Theodore was appointed as an education minister in the Lords in September. The identity of the new board recruits at DEFRA may fuel a renewed row about ministers' efforts to politicise the supposedly impartial Whitehall roles. Dozens of figures from the worlds of business were recruited to Whitehall boards in 2010 as part of a project orchestrated by Francis Maude, the then Cabinet Office minister, to improve their governance and operational efficiency. Lord Browne, the former boss of BP, was recruited as the Government's first lead non-executive director working across Whitehall. He was replaced by Sir Ian Cheshire, the chairman of Debenhams, in 2015. A Defra spokesperson said: ""Defra is currently running an open competition for new non-executive board members. ""The advert went live on 9 September and ran until 19 October. Applications are currently being considered. The recruitment process is being run in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines."" A source at DEFRA said that the non-executives were intended to be ministerial appointments, with oversight from the Cabinet Office."

2017-11-21,Higher debt costs meant the Chancellor borrowed more than expected in October as he faces pre-Budget pressure to spend more on public services in uncertain economic times.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171122062508/https://news.sky.com/story/deficit-widens-in-october-ahead-of-hammonds-budget-11136831,"Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the deficit grew to Â£8bn last month - a rise of almost 7% on October 2016. Economists had expected a figure of Â£7.5bn. While Philip Hammond remains on track to meet his borrowing target of Â£58.3bn for the current 2017/18 financial year, October's figure is seen as underlining the scale of the challenge he faces amid Brexit-related headwinds. While higher inflation - a consequence of the weaker pound since the referendum - has intensified the squeeze on household budgets it has also driven up the costs of servicing the UK's debt. :: Sky Views: Hammond Budget makes for dangerous cocktail :: Budget 2017: What do we know of Philip Hammond's plans so far? That is because it pushes up the cost of index-linked bonds for the Treasury. With no sign of inflation falling before Christmas, debt costs linked to interest rates are likely to rise further in the longer term because of the Bank of England rate rise announced this month. However, tax receipts remained relatively healthy in October. The ONS reported that income tax and capital gains tax revenues rose by almost 7%, though those from corporation tax fell by nearly 1%. Sterling dipped slightly following the announcement, trading marginally lower versus the US dollar at $1.3230. Mr Hammond will deliver his Budget on Wednesday against a tough political and economic backdrop. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is widely tipped to trim its growth forecasts as the economy grapples the effects of Brexit uncertainty but also stubbornly weak productivity. The Chancellor has already indicated spending to help get more homes built and investment in transport. :: Theresa May reveals Â£1.7m transport boost ahead of Budget :: Under 30s to benefit from new 'millennial' railcards Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Given the expected downward revisions to the OBR's economic growth forecasts, a pretty poor medium-term outlook for the public finances should therefore restrict the Chancellor's ability to provide a significant giveaway, if he wants to stick to his fiscal rules. ""As a result, we expect tomorrow's Budget to be generally cautious, incorporating a broadly neutral package of tax and spending changes."""

Mr Nguyen was Vietnamese and the other victims were British. Post-mortem examinations were due to start on Sunday. The aircraft both took off from Wycombe Air Park, also known as Booker Airfield, about 20 miles from the site of the collision. Air accident experts are still investigating after the aircraft came down over woodland near the Waddesdon Estate. Mr Nguyen was having helicopter flying training with veteran instructor Michael Green when they were hit by the plane, according to Vietnamese authorities.

The pair are outspoken from the outset as they get ready to open a major exhibition of their art at London's White Cube gallery, timed to mark their 50th year of working together. ""The media are much more Anglophobic than the general public,"" George Passmore says, admitting they often feel under-appreciated by the establishment itself for being ""living and still here"". Gilbert Proesch tells me how, on a recent trip to Paris, and the night prior to our interview at the London gallery, he and his husband found themselves ""being mobbed by young people"". The couple clearly connects with a younger generation that - like the artists - are more familiar with why you might want to put yourself into every picture. ""People say we invented the selfie - there's some truth in that,"" George says, as he stands next to a giant digitally manipulated picture of their faces. The couple clearly get a kick from still being seen as current. ""It's extraordinary,"" says George. ""Every year another generation of young people seem to like our work."" As Gilbert explains: ""When we started out people were saying 'it's very interesting but it won't ever lastâ¦'"" But at last they have. Five decades on, their scatological approach to art might not be everyone's cup of tea, but they certainly have perfected the art of producing work that elicits a reaction. Described by one critic as ""buttoned up exhibitionists"", there are few boundaries they haven't pushed. ""We call it de-shocking pictures,"" Gilbert explains. ""It's to make us free - we are tearing down those walls."" If you're keen to experience an authentic G&G show, the exhibition certainly ticks those boxes. Covering most of the space are The Beard Pictures, in which the pair appear as distorted versions of themselves masked by ""surreal and symbolic"" facial hair. Beards are used as ""an emblem of millennial youth"" but also as a mark of religious faith and social status. If that sounds too tame, there's no escaping the second part of the exhibition. Their 'F***osophy' is a collection of nearly 4,000 statements, all using the F word, written in large font along the main corridor. Certainly not family friendly, but an amusing read. There is often an endearingly puerile quality to their work but the White Cube's artistic director Susan May says the pair's influence shouldn't be underestimated. ""They are real pioneers, when you think about what they've done through performance and also their influence generally across fashion and media,"" she says. ""They want people to have an emotional response or a feeling, it could be that you're outraged or amused but they want to elicit some kind of response."" G&G say they stopped socialising with artists in 1976 as they didn't like the insular elitist art world. George insists they enjoy being the outsiders. He says: ""We don't want to be like an artist because they're all weird, we don't want to be like everybody else because they're normal. ""We want to be weird and normal at the same time because that's the great secret to keeping a free and open mind to create strange and wonderful things."" :: 'Gilbert & George: The Beard Pictures and their F***osophy' runs until 28 January at White Cube, Bermondsey."

Cassidy was rushed to a hospital in Florida last week, with his publicist saying at the weekend that he was suffering organ failure. He revealed earlier this year he was battling dementia after video emerged of him performing erratically in California. Cassidy forgot the words to some of his own songs and yelled at a fan to turn off a light that he claimed was blinding him. He later told People magazine he had been in ""denial"" about his illness and he had decided to stop touring, saying he wanted to ""enjoy life"". Cassidy shot to fame in the early 1970s as Keith Partridge in TV sitcom The Partridge Family, starring opposite his stepmother Shirley Jones. He went on to enjoy a hugely successful pop career and scored two UK number ones with How Can I Be Sure and Daydreamer. The magnitude and speed of Cassidy's fame was noted by Rolling Stone in a 1972 article. It wrote: ""In two years, David Cassidy has swept hurricane-like into the pre-pubescent lives of millions of American girls. ""Leaving: six and a half million long-playing albums and singles; 44 television programmes; David Cassidy lunch boxes; David Cassidy bubble gum; David Cassidy colouring books and David Cassidy pens; not to mention several millions of teen magazines, wall stickers, love beads, posters and photo albums."" Cassidy's fame faded after the show ended but he continued to make music and perform concerts for decades. In recent years he struggled with alcohol problems and was arrested three times for drink-driving between 2010 and 2014. He was ordered to go to rehab as part of his sentence.

""This is the best day of my life,"" said one man, as people celebrated on cars and crowded round tanks to shake hands with the soldiers lauded for their role in getting rid of the reviled leader. :: 'I have beaten Christ' - Mugabe in his own words ""We didn't fight the 1980 war but we fought the 2017 war and we are happy that Mugabe is gone and he's gone for good. Happy new Zimbabwe,"" said another Harare resident. Zimbabweans in other countries also celebrated the downfall of their long-time leader. A crowd gathered outside the country's embassy in London, with people jumping up and down, waving flags and talking of ""national joy"" and a new hope. Zimbabweans living in South Africa took to the streets of Johannesburg and some were pictured burning shirts of the ruling Zanu-PF party. Mr Mugabe announced his resignation with immediate effect on Tuesday afternoon. There was jubilation as a resignation letter was read out in the country's parliament, where impeachment proceedings against the ruler had begun. The 93-year-old said he had chosen to step down ""to ensure a smooth, peaceful and non-violent transfer of power"", and that he had made the decision voluntarily. Exiled vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa is due to land in Zimbabwe at 1.30pm (11.30am UK time) and is later expected to be sworn in as President. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said Zimbabwe had ""an extraordinary opportunity to set itself on a new path"", while British PM Theresa May said it could ""forge a new path free of the oppression that characterised (Mugabe's) rule"". Mr Mugabe's announcement sparked ecstatic scenes in the Zimbabwean capital Harare, where protesters had gathered to call for him to be removed from office. Emmerson Mnangagwa told NewsDay: ""I want to congratulate the people of Zimbabwe on reaching this historic moment. ""Together, we will ensure a peaceful transition to the consolidation of our democracy, and bring in a fresh start for all Zimbabweans and foster peace and unity."" Earlier this month, Mr Mugabe sparked the political crisis which ended his dictatorship by sacking Mr Mnangagwa - paving the way for his wife Grace to succeed him. Military chiefs reacted by taking control of the capital, seizing the state broadcaster and placing Mr Mugabe under house arrest. :: The thrill of being swept up in Zimbabwe's joy The ruler initially refused to stand down and told Zimbabweans in a televised address they must ""learn to forgive"". But he was forced to face impeachment proceedings amid claims he allowed his wife ""to usurp constitutional power"" and had been seen ""sleeping in cabinet and international meetings"" - bringing ""horror and shame"" to Zimbabweans. Mr Mugabe had ruled Zimbabwe since 1980 and his departure leaves the Queen as the world's oldest head of state. Under his presidency, the southern African country's economy collapsed and unemployment rose to more than 90%. :: Profile - Assassination attempts, power grabs and tyranny The 93-year-old has been accused of a range of human rights abuses, including denying food aid to areas supporting the opposition. He has also faced repeated accusations of election vote rigging and intimidation - in 2008 a violent campaign against supporters of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai saw scores killed and thousands displaced. Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe's war veterans group, described Mr Mugabe's resignation as ""the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife"". Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""In recent days we have seen the desire of the Zimbabwean people for free and fair elections and the opportunity to rebuild the country's economy under a legitimate government. :: What next for Zimbabwe's crippled economy? ""As Zimbabwe's oldest friend we will do all we can to support this, working with our international and regional partners to help the country achieve the brighter future it so deserves."""
2017-11-21,"The Government has put pressure on the EU to begin talks on post-Brexit trade in order to help solve questions over the Irish border, in the face of a fresh warning from Dublin.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171122062508/https://news.sky.com/story/govt-pressures-eu-to-move-on-brexit-talks-over-irish-border-issue-11137084,"Theresa May, Boris Johnson and David Davis urged EU leaders to move on to negotiations about Britain's future relationship with the bloc. The three have argued they can't fully discuss border issues regarding the island of Ireland without advancing talks. Cabinet ministers are reported to have agreed an increased offer on the UK's financial settlement of up to Â£40bn, in the hope of breaking the deadlock in Brexit negotiations. It is hoped the promise of extra cash will achieve the EU's demand for ""sufficient progress"" on divorce issues and allow EU leaders to sanction the start of the second phase of exit talks at a key summit next month. But, on Tuesday, the Irish Government repeated its warning that settling the Brexit bill is not the only barrier to progression. In an interview with the Evening Standard, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said: ""Anybody who thinks that just because the financial settlement issue gets resolvedâ¦ that somehow Ireland will have a hand put on the shoulder and be told, 'Look, it's time to move on.' ""Well, we're not going to move on."" Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar last week demanded a formal written guarantee that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland before he will sanction the second phase of Brexit talks. Yet, senior Government figures on Tuesday put pressure back on Brussels and the remaining 27 EU member states over the issue. The Prime Minister, speaking from Downing Street after meeting Northern Irish politicians, said: ""We recognise the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""We want to see people continuing to move across that border, to trade across that border. ""It's important for the economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but it's also important for people in their day-to-day lives. Mrs May added: ""We want to move on to having those more detailed discussions about what that trade relationship will be for the future. ""The EU has made clear that's an issue for phase two, we want to be able to move on to do that."" Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson said ""there's no question the issue of the border is very live in Irish politics"" and repeated the Government's commitment to seeking a solution. Answering questions in the House of Commons, the Vote Leave figurehead said: ""There can be no hard border, that would be unthinkable. ""It would be economic and political madness and we certainly, I think everybody on both sides of this House, understands the social, political and spiritual ramifications of allowing any such thing to happen. ""That's why it's so important that we get on to the second phase of the negotiations, that we get sufficient progress at the European Council in December and we're able to debate these issues in proper."" Labour's Emily Thornberry urged Mr Johnson to make the possible establishment of a hard border a resigning issue for him. Delivering a speech to a summit in Westminster, Mr Davis became the third Government minister to put pressure on the EU to advance Brexit talks. The Brexit Secretary said: ""It's becoming clearer with each new negotiating round we must start talking about our future relationship. ""The Northern Ireland border cannot be fully addressed if we're not taking into account the shape of our future partnership with the EU."" Mr Davis insisted the UK is ""ready to begin that conversation as soon as the EU are""."
2017-11-21,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171122062508/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

""He had a funny anecdote for every occasion,"" it read. ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time. We will miss him terribly."" Bewes starred alongside James Bolam in The Likely Lads - together the pair played two working class friends who worked in the same Newcastle factory. The sitcom, which ran for three series from 1964-66, became one of the BBC's best-loved comedies and turned the pair into household names. In 1973, Bewes and Bolam reprised their roles for the show's sequel, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads, starring alongside Brigit Forsyth and Sheila Fearn. But both actors later fell out and never spoke again. In 2010, Bewes claimed Bolam had prevented the BBC from showing repeats of The Likely Lads. He said: ""I'm very poor so I have to tour one-man shows because Jimmy has buried The Likely Lads. You have to sign a waiver for them to repeat it and he stopped it while he did New Tricks. ""Well, New Tricks has been on so long, and is so repeated, that he must be very wealthy; me, I've just got an overdraft and a mortgage."" He added: ""He should let it be repeated on BBC2 or BBC1; to stop other people earning money is cruel."" Bewes is survived by his four children; Billy, Joe, Tom and Daisy."

Under his command, tens of thousands were slaughtered. For a time he was the world's most wanted man, but as much as the world condemned him as a war criminal, his supporters feted him as the defender of Bosnian-Serb interests. :: Ratko Mladic's deadly legacy in the Balkan wars For years, they refused to believe the allegations of genocide. It was only once a video was discovered in 2005 showing the execution of six young Bosnian Muslims outside Srebrenica that the doubts started to fade. Mladic went on the run, evading capture and living under protection for 16 years. His family tried to have him declared dead, falsely claiming they had not seen or heard from him in years. Brussels insisted Serbia hand him over if they wanted candidacy for the EU - and the pressure eventually paid off. Mladic was finally arrested in the early hours of 26 May 2011. Four cars carrying unmarked security forces entered a village in northern Serbia while everyone was still asleep. They found Mladic walking in the yard of a house belonging to his cousin. He surrendered and was taken to Belgrade. Attempts to throw out his trial on grounds of ill health were rejected. Efforts to delay proceedings were defeated. The Butcher is now an elderly man. A series of strokes have aged the 74-year-old. He might be frail of body, but his reputation lives long and for grim reasons. The numbers are staggering: 100,000 died in the war; millions were left homeless; 50,000 women were raped. To this day, bones are still discovered in the forests around Srebrenica Mladic still has his defenders. The current mayor of Srebrenica, a Serb, denies the genocide. He is not alone in that view. What happened more than 20 years ago still divides communities. The international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague was set up in 1993 purposely for trying the crimes committed in Europe's worst conflict since World War Two. Mladic's is the only verdict left for the court to deliver. It will close next month, after almost a quarter of a decade of work, 5,000 witnesses, 11,000 trial days, 2.5 million sheets of evidence and 83 convictions - Mladic's will be the 84th and final. Some bemoan it for being too lenient, others dismiss it as an arm of NATO. Judicially though, it has done its job. It has painstakingly put away those guilty of gross murder, allowing Europe to put behind it a dark period of recent history. Many of Mladic's victims and their families have travelled to The Hague to hear today's verdict. It will no doubt resurrect unwelcome memories for them, but two decades on they will get the justice they must have never thought possible."

Two lab staff have been arrested and five others questioned as part of a criminal investigation which has been running since February. The alleged tampering involved the manipulation of data from blood samples by staff at Randox Testing Services in Manchester. Three-quarters of the investigations potentially affected involve traffic offences, such as drug-driving, though the rest include 274 homicide and 900 rape cases. In some of the cases that have been stopped, there was no sample available for retesting, or the quality or quantity of the sample was too small. However, retesting in the most serious cases has so far found no evidence of tampering, said the NPCC's James Vaughan. He said 70% of the planned retesting - involving all but one of Britain's police forces - had been completed and the rest would be finished by summer next year. Randox Testing Services said it had alerted police to the alleged tampering and was supporting the investigation by Greater Manchester Police. The company said it was funding the costs of retesting. A spokesperson said: ""We will do all that we can to ensure this situation is resolved and deeply regret the distress that has been caused. ""We are now well advanced in developing a foolproof testing system which would enhance the security of our operations in the future, to provide the necessary level of confidence."" Potential tampering is being investigated at a second company, Trimega Laboratories, where the two arrested suspects also worked. Trimega deals with child protection and family court cases. Gillian Tully, of the Forensic Services Regulator, said all major forensic toxicology suppliers had been asked to carry out a detailed audit of a sample of their cases to ensure the issue is not more widespread. The audits uncovered no such data manipulation. ""If there was large-scale manipulation going on across the board I do expect it would have been found during that audit,"" she said."

The Chancellor will say: ""For the first time in decades, Britain is genuinely at the forefront of a technological revolution, not just in our universities and research institutes, but this time in the commercial development labs of our great companies and on the factory floors and business parks across the land. ""So we must invest to secure a bright future for Britain, and at this Budget that is what we choose to do."" :: Eight things to read before the Budget The Chancellor is expected to inject hundreds of millions extra into the NHS as the single biggest measure, but still disappoint expectations within the health system of a Â£4bn boost to avert an immediate waiting times crisis. He will call time on centrally enforced public sector pay caps, but at the same time is not expected to provide the funding for a general pay rise in line with inflation. :: Sky correspondents' tips on what to expect In a battle to improve the UK's skills and better long-term productivity, Mr Hammond is also due to announce a Â£177m scheme to give schools and sixth forms in England Â£600 for every additional student taking A-level maths or core maths qualifications. In addition, a Â£42m fund will give Â£1,000 worth of training for every teacher in selected schools in areas that have ""fallen behind"". The Chancellor will also seek to bridge the generational gap in Conservative popularity by offering cheap rail travel, cuts to stamp duty and an extensive increase in housebuilding. The ambition to increase housebuilding to 300,000 a year is something not reached in the UK since 1978, a time when the government itself built half of all homes. It is also the first minority government Budget since Denis Healey's final Budget of that same year. :: Sky Views - Hammond Budget makes for dangerous cocktail The Treasury has undergone an unprecedented outreach programme, speaking to groups of Tory MPs to ensure they are consulted on ideas and on side over the plans. ""We've learnt a lot,"" said one Treasury source. The policies have been cross-checked with the manifesto, and to ensure ""watertight"" implementation. In each of the past three Budgets, the Conservatives have had to perform a U-turn on one of their top items, and that was at a time when the party had its own majority. ""It can't be a grandstanding big radical Budget - we wont reset the political economy of Britain in a Budget when you don't have a majority,"" said one influential Tory. ""But it will be a positive Budget - looking to the future of a fundamentally strong economy."" :: Quiz: How would you spend the Budget? DUP sources are expecting few surprises, having signed up to supporting the Conservatives in its Budget motions. The party was not formally involved in setting the Budget but has indicated policies it would and would not support. Some measures agreed in the confidence and supply agreement that kept Mrs May at Number 10 are expected to materialise today in some form - including reforms to VAT in the Northern Irish hospitality sector and air passenger duty on short-haul flights. Mr Hammond was supported by some Cabinet colleagues who spoke privately to Sky News. ""Philip has got a point of view that ought to be respected. He has the toughest job in Government,"" said one. An area of pain may be on diesel fuel, already criticised by the Government over pollution. One revenue-raising idea is to reduce the subsidies on ""red diesel"" for industrial use. Although farmers are expected to keep access to the cheap dyed fuel, the overall subsidy costs Â£2.3bn a year for a high pollutant that the Government is trying to phase out. Other pre-announced measures include a consultation over a tax on single-use plastics, a railcard for cheaper travel for 26 to 30-year-olds, and extra money for Northern Powerhouse rail connections. The biggest move could in fact be the result of a downgrade by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility to the expected productivity performance of the economy, after near stagnation for a decade since the financial crisis. This has a considerable impact on borrowing numbers, wiping out a better tax take this year. Mr Hammond will also have to face up to downgrades to the growth outlook with income-squeezed Britain now the slowest-growing G7 economy and the slowest-growing EU nation so far this year. Mr Hammond is also expected to provide funding to shorten a six-week wait for payments under Universal Credit by a week, after a number of Tory MPs expressed concerns. The Opposition has called for the Chancellor to abandon austerity, raise public sector pay and pause the Universal Credit programme."

The three spectators who died were 64-year-old Iain Provan, his partner Elizabeth Allan, 63, and 71-year-old Len Stern. They were hit when a vehicle, with Irish driver David Carney at the wheel, skidded off the road and ploughed into the crowd. The FAI also examined the death of 51-year-old Joy Robson at the Highland Snowman Rally bear Inverness in 2013. She was hit by a vehicle after it left the track. In her case, Sheriff Kenneth MacIver concluded: ""There are no reasonable precautions which I can identify whereby Mrs Robson's death or the accident causing her death could have been avoided."" In the case of the Jim Clark Rally, the sheriff found that the spot where the three spectators were killed should have been identified, in line with the organisers plan, so that it clearly prohibited spectators from standing anywhere near. In his determination, he said the deaths were down to ""no single person and no single circumstance"" but was due to a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances. He found that there had been an ""unlikely coincidence"" of errors and omissions in the event's organisation which had created a ""perfect storm"" that led to a disastrous consequence. Andrew Henderson, the solicitor representing Joy Robson's said: ""For Joy's children this was never about trying to stop rallying but rather to improve safety for the spectators. ""They always believed that the best way to do this was through the FAI process so that evidence could be properly evaluated and recommendations made. ""This is a very difficult time for them but they are absolutely resolute in their wish that no other family should ever go through the horror they have and that rallying is made as safe for its fans as it can possibly be."""
2017-11-22,A leading expert in embryo development has challenged the findings of a Government commissioned report into the pregnancy test drug Primodos.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/primodos-report-questionable-and-irresponsible-says-expert-11138448,"Neil Vargesson, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Medical Sciences in Aberdeen, describes some of the conclusions as ""questionable"" and ""irresponsible."" Campaigners have long argued that the hormone-based drug used by women in the 1960s and 1970s caused some babies to be born with severe birth defects. But a report published last week by the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) concluded that ""available scientific evidenceâ¦ does not support a causal association between the use of HPTs (hormone pregnancy tests), such as Primodos, during pregnancy and adverse outcomes"" such as malformations. In a letter to Sky News, Dr Vargesson says: ""I really don't think it is possible, with the current published evidence, to formally and directly conclude Primodos did not cause harm or imply that it was completely safe. ""Indeed, with the scientific data we currently have, can anyone really put their hand on their heart and confidently say that taking Primodos did not and would not cause damage to the embryo?"" His comments come as MPs from a cross-party group prepare to quiz members of the CHM about their conclusions. Last week, there was an urgent question in the Commons after Sky News revealed that the draft report had differed from the final publication in its conclusion. Campaigners also argued that the evidence had not been properly assessed and the expert group had veered from its original terms of reference. Some MPs described the report as ""a whitewash."" Dr Vargesson is the only expert to conduct recent studies on Primodos, finding that it can cause malformations to fish embryos. He challenges the CHM report's assertion that the findings should ""provide reassurance"" to women who today use some of the components of Primodos in high doses for other conditions and may fall pregnant inadvertently. He says: ""I find this a little questionable, if not somewhat irresponsible. The doses of noretheristerone acetate (a component of Primodos) used in these treatments are higher than the dose used in Primodos (10mg). ""Moreover, some of the scientific studies, that the working group considered flawed, actually showed that higher doses of these components of Primodos were harmful if not lethal to the embryo."" Dr Vargesson agrees with the CHM that many of the scientific studies available to assess were outdated and may have been flawed for a variety of reasons. However, he suggests that this should have prompted the committee to suggest further studies be conducted using modern techniques. Dr Vargesson notes: ""Some of these old studies do seem to indicate that Primodos exposure at least has the potential to cause damage or harm to the embryo. ""So I do remain a little surprised that the group concluded there is no causal link between Primodos and the causation of birth defects."" A spokesperson for Bayer AG, which acquired Primodos manufacturer Schering in 2006, said: ""Bayer notes that a review by an independent expert working group on hormone pregnancy tests of the Commission on Human Medicines has found, consistent with Bayer's view, based on all available data, that the scientific evidence does not support a causal association between the use of hormonal pregnancy tests, such as Primodos, and birth defects or miscarriage."""

The 75-year-old will be sworn in as president on Friday - two weeks after he was sacked as vice president by longtime ruler Robert Mugabe and fled to South Africa. Mr Mnangagwa said: ""I pledge myself to be your servant. I appeal to all genuine patriotic Zimbabweans to come together. We work together.

He referred to ""former president Robert Mugabe"" and said: ""The people have spoken. The voice of the people is the voice of God."" After emerging from hiding in South Africa, Mr Mnangagwa met with South African President Jacob Zuma and flew to Zimbabwe in a private jet. He then met other politicians and officials from ruling party ZANU-PF and was briefed on ""what has been happening in his absence"", chief whip Lovemore Matuke said. :: The huge challenges facing Zimbabwe's next leader Speaking to supporters outside the party headquarters, Mr Mnangagwa revealed he had been in constant contact with military leaders during his exile. He also praised the military and General Constantino Chiwenga, commander of Zimbabwe Defence Forces, for ""managing this process very peacefully"". Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal on 6 October plunged the country into a political crisis and prompted military chiefs to take control of the capital and place Mr Mugabe under house arrest. The 93-year-old initially refused to stand down, but tendered his resignation on Tuesday after impeachment proceedings were launched by the national parliament.

2017-11-22,Thomas Cook shares plunged 13% on opening after the holiday firm reported a series of costs had taken a toll on UK earnings.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/thomas-cook-shares-take-a-dive-as-uk-profits-fall-40-11138478,"The FTSE 250 firm said it was taking action to restore profitability after underlying UK earnings dived 40% - or by Â£34m - to Â£52m in its financial year to 30 September, despite a 3% increase in revenue. It had already flagged a tough second half and said it was not restricted to challenging trading in its tour operator division amid a price war for Spanish holidays. It said the weaker pound and rising hotel prices had contributed to weaker profit margins. Thomas Cook, like rivals, was forced to seek greater capacity in Spain this year because terrorism fears had knocked demand in its key growth markets of Egypt and Turkey. The company also pointed to a surge in costs from fraudulent illness claims and a big bill supporting 10,000 customers caught up in Hurricane Irma, which devastated parts of the Caribbean and the US state of Florida. Thomas Cook said: ""In response, our UK tour operator has implemented a set of actions to improve profitability. ""We have taken a robust approach towards illness claims including improving our handling and assessment processes, and taking legal action against fraudsters - as a result, the claim rate has declined dramatically. ""We are also rebalancing our destination mix towards more profitable, fast-growing destinations such as Turkey and Egypt, and we are continuing to drive operating efficiencies."" It said current trading was in line with expectations - with bookings up 1% in the UK - led by a return in demand for winter breaks in Egypt and the Canaries. The wider company had a better financial year - with profit before tax growing 12% to Â£46m. Peter Fankhauser, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said: ""2017 was a milestone year in the strategic development of Thomas Cook. ""By delivering what we promised on strategy, we've inspired more customers to choose our holidays for their hard-earned weeks in the sun."" He added: ""Looking to the year ahead, we can see real momentum in our Group Airline, and expect our Continental Europe and Northern Europe tour operator businesses to continue their good performance."""
2017-11-22,"The search for a missing Argentinian submarine has entered a ""critical phase"" as the crew's oxygen supply could be running low.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/ara-san-juan-critical-phase-as-missing-sub-runs-low-on-oxygen-11139542,"Dozens of planes and boats are searching for the ARA San Juan, which has been missing in the South Atlantic since 15 November with 44 crew on board. But the submarine has only seven days of oxygen and, if it has sunk or been unable to surface since it was last heard from, then it could be using the last of its supply. Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said: ""We are in the critical phase... particularly with respect to oxygen. ""There has been no contact with anything that could be the San Juan submarine. ""We are in a very dangerous situation and one that is getting worse."" As long as the 34-year-old, German-built submarine can reach the surface periodically to replenish its air, the crew could survive indefinitely, although there is nothing to indicate they have achieved this. Naval investigator Fernando Morales told Reuters: ""If the captain stayed at the bottom because he thought it was more prudent to stay at the bottom, it's one thing. ""But at this point we have to think that if he's at the bottom, it's because he could not emerge."" After a few days of good weather, searchers - including 30 boats and planes and personnel from the US, UK, Chile and Brazil - are expecting deteriorating conditions from Thursday. Mr Balbi revealed that a noise had been detected almost three hours after the submarine disappeared, near its last reported position. He described this as a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" but declined to say whether it indicated an explosion or emergency on the submarine. The noise is being analysed, he said, adding that it had to be ""corroborated and looked into"". Several possible signals, including sounds and flares, that were previously detected in the search turned out to be false alarms. Meanwhile, relatives of the crew member continue to wait at a naval base in Mar del Plata, as the case grips Argentina. The hashtags ""Los 44"" (The 44) and Enrique Balbi have become trending topics on Twitter and relatives have featured on newspaper front pages. ARA San Juan had been travelling from Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city, to Mar del Plata when it reported an electrical problem just before it vanished. The incident has brought criticism from some, including relatives of those missing, of the ageing equipment used by Argentina's armed forces."
2017-11-22,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

The force is already investigating a claim of of sexual assault made against Spacey which allegedly took place in the same area in 2008. A spokesperson did not identify the alleged attacker but confirmed the latest allegation, made on Friday, concerned the same man. ""It is alleged a man assaulted another man (Victim 1) in 2008 in Lambeth,"" the force said in a statement. ""On Friday November 17 a further allegation was made about the same man. The allegations are of sexual assaults against a man (Victim 2) in 2005 in Lambeth. ""Officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are investigating."" It comes after London's Old Vic theatre, where Spacey was artistic director from 2004 to 2015, said it had received 20 complaints of inappropriate behaviour by the Hollywood actor. It is not clear whether the investigation launched by Scotland Yard is a result of the Old Vic's report. The first allegation against Spacey was made by actor Anthony Rapp, who accused him of sexual assault. Spacey said he did ""not remember the encounter"" but offered ""the sincerest apology"" if it had taken place. He has not been charged with any crime. Netflix and Sony Pictures have cut ties with the star, cancelling his show House Of Cards and replacing him in an upcoming film."
2017-11-22,A former doctor for the US Olympic gymnastics team who is accused of molesting at least 125 girls and young women has pleaded guilty to multiple charges of sexual assault.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/ex-olympic-doctor-larry-nassar-admits-evil-abuse-of-child-gymnasts-11139400,"Larry Nassar admitted abusing seven girls - three of whom were under the age of 13 - at his home and at a clinic in Michigan. In some cases, the assaults he committed were under the guise of treatment, but the 54-year-old has confessed his conduct had no legitimate medical purpose. Some of the alleged abuse victims who have reported claims against Nassar include US Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas. Nassar, who lost his medical licence in April, now faces at least 25 years in prison - but the judge could set a minimum sentence as high as 40 years. At Ingham County Circuit Court in Michigan, Nassar said he was ""horribly sorry"" for the offences, which took place between 1998 and 2015. He added: ""This was like a match that turned into a forest fire out of control. ""I pray the rosary every day for forgiveness. I want them to heal. I want the community to heal."" During the hearing, victims testified that Nassar sexually abused them while they sought medical attention for gymnastics injuries. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said the disgraced doctor had used his position of trust ""in the most vile way to abuse children"". She added: ""I agree that now is a time of healing, but it may take them a lifetime of healing while you spend your lifetime behind bars thinking about what you did in taking away their childhood."" Judge Aquilina added that Nassar's victims were ""superheroes for all of America, because this is an epidemic"". Following the hearing, victim Rachael Denhollander said she was ""grateful for the army of women that has stopped a paedophile"". The former USA Gymnastics athlete added: ""(Nassar) is a consummate narcissist. He's a master manipulator. ""I don't believe there was anything sincere in what Larry said, other than his desire to refocus the attention on the good that he believed he did today."" Meanwhile, alleged victim Larissa Boyce said it was ""really hard"" to look at Nassar in the courtroom. ""This was a man we trusted. He's admitting what he did was wrong and evil."" Nassar is set to be sentenced on 12 January, and his 125 victims will be able to speak during that hearing. He has been charged with similar crimes in a neighbouring county, and is also awaiting sentencing in a federal court on child pornography charges."

Bronson, who was born Michael Peterson but is now called Charles Salvador after changing his name by deed poll in tribute to artist Salvador Dali, has earned public notoriety because of a history of violence both in and out of jail - including an attack on a prison governor in 2014. Since first going inside in 1974 for armed robbery, he has also taken 11 hostages and carried out nine rooftop sieges. A Parole Board spokesman said: ""We can confirm that a panel of the Parole Board has not directed the release of Charles Salvador.

Speaking to the Talk Radio, Williamson described her husband as a ""very kind compassionate soul"". ""Charlie has admitted his wrongdoings and he's served his time for every single offence that he's committed, and well over that time, and it's time now for him to move forward - he's an OAP,"" she said. ""I'm under no illusion. He's not going to be released any time soon. I know that and Charlie knows that, but he deserves the chance, like any other prisoner does, to progress."" Williamson, who said the parole hearing earlier this month was ""positive"" despite Tuesday's decision, has launched an online petition to give Bronson ""the chance to prove he is no longer 'Britain's most dangerous inmate'"". It has so far attracted more than 19,000 signatures."
2017-11-22,Parliament's close procedural combat over Brexit has begun in earnest. All-night sittings and all-out battles between and within parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/twin-tightropes-for-theresa-may-amid-mps-close-brexit-combat-11126950,"It began surreally enough, with Labour's backbench Brexiteer Frank Field arguing about the precise hour of Brexit. His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."

But they confirmed Multiyork would continue to trade as normal for the next few weeks as it looked to complete orders ahead of Christmas. The administrators said they were hopeful of finding a buyer for the business, which has 50 stores across the UK and a manufacturing facility in the Norfolk town of Thetford. The announcement came as fears grow that a squeeze on household budgets could tip some retailers over the edge following their most crucial Christmas trading period. Sky News reported last week how the womenswear chain Jigsaw was seeking a new buyer ahead of an anticipated ""cash pinch"". Multiyork's joint administrator, Allan Graham, said: ""Trading conditions for UK retailers continue to be difficult due to a number of factors including economic uncertainty, rising commodity prices, increasing business rates and the fall in value of the pound which has increased the cost of importing raw materials and products. ""This appears to be leading to a sharp fall in consumer confidence and less money being spent on discretionary items. ""The British Retail Consortium has been reporting that real consumer spending power has been on a downward trend in the last year as the acceleration in inflation has caused shoppers to become ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford. ""Many now face higher borrowing costs, given the rise in interest rates, which will only serve to heap further pressure onto household finances. ""This has impacted certain sectors particularly hard and as a result of trading losses, Multiyork could no longer meet on-going liabilities."" He asked customers waiting for orders to be patient, saying they would be contacted in due course."

Mr McLoughlin pledged to write to digital minister Matthew Hancock to suggest social media platforms like Facebook and Snapchat require any 13 to 18-year-olds to have a named parent on their application to open an account. ""Any parent's responsibility transcends any teenager's entitlement to privacy,"" Mr McLoughlin said. Ann Maguire was marking her 40th year teaching when she was stabbed to death in front of her class during a Spanish lesson at Corpus Christi School in Leeds, in 2014. In a tearful statement on Wednesday, her husband Don Maguire said the inquest's recommendations went further than the police and council in its response to the killing. ""They have gone where Leeds City Council, West Yorkshire Police, Leeds Safeguarding Children Board with its Learning Lessons review have failed to do so,"" he said. ""We want to understand because that's what Ann was about: to examine, to understand, and then to learn. ""We have to realise that we should not assume that we know what our kids know."" Ms Maguire's killer, 15-year-old Will Cornick, had posted on social media about his ""hatred"" for Mrs Maguire and talked about brutally killing her. But friends had not taken the threats seriously, saying that the teenager had a ""dark"" sense of humour. An official review into Mrs Maguire's death had previously judged that no-one should hold responsibility for the attack. ""What is clear to me is that no-one could have predicted or pre-empted Will Cornick's attack on Ann Maguire,"" independent reviewer Nick Page said. ""This was a unique event and there are no recommendations I can make which in hindsight could have assisted staff in predicting or preventing the murder ... or in preventing a similar event in the future."" The inquest, which finished on Wednesday, heard that the teacher ""stood absolutely no chance"" when she was stabbed seven times in the back by Cornick. The teenager ""was prone to say things that weren't true"", Detective Nick Wallen told the inquest. Leeds City Council have accepted the findings of the inquest, according to its head of children's services."

The aircraft both took off from Wycombe Air Park, also known as Booker Airfield, about 20 miles from the site of the collision. Air accident experts are still investigating after the aircraft came down over woodland near the Waddesdon Estate. Mr Nguyen was having helicopter flying training with veteran instructor Michael Green when they were hit by the plane, according to Vietnamese authorities.

According to local media reports, the party member, a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana, declared that the film would not be allowed to release at all after it was scheduled to open to audiences on 1 December. It has already been banned outright in two states. There are now growing security concerns for Padukone, one of India's biggest stars, who plays Rajput queen Padmavati in the film, based on a 16th century Sufi poem. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has since condemned the call for beheading and has asked Mr Amu to apologise. It comes as hardline Hindu fringe groups slammed the film and accused Sanjay Leela Bhansali's portrayal of distorting history by depicting the Muslim character, Alauddin Khilji, as the Hindu queen's ""lover"". The director was attacked on set in January by a Rajput group as some believe the queen chose to kill herself rather than accept the Muslim ruler's advances. Anil Jain, the head of the BJP's state unit in Haryana, which Mr Amu belongs to, said: ""We will not tolerate any violent remarks from our party members, but we also want the director to respect India's history."" The deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Keshav Prasad Maurya, said he would not allow the film to show in his state unless scenes showing the queen in a ""poor light"" were deleted. He said: ""How can a Muslim aggressor be portrayed as the real hero and the Hindu king and queen as victims? This is factually incorrect."" The head of the Central Board of Film Certification, Anurag Srivastava, said the producers' application to release the film was turned down because they did not clarify if the film was based on fact or fiction. The studio behind the $23m (Â£17m) production, Viacom18, said it ""voluntarily deferred"" the release date. A spokesperson said: ""We always have and are committed to continue following the established procedure and convention. We have faith that we will soon obtain the requisite clearances to release the film."" Police have since offered increased security to Padukone and Bhansali."

""Uber's announcement about a concealed data breach last October raises huge concerns around its data protection policies and ethics,"" said James Dipple-Johnstone, the deputy commissioner. ""Deliberately concealing breaches from regulators and citizens could attract higher fines for companies."" Uber announced that it had got rid of its chief security officer as it confirmed his team had not informed victims but instead paid off hackers who breached the company's systems in October 2016. Firms which operate in the UK can currently be fined up to Â£500,000 for failing to inform people if their data is stolen, which is an offence under the Data Protection Act. Under the EU's general data protection regulations, which the UK is enshrining in domestic law before Brexit, companies could face fines of Â£17m or 4% of their global turnover, whichever is higher. At the time the cover-up was revealed, the ride-hailing app's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said: ""None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it."" Mr Khosrowshahi, who joined the company in August, said: ""You may be asking why we are just talking about this now, a year later. ""I had the same question, so I immediately asked for a thorough investigation of what happened and how we handled it. ""While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes."" Uber's former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, learned of the hack in 2016, according to Bloomberg - seven months before a shareholder revolt forced him to quit. Uber has stated that it is in the process of notifying the relevant regulators, but has not issued further comment."
2017-11-22,Christmas shoppers are being warned they could become victims of fraud after a big leap in incidents during the last festive season.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/police-warn-christmas-shoppers-about-sharp-rise-in-fraud-11139534,"Shopping fraud rose by a quarter last Christmas, with most victims targeted on online marketplace sites, police have said. Victims reported losing almost Â£16m in total, a rise of 45% on the previous year. City of London Police Commander Dave Clark said: ""Christmas is a busy time of year when we are required to make several quick decisions, especially when it comes to present buying. ""Our fraud awareness campaign is highlighting that it is very much 'the thought that counts', especially when it comes to avoiding fraudsters. ""Fraudsters see the Christmas rush as an ideal opportunity to take advantage of people's generosity without a single care about the consequences this may cause for the victim. â¨â¨""With a sharp rise in fraud reporting at Christmas time it is more important than ever that people do everything they can to protect themselves from fraudsters, stopping them from enjoying the holiday season at the expense of others."" On the force's Action Fraud website, 15,243 people reported a shopping fraud, while 9,932 of them said they were defrauded online. It's estimated there are around 300 marketplace sites in Europe - the best known are eBay and Amazon - where goods are sold by retailers and individuals. Chris Dawson, who runs the online advice blog tamebay.com, explained how fraudsters use phishing emails to lure victims onto bogus marketplace sites. He said: ""Recently I received a phishing email which purportedly was from Amazon, but it wasn't from Amazon, it was pretending to be. ""It was an attempt by scammers to get me to click on an email and give away my personal information. ""It had a big link saying 'click here to sign into your Amazon account'. ""If you clicked that link on this spam email it would take you to a site where they would ask you to enter your name and your bank information."" Action Fraud said mobile phones were the most likely purchase from fraudsters, followed by clothing and accessories, shoes, computers and home electronics. eBay said in a statement: ""The vast majority of purchases made through eBay's marketplace go through with no problems at all. ""However, if your item doesn't arrive or wasn't what was described in the listing, we'll make sure that you get the item you ordered or a refund if you paid using PayPal. ""Our money back guarantee covers billions of pounds' worth of purchases each year and ensures that buyers can shop confidently, with knowledge that they will receive the item they purchased or their money back."" Harry Rose, Which? Money Editor, said: ""Our recent investigation showed how easy it is for fraudsters to send spoofed texts, pretending to be someone that they are not. ""Consumers must be extra vigilant this Black Friday and think twice before clicking on the link in any unsolicited messages."""

That figure of Â£92.50 per megawatt hour agreed with the Â£20bn plant's operator EDF would add between Â£10 to Â£15 to the average annual electricity bill for consumers up to 2030, the report said. It noted that would disproportionately affect the poorest households. The report said the value for money case for supporting Hinkley was further damaged by a Department for Business forecast that consumers will now pay Â£30bn in top-up payments over the contract's 35 years - five times more than the estimate in 2013. The committee also raised fears on whether the project would be completed on time - potentially damaging the country's energy security. EDF admitted in July that it was facing a 15-month delay to the 2025 schedule for the start of power generation. Once completed, the plant is tasked with providing 7% of the country's electricity needs. The report said: ""The other projects using the same reactor technology as Hinkley Point C - in France, Finland and China - have seen significant cost and schedule overruns. ""Brexit could also have implications for the project due to withdrawal from Euratom, the pan-European atomic energy regulator, and the risk of people with nuclear engineering and science skills moving abroad."" The committee's chair, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said: ""Bill-payers have been dealt a bad hand by the Government in its approach to this project. ""Its blinkered determination to agree the Hinkley deal, regardless of changing circumstances, means that for years to come energy consumers will face costs running to many times the original estimate. ""The Government made some grave strategic errors here and must now explain what it will do to ensure these are not repeated."" A Business Department spokesman said: ""The Government negotiated a competitive deal for the construction of the first new nuclear power station in a generation as part of our energy mix, which ensures consumers won't pay a penny for any construction overruns and until the station generates electricity in 2025. ""There are already 2,400 people employed on site in Somerset and the project will create over 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships in the UK nuclear supply chain. ""On Monday we will publish our Industrial Strategy setting out how we will help young people develop the skills to benefit from the high-paid, high-skilled jobs of the future."" EDF Energy said in a statement: ""The cost of Hinkley Point C for customers has not changed and they will pay nothing for its reliable, low carbon electricity until the station is completed. ""EDF and its co-investor CGN take the risk of increased costs during construction. ""The agreed price is lower than 80% of other low carbon capacity contracted so far and the project has restarted UK nuclear construction after a quarter century. ""Construction is fully under way and is already delivering a huge benefit to British jobs, skills and industrial strategy."""

2017-11-22,American Airlines and United Airlines have agreed to a $95.1m (Â£71.9m) settlement with the developer of the Twin Towers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/american-and-united-airlines-settle-with-developer-over-911-terror-attacks-11138661,"The commercial carriers' agreement to the payout to World Trade Center Properties, owned by developer Larry Silverstein, puts an end to a 13-year litigation. In total, nearly 3,000 people were killed in the 9/11 terror attacks, which were claimed by al Qaeda and its then leader Osama bin Laden. Just six weeks before the attacks, Mr Silverstein had signed a 99-year lease for the site, which is jointly owned by New York and New Jersey. The airlines' insurers are understood to be covering the cost of the payout. Mr Silverstein has already received a $4.55bn (Â£3.4bn) payout from his own insurers, six years after the attack. The latest settlement must now be approved by Alvin Hellerstein, the district judge overseeing the majority of civil litigation stemming from the attacks. The property developer had initially sought $12.3bn (Â£9.3bn) from the airlines and airport security companies. Two years ago, Silverstein Properties won an appeal which found that the judge had underestimated the company's losses due to the attacks. The final payment would have totalled $97m, but was reduced when two of American and United's insurers become insolvent during the case. Silverstein Properties said they were ""pleased to have finally reached a resolution"". American Airlines, who themselves lost 23 employees and family members, said they would ""never forget that terrible day and its lasting impact"". United Airlines declined to comment. More than 2,750 died when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the North and South World Trade Center towers. A hijacked American Airlines flight crashed into the Pentagon just outside Washington DC, killing 187 people. A fourth airliner, United 93, was also taken over and believed to be heading for Washington DC, but it crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers and crew tried to regain control. Silverstein opened a rebuilt One World Trade Center - the tallest building in New York and the sixth tallest in the world - in November 2014."
2017-11-22,Philip Hammond is facing questions from Labour on his Budget stamp duty cut for first-time buyers and from Tory Eurosceptics on proposed payments to Brussels after Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171123070750/https://news.sky.com/story/hammond-facing-budget-backlash-from-mps-over-stamp-duty-gimmick-and-eu-payments-11139538,"Labour MPs are challenging the Chancellor over claims by the Government's own Budget watchdog, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), that the stamp duty cut will push up house prices. Some Labour backbenchers have also dismissed the stamp duty cut as a ""gimmick"" which will help young professionals in London but do nothing for people in areas where property prices are low. Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Conservative MPs are demanding answers from Mr Hammond about OBR forecasts suggesting the UK will pay the European Union Â£3.5bn in the year after Brexit. The Chancellor will be challenged on these and other issues - such as his failure to lift the public sector pay cap - in a round of post-Budget breakfast TV and radio interviews. :: Autumn Budget 2017 - The key points at a glance Later, shadow chancellor John McDonnell will launch Labour's fightback when he opens day two of the four-day Budget debate in the Commons, when pro-Brexit Tories will query the Brussels cash. Mr Hammond was cheered loudly in the Commons by Tory MPs - and again when he addressed them at a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee - for his stamp duty cut. He is abolishing stamp duty altogether for first-time buyer purchases up to Â£300,000, and on the first Â£300,000 of the purchase price of properties worth up to Â£500,000. In his initial response to the Budget, Jeremy Corbyn told MPs: ""We back the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers because it was another Labour policy at the election, not a Tory one."" But then the OBR said in its 258-page Budget breakdown: ""First-time buyers purchasing a property over Â£500,000 will not be eligible for this relief, and will therefore face the same marginal stamp duty rates on the first Â£500,000 as before."" And in a prediction that was seized on by Labour MPs, the OBR said: ""We expect this to increase house prices by 0.3%."" :: Analysis - Hammond buys Government out of strife... for now Former shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves, who chairs the all-party Business Select Committee, told MPs the housing measures in the Budget were ""the exact opposite from what we need if we want to ensure that more young people and more families can get on the housing ladder"". John Mann, who chairs the Treasury sub-committee, said the average house price in his Bassetlaw constituency in Nottinghamshire was about Â£135,000 - just above the Â£125,000 threshold for stamp duty payments. He added: ""Few first-time buyers have the means to afford properties costing up to Â£300,000. ""Very few first-time buyers at all are buying properties costing that much in the North. ""I'm sure this little boost will help young professionals in London, but for those working hard in ordinary jobs in my area it doesn't address the root cause of problems for first-time buyers. ""More affordable homes and decent, stable jobs to allow people to save for them are the way to tackle the housing crisis. ""Today's announcement on stamp duty is little more than a gimmick."" :: Corbyn - Britain 'let down' by Government The challenge to the Chancellor over post-Brexit cash payments to Brussels was raised in the Commons Budget debate by the Eurosceptic Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. He said he suspected Treasury forecasts suggesting Britain would pay the EU Â£3.5bn in a year following Brexit must be an error. Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs he had spotted figures in Budget documents outlining an ""own resources contribution"" to the EU in 2022/23. ""This is rather like spotting an error in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, something that is very rare to do and indicates an occasional failing that I hope will be put right and we will discover that this is not intended,"" he said. ""Because if it is, it means we won't in fact be stopping our contributions to the European Union, and that would be very strange. ""And to have them described as own resources is even more peculiar, because that assumes we are still members, so I think there is an error there."" :: What was missing from the Budget? Mr Hammond's deputy, Treasury chief secretary Liz Truss, told Mr Rees-Mogg: ""Those forecasts are made by the OBR. ""The OBR were provided with the Prime Minister's Florence speech, the basis on which we are negotiating with the EU. It is up to them to make their own independent forecasts."" :: Shadow chancellor John McDonnell will be interviewed live on Sky News Sunrise at 7.10am, followed by Chancellor Philip Hammond at 7.20am."

Two lab staff have been arrested and five others questioned as part of a criminal investigation which has been running since February. The alleged tampering involved the manipulation of data from blood samples by staff at Randox Testing Services in Manchester. Three-quarters of the investigations potentially affected involve traffic offences, such as drug-driving, though the rest include 274 homicide and 900 rape cases. In some of the cases that have been stopped, there was no sample available for retesting, or the quality or quantity of the sample was too small. However, retesting in the most serious cases has so far found no evidence of tampering, said the NPCC's James Vaughan. He said 70% of the planned retesting - involving all but one of Britain's police forces - had been completed and the rest would be finished by summer next year. Randox Testing Services said it had alerted police to the alleged tampering and was supporting the investigation by Greater Manchester Police. The company said it was funding the costs of retesting. A spokesperson said: ""We will do all that we can to ensure this situation is resolved and deeply regret the distress that has been caused. ""We are now well advanced in developing a foolproof testing system which would enhance the security of our operations in the future, to provide the necessary level of confidence."" Potential tampering is being investigated at a second company, Trimega Laboratories, where the two arrested suspects also worked. Trimega deals with child protection and family court cases. Gillian Tully, of the Forensic Services Regulator, said all major forensic toxicology suppliers had been asked to carry out a detailed audit of a sample of their cases to ensure the issue is not more widespread. The audits uncovered no such data manipulation. ""If there was large-scale manipulation going on across the board I do expect it would have been found during that audit,"" she said."

Downloading the material also uncovered a man's face, and detectives want to question him about the device. Explaining why an appeal is taking place so long after the device was found, a Met Police spokesman said: ""The investigation involved time-consuming submissions of the device to the lab, for forensics and then for a full download of the device.

The haul comprised of 110 real and 353 imitation firearms, and 5,849 related items such as pepper sprays, gun parts and stun weapons. All were seized from across air, rail and sea ports. Rifles, shotguns, handguns, automatic and semi-automatic weapons are all classed as firearms by the Home Office, as are pepper sprays, high-voltage electric stun guns, high-powered air rifles and tear gas. A spokesman for the department, which disclosed the figures on Thursday, said: ""The UK has some of the toughest gun laws in the world and we are determined to keep it that way. ""As well as making physical checks on arriving luggage and cargo, Border Force works with their fellow law enforcement agencies, using intelligence and advanced technology, to detect and stop dangerous weapons at the border."" A number of legal requirements have to be met to lawfully import firearms and ammunition into the UK. Prospective owners must be assessed by the police as not posing a threat to public safety and having good reason to own a firearm, with anyone who has been jailed for three years or more barred from having one at any time. Organisations such as shooting clubs, museums and firearms dealers must also apply for licences. ""Applicants should be able to demonstrate to the licensing authority that they require their firearm on a regular, legitimate basis for work, sport or leisure (including collections or research),"" Home Office guidelines state. ""Chief Officers are able to exercise discretion over what constitutes a good reason, judging each case on its own merits."" The number of other forbidden items seized at ports has also seen a sizeable increase in the last year, including so-called zombie knives, which were banned in August 2016, and knuckledusters, which are both classed as ""offensive weapons"". Around 10,935 such items were seized in 2016/17, up from 8,931 in 2015/16. The haul came from both ""targeted operations and routine searches"".

I can't tell you how I felt when I helped liberate an IS brothel, where girls as young as nine were kept chained to the ground. I wept when I realised it was empty, hours earlier the girls had been packed into cars and driven south. All I could do was walk hopelessly amongst the dirty mattresses and chains, praying that we'll find them soon. We have all been exposed to the IS's vile propaganda. The group's ability to harness social media has been unprecedented. No terror group in history has been able to reach directly into people's homes, spreading both fear and their twisted ideology. IS spends millions of dollars and thinks very carefully about the new depths of depravity their propaganda can sink too. The group has always been erratic but its message of hate has always been consistent. It's this consistent message that makes the IS foreign fighter - particularly those from the West - so incredibly dangerous. These people have had every opportunity in life, they have grown up in places like Britain in both comfort and security. Despite the education and opportunity afforded to them, they have decided to abandon the West and pursue jihad in Syria. They knew exactly what the Islamic State was, yet still decided to go. Now these jihadist fighters are begging to return to Britain. Long gone is their arrogance as they burned their passports and planned horrible attacks on the UK. They now claim to be disillusioned and deeply regretful. Let's be absolutely clear, had it not been for the collapse of IS these men and women would not be coming back. They now face a stark choice, die a miserable death in Syria or try to return to Britain. Many are now choosing to play the system - after all, they know how difficult it is to prosecute them. Most can simply claim to have ""sat in a house for years"" or to have been ""stuck in IS territory"" because of their naivety. In reality, many are as fanatical as when they left. If we throw in years of military training and indoctrination, it's clear that these people present an extreme threat to the UK. What message would it send our friends and enemies if we allow these people back? More than anything it could actually encourage jihadists. Britain would appear to be a ""safe haven"" for those running from their violent escapades abroad. We must never allow this to happen. Britain must cut all ties with citizens that have burned their passports and declared themselves loyal to IS. They should be arrested if they can somehow get to our borders or onto the British mainland. Other than that, these men and women should be left to their fate in the Middle East. I have seen with my own eyes what these people have done and what they are capable of. It was their choice to pursue a life of violence and murder. It is not Britain's responsibility to bring them back. :: Families of British jihadi fighters: 'We're the forgotten victims'"

2017-11-23,Analysis of the Budget has found families are now projected to be at the start of the longest period of disposable income decline in more than 60 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171124075614/https://news.sky.com/story/britain-on-course-for-longest-fall-in-living-standards-11139742,"The Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on how to bolster living standards, said Philip Hammond's speech painted a bleak outlook as the country gets to grips with a slowing economy linked to Brexit. Its downbeat tone was mirrored in a separate study of the Budget small print by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It suggested the UK was on course for two decades of lower earnings growth, rather than just one following the 2008 crash, and also calculated that national debt may not return to pre-financial crisis levels until the 2060s or later. As well as the Budget, both organisations used updated forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to compile their findings. The foundation said they showed the economy was on course to be Â£42bn smaller in 2022 compared with the projections in March. The organisation calculated individual disposable incomes would be Â£540 lower in 2023 than was being forecast in March, while annual pay would be down around Â£1,000. Commenting on the impact on living standards, it said: ""The current income squeeze is set to be longer (though shallower) than the post-crash squeeze, with real household disposable incomes set to fall for an unprecedented 19 successive quarters between 2015 and 2020. :: Autumn Budget: the key points at a glance ""Despite welcome but relatively small shifts on Universal Credit, tax and benefit policies announced since [the] summer Budget [of] 2015 are set to put downward pressure on living standards and upward pressure on inequality. ""The poorest third of households are set for an average loss of Â£715 a year by the end of the parliament, while the richest third gain an average of Â£185."" In terms of the public finances, it claimed the Chancellor ""had all but abandoned"" his aim of achieving a budget surplus by the middle of the next decade because of extra spending and borrowing. The report welcomed his focus on housing, but criticised the stamp duty measures for first-time buyers. The tax is now removed for purchases up to Â£300,000 and on the first Â£300,000 of the purchase price of properties worth up to Â£500,000. :: Chancellor criticised for stamp duty 'gimmick' But the foundation said it would cost Â£160,000 for every additional home owner created, ""sufficient for the Chancellor to have instead simply given people typically priced properties in over a quarter of local authorities in England and Wales"". IFS director Paul Johnson told reporters that boosting productivity was key to alleviating economic headwinds facing the country. ""The UK is currently growing more slowly than other advanced economies. ""The immediate effects of all this on households is already being felt. Real earnings are falling this year as inflation has risen to 3%. ""The nascent recovery in earnings, which were growing through 2014 to the first half of 2016, has been choked off. ""That they even might still be below their 2008 level in 2022 as the OBR forecasts is truly astonishing. Let's hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic."" Mr Hammond used an interview with Sky News on Thursday to address some of the issues raised in the reports. Responding to claims his stamp duty measures will push up prices, he said the Government's efforts to accelerate building would boost supply and help bring prices down. He also denied any suggestion Britain was now the 'sick man of Europe' given the OBR's productivity and wider growth downgrades, suggesting eurozone nations were now catching up after lagging UK growth since the recession."

It Is a compilation of reports from Irish embassies based across Europe in early November. According to the document, Mr Davis barely mentioned Brexit in a meeting with the French foreign and defence ministers - viewed as a wasted opportunity. In another meeting, a Czech minister called Mr Johnson ""unimpressive"", but noted that he had at least ""avoided any gaffes"" during a visit in September. The country's deputy minister for foreign affairs, Jakub Durr, told colleagues ""he felt sorry for British ambassadors around the EU trying to communicate a coherent message when there is political confusion at home"". While the British judge in the European Court of Justice, Ian Forrester, bemoaned ""the quality of politicians in Westminster"". He wondered if Britons would view Brexit as a ""great mistake"" when they realised what it entailed. And senior EU figures were reportedly alarmed by ""chaos in the Conservative Government"", claiming ministers and civil servants were unable to agree on Brexit policies. The document also revealed member states believed it would be difficult to break a deadlock in negotiations by December, preventing talks moving on to trade. Theresa May told MPs in October: ""I have a degree of confidence that we will be able to get to the point of sufficient progress by December. Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said in Parliament that the leaked report ""paints a rather unflattering picture of the UK Government's negotiating skills"". He asked for a debate on ""the Government's incompetence and inability to deliver Brexit"". Commons leader Andrea Leadsom accused Mr Brake of ""talking the country down"". The Prime Minister's spokesman said: ""I don't comment on leaked documents. The Government is working hard on preparations for Brexit."" ""There is good and constructive working relationship with the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister]."" The Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin has declined to comment."
2017-11-23,A report has raised fears 13 million households could be paying more than they should for home insurance because they have failed to shop around.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171124075614/https://news.sky.com/story/loyalty-penalty-for-home-insurance-customers-citizens-advice-11141034,"Citizens Advice found almost a third of the country's homes have remained with the same provider for more than five years, meaning they were potentially paying 70% more than a new customer would for a policy. The free financial advice service described that as a ""loyalty penalty"" for customers - most of them elderly - saying there were average savings of Â£110 annually for people with the cheapest form of buildings and contents cover. It issued the own-goal alert to bill payers at a crucial time for household budgets amid a continuing squeeze from rising inflation and lacklustre wage growth. The study also took aim at companies, saying some did not fully comply with rules requiring them to clearly state the past year's premium at renewal - allowing them to often get away with rises in premiums. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""Home insurance companies are taking advantage of people's loyalty, and it's older people who are suffering the most. ""The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) must stop home insurance providers overcharging customers. ""Vulnerable customers are the hardest hit and must be protected from this unfair practice."" James Bridge, head of conduct regulation at the Association of British Insurers, responded: ""Many customers benefit from shopping around to get the right policy for their needs at the best price, taking advantage of what are in effect introductory discounts. ""We recognise, however, that in a competitive market, those that don't shop around may not always get the best deal. ""This is why we pushed for the new rules on renewal notices displaying both the existing and new premium to prompt customers, including the over-65s, to think about shopping around. ""The FCA has identified that some firms have had implementation challenges with the new rules and we would expect them to work with the regulator to put them right."""
2017-11-23,A new way of treating the most common form of childhood cancer has pushed five-year survival rates above 90%.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171124075614/https://news.sky.com/story/leukaemia-sufferers-hopeful-over-new-treatment-11140980,"Around 400 children are diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia every year and trials have improved the accuracy of predicting a relapse. Professor Anthony Moorman from Newcastle University told Sky News: ""What this study shows is that if you integrate two of the major risk factors, principally treatment response and also the underlying genetic make-up of the leukaemia, you can really tailor your risk factor analysis much more precisely and identify patients who are at least risk of relapse and hence can be considered for treatment de-intensification or at least spared treatment intensification."" Oscar Howard-Hull, a seven-year-old from Derby, took part in the study after being diagnosed with leukaemia in 2015. At times, Oscar's treatment has left him unable to walk. Oscar's mother Kimberley welcomed the findings, saying: ""It's really hard to think you're in this situation, you need the medication to get better but that medication is making them poorly at the same time in other ways. ""To think that going forward other families might not have to go through those massive hurdles of their children being unwell as a side effect of medication is really amazing, really great."" But campaigners warned there is still much more to do. Cliff O'Gorman lost his brother and sister to leukaemia 30 years ago. His charity Children with Cancer UK helped fund the study. ""Children and young people diagnosed with cancer face aggressive treatments that can have a long-term impact on their health and well-being,"" he said. ""It is crucial that we build on this breakthrough and continue to fund further studies and clinical trials to develop kinder, more effective treatment for young cancer patients in the UK."" The outlook is currently poorer for children who relapse, with fewer than six in 10 surviving longer than five years. For others the highly toxic treatment can affect fertility and cause heart problems in later life. Oscar is due to complete chemotherapy in October 2018 - when he plans to fully concentrate on pursuing his dream of becoming a professional footballer."

Thomas Evans, 25, from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, converted to Islam before leaving the UK in 2012. Three years later, he was killed as al Shabab fighters exchanged fire with soldiers in Kenya. Mr Evans told Sky News that the years after his brother joined up with the terror group were extremely difficult for him and his family. ""It was really difficult because people knew Tom round here. When they asked where he was, how do you tell them? How do you say your brother's a terrorist? It's not something you can really say. ""I didn't choose to go through this. I was a victim of circumstance. If I can use what I've learned over the past five years to help just one family, then I'll feel like I've done my job."" :: British jihadis 'should not be allowed to return home' Mr Evans will be working alongside a small group from the counter-extremism charity Faith Matters, offering practical help, advice and support, not just to the families of jihadis but to relatives of right-wing extremists as well. Mr Evans' mother, Sally, said that for years she simply did not tell anyone about her other son's descent into extremism. Mrs Evans said she was deeply traumatised by the death of Thomas, who changed his name to Abdul Hakim on converting to Islam. ""I'm still very emotional over Thomas. I don't know how I'll ever... I'll always miss him. ""In life, I just sort of carry on. Well you have to don't you, you just have to get up and carry on."" The mother of another British jihadi, killed in a drone strike in Syria, said the families of extremists were the forgotten victims, often shunned by communities back home in the UK. Khadijah Kamara, whose son Ibrahim left to fight in Syria four years ago, said she suffered years of verbal abuse and isolation in her home town of Brighton. The 19-year-old had travelled out to Syria in late 2013, after joining three Brighton brothers to fight for Jabhat al Nusra, an al Qaeda affiliate. His mother, who runs a small charity shop in Brighton, said her mental health suffered after her son's death. ""When I lost my son, I didn't know where to turn to. I had a breakdown. ""I just want people to know that we exist, we feel pain. We are as shocked as other people are and this was as unexpected for us as it was for everyone else."" Breaking down in tears the mother of three, originally from Sierra Leone, said: ""It shouldn't be like that. It shouldn't be like that. We do feel pain, we miss them. It shouldn't be like that and adding more to our wounds is not fair."" The rise and now rapid demise of extremist groups, like Islamic State, has left many families in the UK suffering a double trauma: having to come to terms with the loss of a loved one, as well as facing up to the fact that loved one was also a terrorist. Mr Evans' new support group aims to offer them at least some comfort and help."

Venables was previously returned to jail in 2010 for downloading and distributing dozens of indecent images of children. In a statement read out by a friend, Mrs Fergus went on to say she felt the probation service have been ""trying to keep this quiet"". ""What hurts me most,"" she said, ""is the way the probation service has tried to cover this up. ""Venables was taken back into custody a week ago, yet I was only informed hours before it hit the press."" She said the late notice has left her feeling extremely upset, angry and insulted.

It said: ""We want to reassure Mrs Fergus and Mr Bulger that a liaison officer will continue to stay in regular contact with them as the case progresses."" Venables, now in his 30s, was detained after the images were discovered during a routine check at his home by probation officials, The Sun reported. He was originally jailed for life alongside 10-year-old classmate Robert Thompson for the abduction, torture and murder of two-year-old James in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993. The two boys were released on licence with new identities in 2001. Venables went on to offend again, including arrests for affray and possession of cocaine in 2008. In 2010, he was jailed for two years after pleading guilty to downloading images of child abuse. Venables, who was reportedly given a second new identity after his first alias was revealed, was granted parole in 2013. :: James Bulger killer Venables 'still a danger' A post on the James Bulger Memorial Trust's Facebook page encouraged people to leave messages of support for Mrs Fergus.

Some 44 people are on board and the operation has entered a ""critical phase"" because the crew's oxygen supply could be running low. Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said relatives of the crew members have been told about the development and the search will continue until the fate of the crew is known. He described the blast, which was detected around the same time that the submarine sent its last signal last week, as ""abnormal, singular, short, violent"" and ""non-nuclear"". Mr Balbi added there was no sign the explosion was linked to any attack on the vessel. Britain's Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson offered ""sincerest condolences"" to Argentina, saying: ""When it comes to situations like this, nationality doesn't matter: all sailors have an obligation to help each other in a time of such desperate need. ""I'm extremely proud of the role our Navy and Air Force have played in the international effort to help, and I speak on behalf of those involved, and the whole country, in offering our sincerest condolences to Argentina and the family and friends of the crew."" More than a dozen ships and planes are involved in the multinational search, with search teams combing an area of some 185,000 square miles, roughly the size of Spain. Earlier, the United States said an object detected by its navy close to where the submarine sent its last signal was not the missing sub. The search is taking on an increasing sense of urgency as experts worry that if the ARA San Juan is intact but submerged, its crew might only have enough oxygen to last another seven to 10 days. The crew could survive indefinitely if the 34-year-old German-built submarine is able to reach the surface periodically to replenish its air, but there is nothing to indicate this is a possibility. Relatives of the crew continue to wait at a naval base in Mar del Plata, as the case grips Argentina. The hashtags ""Los 44"" (The 44) and Enrique Balbi have become trending topics on Twitter and relatives have featured on the front of newspapers in the country. The submarine had been travelling from Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city, to Mar del Plata when it reported an electrical problem just before it vanished."
2017-11-23,"Look around you today, and witness an outbreak of furtive shopping.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171124075614/https://news.sky.com/story/why-britain-has-embraced-black-friday-11140698,"People at work, on the train or maybe sitting opposite you in the living room, all looking at a screen, spending time on spending money. Today is Black Friday, a retail event that didn't even exist in this country a few years ago but now seems to have turned into a relentless machine. In shops and online, we are expected to spend around Â£3bn over the next few days. Black Friday, after all, doesn't actually stop until Sunday or Monday. Yes, it's a bit gaudy and no, not every retailer joins in. Marks and Spencer, for instance, have made a point of avoiding this carnival of cost-cutting, but every year, more people do seem to get involved. Today, you'll see special deals at stores ranging from Poundland to John Lewis, which rather suggests that Black Friday is here to stay. But why? Why would retailers decide to embrace all this, offering huge discounts in the run-up to Christmas, traditionally the time when we all dig into our savings for an annual shopping splurge? Why, to use a rather vivid metaphor, would shops cannibalise their own sales? To discover the answer, you have to cast your mind back to the financial crisis and then gently scroll forward. In the years that followed, Britain's economy was helped by consumer spending. British shoppers, to put it bluntly, kept on opening their wallets, and Britain's retailers kept finding things to sell to them. The competitive nature of that was fierce - just look at food price deflation or the collapse of BHS as evidence of that - but our best retailers are all still there. Into that pot came tumbling the explosive expansion of online shopping. The internet delivered three strands: traditional retailers who found a new way of selling goods, pure online companies such as ASOS or Ocado, and then Amazon - a company worth Â£418bn at last count, but which is younger than Ariana Grande, and sells just about everything, to just about everyone. British retailers found themselves battling to understand how to combat Amazon, and also how to keep us all spending money. And then, Black Friday tumbled into their laps, offering an opportunity. Black Friday was already an American institution, heralding a shopping splurge after Thanksgiving, and it was brought here by Walmart, an American company. But the Brits have embraced it - retail giants such as Dixons Carphone commission special Black Friday products a year in advance while the list of special deals is long and detailed. Yes, some of them are things they're trying to get rid of anyway, and yes, some of them were probably available at a discount price a few months back anyway. But few now doubt that there are bargains to be had out there. This is an important Christmas period. Retail sales have been weak over the past few six months and plenty of retailers I speak to paint a picture that is tougher even than official statistics suggest. Some say their focus is pretty much entirely on survival, rather than growth and they worry that the likes of Amazon are selling products for below-cost, creating prices that are impossible to beat on a regular basis. Black Friday gives them a chance to grab back our attention. And curiously, it seems that this doesn't ruin Christmas sales - only one in five Black Friday sales are Christmas presents. Mostly, it's people treating themselves to a bargain purchase, and mostly they're doing it online. Only 20% of Black Friday shopping is done in an actual shop. That's why you're going to see so many people studying screens over the next couple of days, adding to the billions that we spend over a weekend. That leaves other, pressing questions - if more shopping is now being done online, and if young people assume all transactions are done online by default, what are the consequences for physical shops, for delivery companies, automation and retail employment? These could end up being crucial questions for the UK economy - something to ponder as you wait at the online checkout."
2017-11-23,It's not difficult to detect a spring in the step of David Davis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171124075614/https://news.sky.com/story/will-the-smile-ever-leave-brexit-secretary-davis-davis-face-11123576,"Despite the fact that he is the man responsible not just for extricating us from the European Union but fashioning our future relationship, he is clearly enjoying being back on the front line of British politics. As much as anything else, that's probably because he didn't expect to be. But thrust into the fray, and despite the gravity of the task at hand, he is revelling in the role. None of which assumes that things are going well, of course. Despite his claim that ""huge progress"" is being made, there is an arbitrary timescale of a fortnight set by Michel Barnier to come up with more money - not that Mr Davis recognises that as a deadline he needs to stick to. Just that by the December meeting of the European Council sufficient concessions need to be made to persuade the EU27 to move on to the phase-two trade talks. But if - and in a world of big ifs this is perhaps the most sizeable - they decide that sufficient progress has not been made, there's no chance of getting to grips with trade talks until the end of quarter one next year. Even ten months to agree the most complicated deal in the nation's history seems on the short side. And of course it's not just trade: there are myriad other agreements that will need to discussion, particularly if - as seems increasingly likely - we leave the EU without a deal. Still, the Brexit Secretary confirmed, as if confirmation were necessary. that the Government is planning for just that eventuality. ""Don't assume we are not planning for every contingency,"" he told me. :: Brexit can be reversed - Article 50 architect It's worth remembering that we were told that ""of course"" a deal would be done. Now, so much of the conversation around Brexit rests on the sticking points in the talks. Take the Northern Irish border. If there's no deal, surely the only two options are that part of the UK remaining in the customs union (entirely unpalatable to the DUP and others), or a hard border (unpalatable to pretty much everyone). There are solutions, I was told. What they are, I was not. My eyebrows shot up at Mr Davis' contention that planes would of course fly the day after Brexit in a ""no deal"" situation; it was of course his Chancellor who raised the prospect. :: Farage set for Â£150k EU exit payout I'm regularly surprised by the number of politicians who simply don't understand that when trying to bring public opinion with you, it is almost as much how you say it, as what you say. David Davis is not one of those. Confident, self-assured, dare I say a bit of a charmer. But the public are engaging in the analysis of these talks as never before. Will the smile ever leave the Secretary of State's face? It's certainly difficult to imagine. This is a politician clearly revelling in the task at hand - but it's a task that's far from complete. The fact that the Government will not countenance a pause to the Article 50 process - in effect pushing back the date at which we leave the European Union - seems entirely motivated by domestic political concerns. After all, if in the eleventh hour of the negotiations an end is in sight, why wouldn't we want a little more time?"

He has since been treated at Ajou University Hospital in Suwon, where doctors worked for days to remove shards of four bullets in his body and treat pre-existing conditions, including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and a case of massive intestinal worms. Lee Guk-jong, who leads the team treating the soldier, said the defector has been introduced to Western culture and showed a particular liking for blockbuster films Transporter 3, Bruce Almighty and TV series CSI. Mr Lee said: ""We are mainly showing him movie channels on TV, and he really likes American movies."" The surgeon added that he played the soldier three versions of a South Korean girl band song. ""I asked him which version he liked the most, and he said he liked the original version the most,"" Mr Lee said. ""He likes female idol groups a lot. The other two bands (who sing different versions of the song) are all men."" The defector, believed to be a staff sergeant in his mid-20s, is being guarded by South Korean special forces and is known only by his surname, Oh. Oh has had nightmares about returning to Kim Jong Un's regime and told doctors he ""would never ever go back to the military system again"", Mr Lee said. The surgeon added: ""He told me that he is so thankful for South Koreans for saving his life and giving him (12 litres of) blood. ""The patient has to undergo a process over the next week in which he starts eating very thin rice gruel, then a bit thicker rice gruel, and then porridge."" Most North Korean defectors are questioned by Seoul's intelligence agency before being sent to a resettlement centre for a three-month course on life in the South. After their release they are given 7m won (Â£4,850) over 12 months, while police are assigned to ensure their safety. Mr Lee said South Korean military officials were eager to question Oh, but were told to wait until the solider recovers. He said: ""This North Korean guy is not going anywhere. He is staying in South Korea. So we don't need to be hasty."""

His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars.

The man alerted him to an incident in a nearby wooded area where a group of men appeared to be fighting. As the PCSO walked towards the group, he was attacked from behind by an unknown man, who tried to stab him in the face with a knife, police said. The officer was able to fight off the attacker and was taken to hospital with superficial wounds to his hands. All of the men fled. Police appealed for any witnesses or information about the attack, saying it had happened in the woods between Sparrowhawk Close and Cunliffe Close and that the men had fled in the direction of Sparrowhawk Close. The attacker, and the men who had been fighting, were described as white and wearing dark clothing. One of the suspects wore a grey tracksuit. Detective Inspector Clare Coleman said: ""This was a totally unprovoked attack on a police community support officer who was trying to protect our local community. ""The actions of his attacker are simply despicable and I would urge the local community to come together and help us to trace the person responsible so they can be brought to justice.

2017-11-24,"Two of the world's best-known brands are withdrawing their advertising from YouTube and Google over fears they were featured on ""inappropriate"" and ""exploitative"" content featuring children.

The content, although legal and mostly uploaded by children themselves, is easily exploited by paedophile networks who are said to post messages and links to one another in the comments section underneath the videos. The clips are usually of boys and girls performing everyday activities in their homes. But sometimes the children can be seen partially clothed or in their nightwear. Investigators say paedophiles leave lewd comments or even try and encourage the children posting the videos to take part in private forum discussions. YouTube has been accused of failing to safeguard these children despite repeated warnings. Mars told Sky News: ""We are shocked and appalled to see that our adverts have appeared alongside such exploitative and inappropriate content. It is in stark contrast to who we are and what we believe. ""We have taken the decision to immediately suspend all our online advertising on YouTube and Google globally. ""We have stringent guidelines and processes in place and are working with Google and our media buying agencies to understand what went wrong. ""Until we have confidence that appropriate safeguards are in place, we will not advertise on You Tube and Google."" Sportswear manufacturer Adidas told Sky News that it was in urgent talks with YouTube and would suspend all its advertising until the issue had been resolved. It said: ""Adidas takes this issue very seriously and were completely unaware that this situation had arisen on YouTube today. ""We recognise that this situation is clearly unacceptable and have taken immediate action, working closely with Google on all necessary steps to prevent this from happening again. ""We will work with our media agencies and directly with Google to ensure that all future programmatic media buying is closely monitored and everything is done in the future to avoid any reoccurrences of this situation."" YouTube admitted it needed to do more, stating: ""Content that endangers children is abhorrent and unacceptable to us. ""We have clear policies against videos and comments on YouTube which sexualise or exploit children and we enforce them aggressively whenever alerted to such content. ""We have recently toughened our approach to videos and comments featuring children which may not be illegal, but give cause for concern. ""We also work closely with the Internet Watch Foundation, NCMEC and others to prevent child sexual abuse imagery from ever being uploaded and report it to law enforcement. ""We are committed to getting this right and recognise we need to do more, both through machine learning and by increasing human and technical resources."" The decision by Mars to pull its advertising will put Google and YouTube under renewed pressure to ensure children who upload content to its website are better protected. More companies including Amazon and eBay are thought to be reviewing their positions too. That could amount to millions of pounds in lost advertising revenue. A spokesperson for Diageo said: ""We are deeply concerned and are investigating this as a matter of urgency. We always insist that our media providers adhere to the most stringent of precautions to ensure our brands do not appear next to inappropriate content. ""As a consequence, we are enforcing an immediate stop of all YouTube advertising until we are confident the appropriate safeguards are in place. We are committed to the highest standards of marketing and have zero tolerance for any circumstances that fall below our strict marketing codes."" Sky News understands all Adidas adverts appearing on these videos have already been taken down. YouTube says it is in the process of removing all adverts on inappropriate content: It said: ""There shouldn't be any ads running on this content and we are working urgently to fix this. Over the past year, we have been working to ensure that YouTube is a safe place for brands. ""While we have made significant changes in product, policy, enforcement and controls, we will continue to improve."""

The 63-year-old, who was travelling with British resort staff on 16 April 2013, decided not to attempt a sharp turn as he approached the 21st hairpin bend. ""Maurice knew that failing to complete the manoeuvre would send the coach and all its passengers off the road and down the mountain side,"" said coroner Tony Brown. ""He took the brave decision to steer the coach directly into the boulder rocks on the side of the road. ""It would have been obvious to Maurice as driver, that by driving into the boulders in order to keep the coach on the road, he would receive the full force of the collision."" Following the crash, fire took hold of the cabin as passengers tried to escape through broken windows. The inquest heard one woman had become set on fire as the ""complete inferno"" engulfed the coach. Co-driver Nathan Woodland, 39, said Mr Wrightson had not struggled with the steep, winding road, and was not speeding. However, he said they felt the bus twitch after going through a small chicane. He said: ""The gradient was not that steep compared to other bits, but suddenly Maurice looked at me with a very shocked look on his face. ""He said, 'It's not stopping us, it's not stopping us'. I could tell immediately something was very wrong."" Mr Woodland, who also worked for Classic Coaches in County Durham, said he was thrown back several rows following the impact. Four people were seriously injured. The jury at the hearing in Berwick concluded Mr Wrightson died as a result of multiple injuries in a road traffic accident. Investigators in France said the hero driver ""undoubtedly prevented"" the more serious implications of the bus coming off the road. Their report said the brake failure was caused by its pads becoming destroyed due to ""excessive heating"" resulting from the ""poor condition of the hydraulic retarder""."

2017-11-24,"After our first taste of wintry weather, everyone is keen to know if we'll get a White Christmas this year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171125080838/https://news.sky.com/story/will-2017-be-the-year-of-the-white-christmas-11142581,"The bookies certainly think so, slashing their odds over the past few days. But what do the meteorologists reckon? While most of the UK's snow days happen between January and March, statistically the odds are pretty good for a White Christmas. Over the past 57 years, a snowflake has fallen somewhere in the UK on Christmas Day 38 times and that's all you need for an official White Christmas. Yes, believe it or not, the bookies will pay out for just a single flake of snow to be observed falling during the 24 hours of 25 December at a number of official locations across the UK, including Buckingham Palace, Edinburgh Castle, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and Manchester's Coronation Street. Already lying snow on the ground doesn't count, the snowflake has to fall on Christmas Day. Good job too as a Dickensian blanket of snow on the ground is much rarer, only occurring a handful of times over the past half century. So what do we need for snow? The shopping list is pretty short - cold air and moisture in the atmosphere. This moisture is in the form of tiny ice crystals in clouds that collide and stick together to become snowflakes and when they become too heavy they fall to the ground. Our coldest winter weather comes from the Arctic Circle to the north or Siberia to the east. The longer we are exposed to air coming from these directions, the colder it will get. But a plunge of cold air isn't enough, we need to get moisture from somewhere to produce the snow. The usual suspects are polar lows, showers set off over the sea or a frontal system coming up against cold air. Even just continuous heavy rain can lower the air temperature enough for snow to start falling instead. If you're a fan of pressure charts then keep your eyes peeled for cold dry continental air from the north or east bumping into relatively mild moist maritime air from the south or west. This battleground of contrasting air masses can produce snow, but it's a fine line between rain, sleet and snow. Surprisingly, the air temperature doesn't need to be below zero for snow to fall, below 2C is cold enough. In fact, the heaviest snowfalls tend to occur between 0 and 2C. The slightly warmer air causes the snowflakes to melt around the edges and stick together to become big, heavy flakes. This 'wet' snow is great for making snowmen, by the way. Technically 2015 was a White Christmas, with 10% of weather stations recording snow falling, but none reported any snow lying on the ground. And around 13% of weather stations recorded sleet or snow falling in 2009, with 57% reporting snow on the ground. But for the majority of us, the last widespread White Christmas was back in 2010. So will our festive dreams come true this year? In weather terms it is still a long way off but so far the signs are good with a generally blocked pattern. It looks as though temperatures will be below average for much of December, but exactly how cold is still up for grabs. Forecast models are hinting that Atlantic weather fronts will try to push in from the middle of the month, and when rain meets colder air we could well get that all-important festive snowflake."

A 39-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and aggravated burglary. Mr Booth, who was photographed dancing with the Duchess of Cornwall at an event to mark the 70th anniversary of VJ Day, was left with serious injuries to his head and body. A caller knocked on his door and asked if he wanted some work done on his house but when Mr Booth refused, he was attacked with what police believe was a claw hammer. Detective Chief Inspector James Riccio described the incident as ""a vicious and sickening attack on an elderly man in his own home"". He said Mr Booth managed to raise the alarm with a neighbour before he was taken to hospital, where his condition was initially described as ""potentially life-threatening"". ""Offences of this magnitude are rare but I'd like to reassure residents that we're using all necessary resources to investigate this crime,"" DCI Riccio said.

Mr Ellwood shared his ""deep discomfort"" with colleagues about a list of cost-saving options facing the Ministry of Defence, according to a report in The Times. The newspaper said that he had indicated he would step down if the military was not protected from the proposed cuts. Mr Ellwood served in the Royal Green Jackets from 1991 to 1996 with tours in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Kuwait, Germany, Gibraltar and Bosnia. The Bournemouth East MP is now in the Army Reserve and bravely tried to save the life of police officer Keith Palmer, who was stabbed by a terrorist outside the Palace of Westminster in March. The image of Mr Ellwood, face bloodied, fighting to keep PC Palmer alive came to define the day that terror struck at the heart of London. He was appointed to the Privy Council in recognition of the bravery he showed. Asked if Mr Ellwood was known to have concerns about the prospect of cuts to the military, a senior defence source told the Press Association: ""Absolutely."" The Times also said a source had told them that Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson had been shocked by the ""completely awful"" proposals. Other possible cuts were thought to include reducing the order for Ajax armoured vehicles, delaying tank upgrades, axing amphibious assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark and the loss of 1,000 Royal Marines. An MoD spokesman said: ""We have the biggest defence budget in Europe and are one of very few countries to not only meet but exceed NATO's 2% spending target. ""In the face of intensifying threats, we are contributing to the cross-government review of national security capabilities and looking at how we best spend the rising defence budget to protect our country.

Speaking at a meeting of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority on Friday, Mr Burnham interrupted planned proceedings to reveal the news. He said: ""As this meeting has been progressing, I have received a letter from the Prime Minister in relation to the issue I raised around the reimbursement of costs incurred as a result of the attack at the arena. ""While there is going to be a need to look at it carefully - and there is some commitment in it - particularly on the position of police costs, there is no commitment in the letter unfortunately. ""Only a commitment that the costs we've submitted will be looked at and that 'reasonable costs' will be paid, which doesn't sound satisfactory to me."" Mr Burnham claimed Manchester was ""entitled to a better response than this"" having ""waited long enough"" for a reply. ""I don't think we should hold back in saying that we feel this needs to be resolved and resolved quickly,"" he added. ""And, indeed, rather than just 'reasonable costs', all costs incurred as a result should be reimbursed."" Earlier in the meeting, Mr Burnham had criticised the lack of mention in Wednesday's Budget on police, security or counter-terrorism funding. He said the absence of a funding boost by Chancellor Philip Hammond means Greater Manchester Police is set for a real terms cut in the coming year. The PM told me âmajorityâ. It really does need to be ALL. This is what the government said at the time. Iâve tabled a further parliamentary question on this for answer by Monday. https://t.co/5pvG2duCzH The city's authority and local health and police services are seeking reimbursement from Westminster related to the costs incurred by the Manchester Arena atrocity. Mr Burnham went on to tell Sky News that it ""leaves a hole in the finances of our public services"" and questioned: ""How do we fill that hole?"" He added: ""We need to make sure that the residents of Greater Manchester don't lose out."" Also responding to Friday's news, Labour's Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell said she will demand an answer from ministers in Parliament on Monday. Earlier this month, Ms Powell tackled the Prime Minister in the House of Commons over the wait for the costs of the Manchester terror attack to be reimbursed by central Government. At the time, Mrs May said she expected the Government's response ""to confirm that the majority of funds will be made available"". On Friday, a Government spokesperson said: ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring the victims of this terrible attack and Greater Manchester have all possible support. ""We have given strong assurance Manchester will receive Â£12m. That includes Â£3m being paid now and a further Â£1m being made available to support the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. ""This is an ongoing process and the Government stands by its commitment to provide all necessary further assistance."""

Over the course of 40 interviews, he confessed to two more attacks, including the rape of a woman when he was 16, after finally admitting to killing Miss Bowman in 2015. During his trial he denied murdering the teenager and claimed he had sex with her after finding her already dead or dying, but was still found guilty. On Friday, a judge at Southwark Crown Court sentenced Dixie to two life terms with a minimum of 28 years. The prosecution said he may have confessed to maintain ""a degree of notoriety"". His previous sentence meant he would not have been eligible for parole until 2040 - at the age of 69 - but the new sentence will add another four years. At an earlier hearing, Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC said he was ""satisfied"" that Dixie remained a ""serious danger to the public"". He said the father-of-three's offending had ""escalated significantly"" before he was jailed for the teenager's murder. Appearing by videolink from prison, he sat with his hands clasped in front of his face as his horrific crimes were outlined. Dixie's first victim was targeted in her own car in a south London car park in 1987. He tied her up before setting the car on fire but she was able to escape. The court was told he ""seemed delighted in her evident fear"" as she became hysterical during the ordeal. The second attack, in 2002, saw Dixie attack a woman with a chef's steel, used to sharpen kitchen knives, before molesting her. She managed to escape after being interrupted by a man who heard her screams. :: Sally Anne Bowman's killer Mark Dixie admits other sex attacks The court heard of another horrific sex attack in Australia and his barrister said Dixie had admitted to another sexual assault in Spain in 2005. After the sentencing, senior investigator Chris Le Pere branded the prolific offender a ""monster"". He added: ""We know he's offended in Australia, Spain and here, and I believe he's committed other serious offences here and abroad. ""I would appeal to anyone with information about Mark Dixie to come forward."""

Sinatra's daughter Tina said: ""Dad's Christmas recordings are as significant to his vast musical legacy as his signature saloon songs. ""The new Sinatra and Seal duet of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town is a joyous hoot and 'sings' to the spirit of the season."" :: Seal announces comeback with jazz and swing album Seal said: ""To play with Frank's musicians on Standards was quite something, but to perform with the man himself is beyond words."" Seal announced his comeback with his 10th studio album in September, a mix of Sinatra and other rat pack cover, and called it the ""always [he] wanted to record"". This is not the first time Sinatra's voice has been used from beyond the grave. Robbie Williams recorded a version of It Was A Very Good Year, for his album Swing When You're Winning, and Celine Dion recorded All The Way the year after his death. Other singers who have employed studio wizardry for duets include Susan Boyle, who sang with Elvis Presley on O Come All Ye Faithful and Natalie Cole, who sang with her late father Nat King Cole in 1991 and again in 2008."

2017-11-24,The President of the European Council has given the UK 10 days to meet EU demands on the Brexit divorce settlement.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171125080838/https://news.sky.com/story/eu-uk-has-10-days-to-sort-divorce-settlement-11142571,"After an hour-long private meeting with Theresa May in Brussels, Donald Tusk said he would not be able to allow the Brexit negotiations to move to the crucial trade and transition phase unless the UK meets his deadline. In the clearest signal yet that the EU side sees itself as the driver in the Brexit negotiations, Mr Tusk said: ""Sufficient progress in Brexit talks at December European Council (summit) is possible. ""But still a huge challenge. ""We need to see progress from UK within 10 days on all issues, including on Ireland."" An EU source, who was at the meeting, added: ""Prime Minister May agreed to this timeframe. ""If no progress within next 10 days, it will not be possible for Mr Tusk to propose draft guidelines for the second phase of the talks on the transition and the future relationship."" Mrs May's assessment of the same meeting was more upbeat, insisting the ""atmosphere was positive"". ""There are still issues across the various matters that we are negotiating on to be resolved but there's been a very positive atmosphere in the talks and a genuine feeling that we want to move forward together,"" she said. Mrs May held a flurry of other bilateral meetings on the sidelines of a summit called to discuss ways of supporting counties on the EU's eastern flank, threatened by Russian aggression. The meetings, with the Lithuanian, Belgian, Danish and German leaders are being presented by the UK as useful, constructive engagements. A Belgian government source told Sky News that Mrs May and Belgian PM Charles Michel had very comprehensive discussions about how to progress on all the Brexit divorce issues. Belgium is among a group of EU states with a huge trade relationship with the UK and therefore keen on a good trade deal. The meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel was hastily organised and an important moment of engagement. ""Very constructive,"" a Downing Street source said. Mrs Merkel is a key EU player which the UK wants on side. But she is distracted from Brexit by her own fragile domestic politics as she tries to form a collation government. Assessing his meeting with Mrs May, the Danish Prime Minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, told Sky News: ""It was very constructive. It wasn't a negotiating meeting. She informed me; briefed me about how she looks at things. And from my perspective it seems that there is progress. So I've decided to be optimistic about this and I really hope that we can move forward in December."" It's not clear if Mrs May privately committed to parting with more money as part of the so-called Brexit bill. At a meeting with Cabinet colleagues at the start of the week it's thought she sought agreement to increase the amount the Government is prepared to pay. In her Florence speech in September she pledged to honour the UK's financial commitments - thought to amount to about Â£20bn. However the EU has said that if the UK is to ""settle its accounts"" as it leaves the EU, it should pay a much higher figure, thought to be about Â£40-50bn. The question of money is one of three divorce issues which the EU wants agreed before negotiations can move to transition and trade talks. On the second issue - citizens rights - there remain disagreements over the role of the European Court of Justice. But it is the third divorce issue - the Irish border question - which is now proving to be the most intractable. The Irish government says talks cannot move to phase two until the UK gives Dublin a written and tangible assurance that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic or Ireland after Brexit. The British government has been unable to do this because, by insisting that the the UK is leaving the single market and customs union, a physical border of some form appears inevitable. Asked by Sky News if his country would be willing and able to veto talks moving to the trade phase, and if he has the support of the rest of the EU, the Irish Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney was firm. ""Yes, absolutely... and we have seen no suggestion of other countries moving away from that position of solidarity. We want to work with Britain. ""We want to be fair but firm in protecting what are really important Irish issues for the future and I think the British government understand that now."" An EU source added that particular attention was now being paid to the Irish issue. ""The UK will need to give credible assurances as to how to avoid a hard border before 4 December, as it is still unclear how this can be done,"" the EU source said. Mrs May is due back in Brussels on the 4 December deadline for a key Brexit dinner with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker."

Armed police swooped on the station and along Oxford Street after receiving reports that shots had been fired. :: 'Screaming and pandemonium' amid Oxford Circus alert A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said: ""Armed officers from BTP and MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) were quickly on scene. The area was searched swiftly and the station was re-opened. ""Officers believe an altercation erupted between two men on the platform."" They issued CCTV images of two men they want to speak to and have appealed to anyone with information to come forward. Chief Superintendent Martin Fry said: ""Thank you to everyone for bearing with us this evening and also to colleagues from all the emergency services who helped carry out a swift response. ""I know incidents like these can cause concern, but our officers are highly visible around the network and across the country."" Stuart Crichton, London Ambulance Service assistant director of operations, said paramedics treated several patients who sustained injuries while leaving Oxford Circus. He said: ""We discharged seven patients at the scene and took eight patients to two central London hospitals for minor injuries. ""We also took one patient to a major trauma centre for leg injuries."" Shortly after 4.30pm on Friday police were called to reports of gunshots. Crowds of people poured out of Selfridges department store, all Underground trains in the area were halted, traffic was blocked and officers locked people inside shops. It was an hour-and-a-half before police gave the all-clear. Eyewitnesses reported being caught in ""stampedes"" and said there was ""pandemonium"" as police treated the incident as if it was terrorist-related. However, police said they could find no evidence of shots fired. They added: ""Given the nature of the information received, the Met responded in line with our existing operation as if the incident was terrorism, including the deployment of armed officers. ""Officers working with colleagues from British Transport Police carried out an urgent search of the area."" British Transport Police said there was ""a significant level of panic"", adding that it was ""examining the circumstances of the incident which resulted in the station being evacuated"".

Selfridges later said the evacuation of its shop was a precautionary measure and there were ""no reported incidents in store"". Bryce Malcolmson, who works in Soho, said he was in Oxford Circus Tube station when he heard a call over the loudspeaker for a police officer to attend one of the platforms. He told Sky News: ""Suddenly I just heard screaming and people running out of the station. Everybody turned round in sort of pandemonium and started trying to exit the Tube as quickly as possible. ""I got up to the top by the ticket barriers and they were all open. I ran out on to the street but it was almost as if no one knew anything had happened down below. ""Withinâ¦ a couple of minutes there were armed response units and police cars absolutely everywhere. I think people were so unsure what had happened they were running in all directions."" Tourist Lanna Woodward said she witnessed the aftermath of the panic on Oxford Street. The 20-year-old from California said: ""Before it all I saw about 30 police officers speeding down the street. ""We were in the Kingdom of Sweets and then saw a massive crowd of people running and screaming. People were climbing on top of each other. ""The store we were in was locked down, the manager wouldn't let us leave - they said there had been a shooting at the entrance of the Tube station."" Paying tribute to the ""swift response"" of emergency services, mayor Sadiq Khan urged Londoners to ""remain vigilant and don't panic"". He said: ""It is vital that we are not complacent - if in doubt it is always best to err on the side of caution and call the police on 999."" :: Anyone with any information can call BTP on 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016 citing reference 405 of 24/11."

Baker, 83, has now returned to film part of the 1979 story, which was abandoned because of the strike. The new scene shows Baker at the Tardis controls in his signature coat and scarf, and combines original live-action footage with new animation. Baker was the fourth Doctor and his appearance is his first in the role in 36 years. In the new scene, he voices words from Douglas Adams' original script and wonders aloud: ""I expect that sometime in the future - in about 200 years' time - someone will meet me and say is that really the Doctor? He seemed such a nice old man."" Speaking about the cameo, the actor said: ""Shada was one of my favourite Doctor Who stories. I have many fond memories of shooting the location scenes in Cambridge, and it was disappointing not to finish the story in the studio."" ""When I was doing Doctor Who it was the realisation of all my childhood fantasies,"" he said, ""so I took to it like a duck to water and I still do. ""I loved doing Doctor Who because it was life to me... My real life was really rather drab... I used to dread the end of rehearsal...""

She said: ""That's not true. I don't think (her position) is solely based on her relationship with us as a result of the confidence and supply agreement. ""I fundamentally believe, and she has said many times, that she is a unionist so why wouldn't she want to preserve the constitutional position of Northern Ireland?"" Speaking in her rural Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, which overlooks part of the Irish border, Mrs Foster criticised the Irish government for demanding commitments from the UK before consenting to the next phase of Brexit negotiations. ""It's been quite aggressive in relation to Brexit and instead of looking for solutionsâ¦there's been a lot of megaphone diplomacy,"" Mrs Foster said. :: Fresh Brexit tensions over Ireland border The EU has demanded ""sufficient progress"" on key divorce issues - including the Irish border - before allowing Brexit talks to move on to discussions about future trade. Mrs Foster also accused the Irish government of ""cherry-picking"" the Good Friday Agreement in its own interest. She said: ""The fundamental of the agreement is that we had the principle of consent, which essentially means that it is for the people of Northern Ireland to decide whether they want to stay within the United Kingdom or otherwise. ""We are part of the United Kingdom, a full part of the United Kingdom, and that shouldn't be forgotten by the Irish government. ""It certainly shouldn't be forgotten by the people in Brussels."" :: Irish PM Leo Varadkar throws a spanner in Brexit works The Irish government wants Northern Ireland to remain in the EU's customs union to prevent changes at the Irish border, but the DUP insists it will leave with the rest of the UK. Asked if she feared the Irish government holding out until they receive more clarity on the border, Mrs Foster added: ""I think it would be very wrong if they exercised their veto. ""What we want to get down to is the detailed work in relation to the border and to our trading relationships and how it's going to work post-Brexit."" Mrs Foster will address her party's annual conference this weekend, five months after the DUP came to the aid of the Tories after they lost their Westminster majority at June's snap General Election."

Ireland has recently demanded a formal written guarantee that there will be no hard border with Northern Ireland before it will sanction Brexit negotiations moving on to their next phase, on future EU-UK trade arrangements. But, calling for ""flexible and imaginative"" solutions from Brussels and Dublin, Mr Dodds claimed Ireland has dismissed the UK's own proposals to avoid such a scenario. ""Their real aim is to try to get to a situation where either they try to force the UK as a whole to stay within the customs union, which is in their interests, clearly,"" Mr Dodds told Sky News. ""Or, if they fail that, to at least force Northern Ireland to stay within the customs union and the single market, follow the rules of it, something then we'd have no say over, but we'd have to abide by the rules, which would then bring about a united Ireland much easier."" Mr Dodds highlighted a UK Government position paper on the Irish border, published earlier this year, which suggested there will no need for post-Brexit customs checks on the island of Ireland due to exemptions and trusted trader schemes. The DUP politician added it would be ""economic madness"" and ""politically unacceptable"" for Northern Ireland to be separated from the rest of the UK by remaining in the customs union or single market. Theresa May has insisted the whole of the UK will be leaving both the customs union and single market after Brexit. Downing Street was forced to clarify this position remains the same on Friday, after a spokesman had earlier told a Westminster briefing Northern Ireland's continuing membership of the customs union was ""a matter for negotiation"". Meanwhile, there were further signals the Irish border issue has become a major sticking point before a crunch EU summit next month, when the Prime Minister hopes European leaders will sanction the start of phase two Brexit talks. Speaking at a separate Brussels summit with eastern European nations on Friday, Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said it was difficult to see how border checks could be avoided if Brexit resulted in ""regulatory divergence"" between the UK and EU. ""We can't move to phase two on the basis of aspiration,"" he said. ""We have move to phase two on the basis of a credible road map or the parameters around which we can design a credible road map to ensure that it doesn't happen.""

Strong solidarity with #Ireland: Irish issues are EU issues. pic.twitter.com/uqGFSh3Skc Mr Coveney suggested there would be a ""difficulty coming up"" in Brexit talks if there was no progress on post-Brexit regulatory arrangements. His warning followed reports Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a leading Brexit supporter, has won a Cabinet battle and convinced Mrs May to move away from EU rules once Britain leaves the bloc. Following a meeting with Mr Coveney on the sidelines of the EU summit, the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier pledged ""strong solidarity"" with Dublin, adding: ""Irish issues are EU issues"".

Severe weather warnings for ice have been issued for Northern Ireland, Wales, parts of Scotland, northern England and the West Midlands from 5pm on Friday until 10am on Saturday. The Met Office said icy patches are likely to form on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths and there is ""potential for slippery surfaces and difficult driving conditions"". Sky News weather presenter Kirsty McCabe said: ""Cold air from the Arctic will bring a risk of ice and snow to parts of the UK and Ireland this weekend. ""While we will all need to wrap up warm, don't get ready to build your snowman just yet. ""During Friday a mix of rain, sleet and snow showers will affect northern and western Scotland, Northern Ireland, western Ireland, northwest England and Wales. ""The rest of the weekend is set to be cold but bright with further wintry showers in areas exposed to the brisk northwesterly wind. ""Overnight frost and ice will continue to affect many, with snow mainly confined to higher ground."" Public Health England has urged people to be prepared ahead of the cold weather, with very young children, older people and those with conditions such as heart and lung disease most at risk. Bookies have slashed the odds on the UK seeing a white Christmas this year, with one bookmaker offering odds of 4-5 on snow falling anywhere in the country on 25 December. Kirsty McCabe said most of the UK's snow days happen between January and March, with sleet or snow falling on average 7.6 days in January, 6.8 days in February and 6 days in March. December averages only 5.3 snow days, meaning there is a greater chance of a white Easter than white Christmas when Easter falls early in the calendar, she said."

Owen owns and breeds racehorses, but has only got in the saddle himself this year. Before the race, he said: ""Experiencing first-hand quite how difficult it is has definitely increased my respect for jockeys. ""I am in a fortunate position that I have two horses at the stables that I could ride in the race. ""One is on the safer side, but I plan to ride the more challenging horse as I think it gives me the best chance of winning, and this was never just about taking part. ""Having said that, on this occasion I realise just crossing the line will be an achievement."" Owen, who played for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle, Manchester United and Stoke, admitted he'd fallen off the horses several times but said that didn't stop him catching ""the bug"". For Friday's event in Berkshire, he rode Calder Prince, who he described as ""a diamond"". The 2001 European Footballer of the Year added he hoped it was not his last race as he claimed he ""caught the bug"". The Prince's fund provides Â£1.2m in grants every year to projects around the country, from apprenticeships, to community transport schemes to training for young people. Owen is not the first sportsman to turn trade. Cyclist Bradley Wiggins announced he is to make his competitive rowing debut at the indoor championships in December. Fellow cyclist Victoria Pendleton's eye was also caught by horse racing and she became a jockey last year."

Mr Isaacs and his friends fled but he became separated and was stabbed multiple times with a large knife. The apprentice carpenter was taken to hospital where he died on Tuesday. The Metropolitan Police has announced a Â£20,000 reward for information that leads to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the killing. The teenager's family said in a statement: ""We are devastated to have lost our beautiful son in such senseless circumstances. ""Jason was a kind and loving son and brother who adored his music, fashion and his beloved QPR football team. He was working hard as an apprentice carpenter, loved socialising and was a very popular boy. ""We feel that knife crime in this area, and in London, is out of control and it must be stopped before another young life is taken, and another family has to suffer what we are suffering now. ""We need to educate young people early on around the dangers of carrying knives in public places.

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: ""This appears to have been an unprovoked, pre-planned attack. Jason, who was unarmed and not looking for trouble, was stabbed multiple times with a large knife. ""Jason was a popular lad who has had his life brutally ended for no reason, leaving his family and friends devastated."" In London, 18 teenagers have been stabbed to death so far this year.

2017-11-24,"A bomb and gun attack in the north Sinai has brought new devastation to Egypt, with at least 235 killed in one of the country's most brutal assaults in memory.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171125080838/https://news.sky.com/story/egypt-attack-why-were-sufis-targeted-11142575,"Gunmen wreaked havoc in a mosque in the town of Bir al Abed, targeting the Sufi Muslim community that worshipped there. The mosque was largely attended by Sufi Muslims, seen as non-believers by Islamic State. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but Egypt's state news agency MENA said it ""appeared"" to have been carried out by IS. Some analysts think Sufism - a movement known for its mystical and introspective approach to Islam - is targeted by Islamic State because it is seen as a non-military threat to the group. With a strongly non-violent approach and clear identity, analyst Mohannad Sabry told Sky News, Sufi Islam has proved attractive to young people IS hopes to recruit. ""The Sufis are succeeding in drawing hundreds of youths from the terrorist organisation in a way the military hasn't been able to do,"" Mr Sabry, a journalist and analyst who has worked extensively in the Sinai, said. ""And I believe that the most important point, for ISIS, is to eliminate their ideological rival rather than a military rival."" IS did not take immediate responsibility for the Friday attack, but reports said it showed the hallmarks of the group. Its Egypt branch has killed hundreds of people in the north Sinai, targeting the army as well followers of Sufism and Christianity. It views Sufi practices - such as different kinds of chanting or prayers, and maintaining the shrines of holy figures, and a focus on achieving purity to witness the presence of God - as against Islam. There are some 15 million Sufis worldwide, including the head of Al Azhar, Egypt's top Islamic authority, and many Sufi families have been firmly established in the political histories of Arab states. Writing in the Huffington Post, analyst Sami Moubayed described the Sufi understanding of a caliphate as a state of ""good or loving spirits"", brought about through love. ""Only Sufis have the religious tools, intellectual skills, and political cunning to dismantle ISIS,"" he argues. ""That is precisely why they are excommunicated by ISIS."" In the troubled north Sinai, where the Sufi community has been firmly established for centuries, there has been a long-running struggle with newer hardline Salafi groups like IS. Jihadists last year beheaded an elderly Sufi leader on charges of witchcraft, and the group published a newsletter saying combating Sufism was a priority. ""There has long been a pull and push dynamic in the Sinai between Salafi Muslims and Sufi Muslims,"" Mr Sabry said. In the Sinai Sufi leaders have worked with Egyptian authorities in a fight against insurgents which has also exposed it to threats. ""The Sufi community seems to have a mission to remain peaceful, no matter how difficult things are,"" Mr Sabry said. ""They also happen to be one of the most loyal communities to the Egyptian state."" Followers of the belief system have suffered attacks elsewhere, too. Leaders and shrines are targeted in low-level violence in Iraq and Syria, as well as more spectacular attacks: last November 52 people were killed and this February 83 died in an IS attack on a Sufi shrine, both in Pakistan. The Sufi community in the Sinai, Mr Sabry said, is one known for its persistence, and after enduring many attacks on clerics and holy places it will take a lot to shatter the strength it's built up over many years. But he said there is a fear that such a spectacular and horrific attack could indicate more brutality to come. ""If it's the beginning of a pattern it could be the beginning of a war against Sufis that could be much more more terrifying,"" he said."
2017-11-24,These are difficult times for the pub industry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171125080838/https://news.sky.com/story/beer-boss-balks-at-unprecedented-cost-pressures-in-pub-sector-11141528,"The rate of closures has slowed down, from 29 per week several years ago to 21 per week now, but trading remains tough. Pub prices remain high compared with cheap supermarket beer, while the competitive threat from supermarkets is exacerbated by the fact that food sold in pubs is subject to VAT, while food sold in supermarkets is not. Many regular drinkers, who were driven away from pubs by the smoking ban in 2007, still prefer to drink - and smoke - at home. Business rates, meanwhile, remain such a perennial bugbear that the Treasury has had to provide pubs with specific reliefs - renewed this week by the Chancellor in his Budget - to help dull the pain. Societal changes have also contributed, including a switch from beer to wine among many drinkers and a drop in popularity among younger consumers, with one in six people aged between 18-25 are reckoned to be teetotal. And now, with earnings growth again starting to lag inflation, disposable incomes are again under pressure. There is an additional factor in London. The Economist magazine recently published analysis showing that pub closures in the capital had been particularly marked, which it said was partly because London was over-saturated with pubs to begin with and also because of the growing concentration in some boroughs of Muslims, whose religion forbids them from drinking alcohol. Under those circumstances, today's half year results from Fuller, Smith & Turner, the Chiswick-based pub operator and brewer of beers such as London Pride, are pretty creditable. Half year sales rose by 6%, to Â£209.3m, while pre-tax profits on an underlying basis rose by 4% to Â£23.8m. Within that, sales and profits in Fuller's managed pub and hotel business, which now account for almost two-thirds of group profits, were up by 7% and 6% respectively. Sales in the brewing operation, whose other brands include Honeydew, Seafarers, ESB and Frontier Craft Lager, were up 5%, but operating profits fell by 13%, which the company blamed on increasing marketing spending and a pincer attack from rivals. At one end of the market, the global mega-brewers have been cutting prices aggressively, while at the other, independent craft brewers have been benefiting from lower levels of beer duty than their larger rivals. So Fullers has been caught in the middle. Yet the pressure is still there. Simon Emeny, the chief executive, pointed out today: ""The last six months have seen some unprecedented influences on the business, not only in our particular industry, but in the context of the wider UK economy and global political scene. ""I cannot remember a time when we have faced such an array of additional cost pressures, particularly in our managed pubs, starting with the 26% rise in business rates. The pub sector is now responsible for 2.8% of the total business rates bill, despite only generating just 0.5% of total turnover. ""Over and above this increase, we have met with rises in the Apprenticeship Levy and Living Wage rates."" Fuller's is not the only pub operator warning of tough conditions. On Thursday, Mitchells & Butlers - owner of the Miller & Carter, Toby Carvery, All Bar One, O'Neill's and Harvester chains - announced it would not be paying a half-year dividend next year, flagging higher costs as a result of the drop in the pound, while also warning that it could face staffing shortages depending on changes to immigration and employment laws as Britain leaves the EU. There was this warning, too, from the pub operator Youngs last week: ""The political environment remains predictable and this ongoing uncertainty is unhelpful when it comes to the strength of the broader economy."" It, too, flagged concerns over Brexit. But are pub customers really being deterred from popping to their local due to fears that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, may be putting one over on David Davis? Tim Martin, founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon and a vocal supporter of the Leave campaign, made this observation earlier this month: ""Statements have been made by some senior PLC directors and trade organisations which are factually incorrect and highly misleading. ""Unsurprisingly, the misinformation has been adopted by many among the media, investors and the public as if it were true."" Yet even Mr Martin, who says Wetherspoon is ready for Brexit, admits costs have been ""significantly higher"" than last year, with further increases expected in labour, business rates, utilities and sugar taxes. Others warning recently on tough trading conditions include Marston's, the pub operator and brewer of beers including Pedigree, Hobgoblin and Thwaite's Lancaster Bomber, which warned last month of ""subdued market conditions"". And Greene King, Britain's biggest remaining combined brewer and pub operator, warned in September that it expected ""the challenges of weaker consumer confidence, increased costs and increasing competition to persist over the near term"". The message is clear: Britain's pubs are having a tough time of it. And the relief offered by the Chancellor this week, offering a Â£1,000 discount on business rates for pubs with a rateable value of under Â£100,000, may not be enough to stop that pub closure rate accelerating again."

Katie died after she was smothered by the teen and then slashed with a Stanley knife in a park in York on 9 January. The teenager - who was 15 at the time of the attack - admitted manslaughter due to diminished responsibility at a previous hearing, and appeared by video link at Leeds Crown Court for sentencing as Katie's family looked on. She clutched a soft toy throughout the hearing, and sat with her head down. Mr Justice Soole told her: ""The gravity of the offence of killing a small child speaks for itself. The level of danger to the public is high. ""In the circumstances of your continuing silence, the critical question is whether there is any reliable estimate as to how long that danger will continue."" Katie's family said in a statement: ""Today is the end of a process and that is a relief, but it's not the end of our story. ""Our story is about a loving home and family that was torn apart on the day we lost our daughter. ""Our story goes on into the future, where our home feels very empty, but we will keep going for the sake of our other children and our grandson. ""Our hopes for the future are for a loving and safe home for our family, and we hope we will now find the privacy for that to happen."" Katie was found on a playing field with two severe cuts to her neck and chest, but the prosecutor said a post-mortem showed neither caused her death and that the little girl was smothered before the cuts were made. Police recovered items from the scene and from the teenager's home, including drawings of stick men depicting killing and death. Books, violent comics and a Simba toy that had its ears cut off and stuffed into its stomach were found in the teenager's bedroom. Prosecutors said at earlier hearings that the teenager was given medication for anxiety and depression, and had suffered from delusions during 2016. They said the girl had talked of being convinced that people ""weren't human and were robots"". The judge was told she may have been trying to prove Katie was not a robot as she had ""irrational beliefs"". ""This investigation has been one of the most tragic and challenging I have ever dealt with in my career as a police officer,"" said DCI Andrea Kell, from North Yorkshire Police. ""There are no positive results from cases such as these. Regardless of the conviction and the sentence, nothing will ever replace the loss of Katie."""
2017-11-25,Parliament's close procedural combat over Brexit has begun in earnest. All-night sittings and all-out battles between and within parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/twin-tightropes-for-theresa-may-amid-mps-close-brexit-combat-11126950,"It began surreally enough, with Labour's backbench Brexiteer Frank Field arguing about the precise hour of Brexit. His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."

The 63-year-old, who was travelling with British resort staff on 16 April 2013, decided not to attempt a sharp turn as he approached the 21st hairpin bend. ""Maurice knew that failing to complete the manoeuvre would send the coach and all its passengers off the road and down the mountain side,"" said coroner Tony Brown. ""He took the brave decision to steer the coach directly into the boulder rocks on the side of the road. ""It would have been obvious to Maurice as driver, that by driving into the boulders in order to keep the coach on the road, he would receive the full force of the collision."" Following the crash, fire took hold of the cabin as passengers tried to escape through broken windows. The inquest heard one woman had become set on fire as the ""complete inferno"" engulfed the coach. Co-driver Nathan Woodland, 39, said Mr Wrightson had not struggled with the steep, winding road, and was not speeding. However, he said they felt the bus twitch after going through a small chicane. He said: ""The gradient was not that steep compared to other bits, but suddenly Maurice looked at me with a very shocked look on his face. ""He said, 'It's not stopping us, it's not stopping us'. I could tell immediately something was very wrong."" Mr Woodland, who also worked for Classic Coaches in County Durham, said he was thrown back several rows following the impact. Four people were seriously injured. The jury at the hearing in Berwick concluded Mr Wrightson died as a result of multiple injuries in a road traffic accident. Investigators in France said the hero driver ""undoubtedly prevented"" the more serious implications of the bus coming off the road. Their report said the brake failure was caused by its pads becoming destroyed due to ""excessive heating"" resulting from the ""poor condition of the hydraulic retarder""."

He died four days later, apparently still unclear about the claims against him. :: Carl Sargeant hanged himself, says post-mortem There have been a series of sexual scandals in Westminster, forcing the Commons to begin drawing up a new complaints procedure.

But that may be about to change, with the Government announcing the introduction of a draft drone bill, to be published next spring. The proposed bill will mean drone pilots will have register and sit safety awareness tests as part of plans to regulate their use. The new measures will also give police the right to ground drones or to seize drone parts to prove the device has been used to commit a crime. National Police Chiefs' Council lead for criminal misuse of drones, Assistant Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said: ""Police forces are aware of the ever increasing use of drones by members of the public and we are working with all relevant partners to understand the threats that this new technology can pose when used irresponsibly or illegally. ""Do not take this lightly - if you use a drone to invade people's privacy or engage in disruptive behaviour, you could face serious criminal charges."" Banning drones from flying near airports or above 400ft could also form part of the new regulations. Currently, drones weighing more than 7kg can't be flown above 400ft, and they must always be in the pilot's line of sight. Most of the drone incidents reported by pilots are made at flight level - that's around 5,000 ft. But some have even been reported at up to 35,000ft. The danger can be seen in the increasing numbers of reports from pilots who say they have had a near-miss with a drone. In 2014 there were only six incidents but in 2015 that rose to 29. Last year there were 71 reports and in the first eight months of this year, there have already been 81. However, the Government does not want to ban drones completely. On Monday a scheme will be launched to support the research and development of drone technology for uses in industry, logistics and healthcare. Aviation minister Baroness Sugg said: ""Drones have great potential and we want to do everything possible to harness the benefits of this technology as it develops. ""But if we are to realise the full potential of this incredibly exciting technology, we have to take steps to stop illegal use of these devices and address safety and privacy concerns. ""These new laws strike a balance, to allow the vast majority of drone users to continue flying safely and responsibly, while also paving the way for drone technology to revolutionise businesses and public services."" The draft drone bill will be published for consultation and introduce secondary legislation amendments in spring 2018."

Half year sales rose by 6%, to Â£209.3m, while pre-tax profits on an underlying basis rose by 4% to Â£23.8m. Within that, sales and profits in Fuller's managed pub and hotel business, which now account for almost two-thirds of group profits, were up by 7% and 6% respectively. Sales in the brewing operation, whose other brands include Honeydew, Seafarers, ESB and Frontier Craft Lager, were up 5%, but operating profits fell by 13%, which the company blamed on increasing marketing spending and a pincer attack from rivals. At one end of the market, the global mega-brewers have been cutting prices aggressively, while at the other, independent craft brewers have been benefiting from lower levels of beer duty than their larger rivals. So Fullers has been caught in the middle. Yet the pressure is still there. Simon Emeny, the chief executive, pointed out today: ""The last six months have seen some unprecedented influences on the business, not only in our particular industry, but in the context of the wider UK economy and global political scene. ""I cannot remember a time when we have faced such an array of additional cost pressures, particularly in our managed pubs, starting with the 26% rise in business rates. The pub sector is now responsible for 2.8% of the total business rates bill, despite only generating just 0.5% of total turnover. ""Over and above this increase, we have met with rises in the Apprenticeship Levy and Living Wage rates."" Fuller's is not the only pub operator warning of tough conditions. On Thursday, Mitchells & Butlers - owner of the Miller & Carter, Toby Carvery, All Bar One, O'Neill's and Harvester chains - announced it would not be paying a half-year dividend next year, flagging higher costs as a result of the drop in the pound, while also warning that it could face staffing shortages depending on changes to immigration and employment laws as Britain leaves the EU. There was this warning, too, from the pub operator Youngs last week: ""The political environment remains predictable and this ongoing uncertainty is unhelpful when it comes to the strength of the broader economy."" It, too, flagged concerns over Brexit. But are pub customers really being deterred from popping to their local due to fears that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, may be putting one over on David Davis? Tim Martin, founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon and a vocal supporter of the Leave campaign, made this observation earlier this month: ""Statements have been made by some senior PLC directors and trade organisations which are factually incorrect and highly misleading. ""Unsurprisingly, the misinformation has been adopted by many among the media, investors and the public as if it were true."" Yet even Mr Martin, who says Wetherspoon is ready for Brexit, admits costs have been ""significantly higher"" than last year, with further increases expected in labour, business rates, utilities and sugar taxes. Others warning recently on tough trading conditions include Marston's, the pub operator and brewer of beers including Pedigree, Hobgoblin and Thwaite's Lancaster Bomber, which warned last month of ""subdued market conditions"". And Greene King, Britain's biggest remaining combined brewer and pub operator, warned in September that it expected ""the challenges of weaker consumer confidence, increased costs and increasing competition to persist over the near term"". The message is clear: Britain's pubs are having a tough time of it. And the relief offered by the Chancellor this week, offering a Â£1,000 discount on business rates for pubs with a rateable value of under Â£100,000, may not be enough to stop that pub closure rate accelerating again."
2017-11-25,Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a potential backbench rebellion over potential defence cost-saving plans.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-facing-tory-rebellion-over-possible-defence-cuts-11142938,"Tory MP Johnny Mercer, a former Army officer who now sits on the Defence Select Committee, told Sky News he has ""a resilient cohort of Conservative MPs"" who are unhappy with the idea of further cuts. He was speaking after The Times reported that Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood had told colleagues of his ""deep discomfort"" about the levels of cuts facing the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The newspaper claimed the planned cuts would see the Army lose 12,000 soldiers, leaving its full-time strength at just 70,000. Other possible cuts were thought to include reducing the order for Ajax armoured vehicles, delaying tank upgrades, axing amphibious assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, and the loss of 1,000 Royal Marines. With the Government's small majority only seven, Tory MPs would need to rebel in any potential vote to defeat any legislation. Mr Mercer said: ""It is the first duty of government. We know we're in difficult times but we can't just talk about it we have to fund it properly, we have to resource it properly. ""What do we want from the military? You can't just talk about that. You have to fund it properly, you can't ask them for stuff and then not give them the money to do it. ""There was clearly some fat in the system, but we've hit a resilient boulder and it's our job as politicians to stand up for that and to stand up for what we believe in."" The newly-appointed Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is also reportedly unhappy with the level of cuts his department may face. Defence minister Mr Ellwood served in the Royal Green Jackets from 1991 to 1996, with tours in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Kuwait, Germany, Gibraltar and Bosnia. He is reportedly prepared to resign if the cuts are given the green light. The Bournemouth East MP is now in the Army Reserve and bravely tried to save the life of police officer Keith Palmer, who was stabbed by a terrorist outside the Palace of Westminster in March. Fellow Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, tweeted his support for Mr Ellwood saying he was ""proud"" of his stance. An MoD spokesman said: ""We have the biggest defence budget in Europe and are one of very few countries to not only meet but exceed NATO's 2% spending target. ""In the face of intensifying threats, we are contributing to the cross-government review of national security capabilities and looking at how we best spend the rising defence budget to protect our country. ""No decisions have been made and any discussion of the options is pure speculation."""
2017-11-25,"One in four women in the UK are affected by sexual or physical violence, according to the latest United Nations statistics.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/violence-against-women-time-to-take-action-11144556,"The figures were released ahead of the International Day to End Violence Against Women and Girls on 25 November. The prevalence of gender-based violence, across all countries and in all cultures, has sparked a new campaign by the UN Women called Draw A Line. During the next 16 days, UN Women and partners will light up iconic buildings in orange, to symbolise a brighter future without violence. In central London, campaigners encircled Covent Garden market with a bright orange vinyl tape; a physical line that stopped passers-by in their tracks. Messages were printed on it revealing the scale of violence, such as the fact that, on average, every week two women in the UK are killed by their partners. Laura Haynes, UN Women's UK Chair told Sky News, said: ""There has been a lot of talk about ending violence against women. ""What we've said is it's important to make a statement, it's important to be heard, but people are desperate now to take action, to find a way to make a difference. ""And so we said enough is enough, it's time to literally draw a line to end violence against women."" Too few women report being the victims of violence or abuse. A UN report revealed that a women is assaulted an average of 35 times before she reports it, and 85% of rapes are never reported at all. Phoebe Tansley, a women's rights campaigner, told Sky News: ""If you look at the rates of reporting and the rates of convictions for sexual and domestic violence in the UK, they are still shockingly low. ""There are issues there where our systems are not representing survivors properly and they are not giving them the access to justice and the support that they need."" There were marches and protests in a number of locations besides London, including France, Lebanon and Spain. The campaign ends on 10 December."

2017-11-25,"After our first taste of wintry weather, everyone is keen to know if we'll get a White Christmas this year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/will-2017-be-the-year-of-the-white-christmas-11142581,"The bookies certainly think so, slashing their odds over the past few days. But what do the meteorologists reckon? While most of the UK's snow days happen between January and March, statistically the odds are pretty good for a White Christmas. Over the past 57 years, a snowflake has fallen somewhere in the UK on Christmas Day 38 times and that's all you need for an official White Christmas. Yes, believe it or not, the bookies will pay out for just a single flake of snow to be observed falling during the 24 hours of 25 December at a number of official locations across the UK, including Buckingham Palace, Edinburgh Castle, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and Manchester's Coronation Street. Already lying snow on the ground doesn't count, the snowflake has to fall on Christmas Day. Good job too as a Dickensian blanket of snow on the ground is much rarer, only occurring a handful of times over the past half century. So what do we need for snow? The shopping list is pretty short - cold air and moisture in the atmosphere. This moisture is in the form of tiny ice crystals in clouds that collide and stick together to become snowflakes and when they become too heavy they fall to the ground. Our coldest winter weather comes from the Arctic Circle to the north or Siberia to the east. The longer we are exposed to air coming from these directions, the colder it will get. But a plunge of cold air isn't enough, we need to get moisture from somewhere to produce the snow. The usual suspects are polar lows, showers set off over the sea or a frontal system coming up against cold air. Even just continuous heavy rain can lower the air temperature enough for snow to start falling instead. If you're a fan of pressure charts then keep your eyes peeled for cold dry continental air from the north or east bumping into relatively mild moist maritime air from the south or west. This battleground of contrasting air masses can produce snow, but it's a fine line between rain, sleet and snow. Surprisingly, the air temperature doesn't need to be below zero for snow to fall, below 2C is cold enough. In fact, the heaviest snowfalls tend to occur between 0 and 2C. The slightly warmer air causes the snowflakes to melt around the edges and stick together to become big, heavy flakes. This 'wet' snow is great for making snowmen, by the way. Technically 2015 was a White Christmas, with 10% of weather stations recording snow falling, but none reported any snow lying on the ground. And around 13% of weather stations recorded sleet or snow falling in 2009, with 57% reporting snow on the ground. But for the majority of us, the last widespread White Christmas was back in 2010. So will our festive dreams come true this year? In weather terms it is still a long way off but so far the signs are good with a generally blocked pattern. It looks as though temperatures will be below average for much of December, but exactly how cold is still up for grabs. Forecast models are hinting that Atlantic weather fronts will try to push in from the middle of the month, and when rain meets colder air we could well get that all-important festive snowflake."
2017-11-25,The deputy head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has warned Europe that it could increase the range of its missiles.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/iran-warns-europe-we-can-increase-missile-range-11144615,"In comments reported by the Fars news agency, Brigadier General Hossein Salami said: ""If we have kept the range of our missiles to 2,000 kilometres, its not due to lack of technology. ""We are following a strategic doctrine. ""So far we have felt that Europe is not a threat, so we did not increase the range of our missiles. ""But if Europe wants to turn into a threat, we will increase the range of our missiles."" It was not clear whether Mr Hossein was reacting to a particular European action or speech but France has previously called for tough talks with Iran about its ballistic missile programme. Iran has repeatedly promised the programme is for its own defence. But the US says Iran is breaching international law, as some of its missiles could one day carry nuclear warheads, something Iran denies. Head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said in October that the country's 2,000km (1,240 mile) missile range covered ""most of American interest and forces"". ""Our missiles' range is 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles), and that can be increased, but we believe this range is enough for the Islamic Republic as most of the U.S. forces and most of their interests in the region are within this range,"" Jafari was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. ""Americans are trying to impose new sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards for its missile program, but that is an excuse to harm Iran's economy."" The US House of Representatives voted in October for new sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile programme. US President Donald Trump has called for allies to join him in stopping Iran's ""continued dangerous and destabilising behaviour""."

Among the dozens of people who attended the march in Hampstead, north London, was actress Emma Thompson who came to show her support despite suffering from pneumonia. She was taking part in the rally after Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family feared her situation has been made worse by comments made by the Foreign Secretary. The Sense and Sensibility actress said: ""If I can get out of bed with pneumonia, then Boris Johnson can get on a plane and go to Iran and get face to face with a problem that has been exacerbated by his own mistakes."" :: Richard Ratcliffe: My fight to free Nazanin from jail in Iran Mr Ratcliffe told Sky News that it was a ""happy day"" and it was great for his wife to hear how much support she had.

He says he is still hoping to accompany Boris Johnson on a visit to Iran before Christmas but it's ""not a guarantee"" he will get a visa in time for his wife's court case on 10 December. A group of mothers who attended the rally went on to deliver a letter which they hope to be sent on to the leader of Iran calling for clemency for the mother of one. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was able to tell her supporters she had been helping her daughter Gabrielle - who she sees twice a week for 45 minutes - write a letter to Father Christmas. Mr Ratcliffe says his daughter is no longer speaking much English but she ""likes seeing mummy on the television and goes up and kisses the screen"".

She told her supporters at the rally, it was the ""very small things that I put in my mind - many that I've still not done, that I never got round to"" that was keeping her going. ""It's been really, really tough,"" she told another friend. ""I'm so grateful for everybody's support. ""There is so much love and so much support. I never thought love could be so strong. I've never been so close (to people) that have been supporting me and who have loved me.

Campaigners have since called on Mr Johnson to take Mr Ratcliffe with him when he visits Iran before Christmas, allowing him to see his wife and daughter for the first time since she was held in April 2016.

""Of course, as soon as people heard the firing, they all started to run, some people climbed onto the platform, I saw them piled on top of each other, and they (the assailants) were hitting anybody and everybody, anybody who was breathing. ""I didn't see their numbers, I didn't see what they looked like, I could only feel their presence inside the mosque."" A stampede occurred as people rushed for an exit, while others tried desperately to force their way out of windows. When the violence finally stopped, more than 300 people were dead, including 27 children, and 128 others were injured. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack which is the deadliest in Egypt's modern history, but officials say the gunmen brandished an Islamic State flag as they opened fire. Al Rawdah mosque was largely attended by Sufi Muslims, a strand of Islam which militants consider heretic. On Saturday Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi declared three days of mourning and vowed to ""respond with brutal force"" to the atrocity. ""The army and police will avenge our martyrs and return security and stability with force in the coming short period,"" he said in a televised speech.

The Irish border is one of three issues that have to be resolved before the EU will allow talks to progress to discussions about future trade relations. The risk that customs posts and other controls could be established on roads into and out of Northern Ireland has emerged as the major obstacle to the EU approving the progression of negotiations when its leaders meet at a summit in a few weeks. It comes after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which controls the balance of power at Westminster, restated its determination there will be no effective moving of the border to the Irish Sea in an attempt to overcome the hard border problem. Some in the Irish government have suggested that a hard border could be avoided if Northern Ireland is given special status and remains in the customs union, even if the rest of the UK does not. But unionists are anxious that such an arrangement would create an ""internal barrier"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Mr Hogan said the solution may be for the UK to remain in the customs union - something that the most staunch Brexiteers in Theresa May's Cabinet and party are unlikely to accept. The Irish EU commissioner told The Observer newspaper it was a ""very simple fact"" that remaining in the single market and customs union would end the standoff, and Ireland will ""continue to play tough until the end"". He said: ""If the UK or Northern Ireland remained in the EU customs union, or better still the single market, there would be no border issue. That's a very simple fact. ""I continue to be amazed at the blind faith that some in London place in theoretical future free trade agreements (FTAs). ""First, the best possible FTA with the EU will fall far short of the benefits of being in the single market. This fact is simply not understood in the UK. ""Most real costs to cross-border business today are not tariffs - they are about standards, about customs procedures, about red tape. These are solved by the single market, but not in an FTA."" On Saturday, at the DUP conference, party leader Arlene Foster told delegates: ""We will not support any arrangements that create barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom or any suggestion that Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, will have to mirror European regulations."" Meanwhile, it has emerged the UK could be forced to adhere to any new EU regulations after it leaves the bloc, during any transition period. Theresa May set out proposals for a post-Brexit transition phase, when EU rules will continue to apply, when she addressed EU leaders in Florence in September. The Independent website says it has obtained policy documents drawn up by EU negotiator Michel Barnier which are thought to be a recommendation to the other 27 member states that a transition phase would involve ""automatic application in the UK of new EU rules post-30 March 2019"". Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, is among those who has said he would not be willing to accept further regulations from Brussels."

His account has fuelled speculation that the takeover by armed forces which led to the resignation of Mr Mugabe was not legal - despite a High Court judge backing it. :: Who is 'The Crocodile' Emmerson Mnangagwa? However, Mr Chombo and two leaders of the ruling Zanu-PF party's youth league who said they were abducted by the military before being handed over days later to the police, described experiences which point to human rights violations. The three men have been linked to a party faction loyal to Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, who is said to have been preparing to take over the presidency from her husband. ""I was in the custody of armed persons who were dressed in soldiers' uniforms,"" said Mr Chombo. ""I don't know where I was taken to."" :: Analysis: Huge challenges facing next leader :: New Zimbabwe leader Emmerson Mnangagwa praises Robert Mugabe in first address He said he had been blindfolded with his own T-shirt and taken out of his home through a broken window, sustaining injuries as he fell several times while barefoot. He said he was taken on an hour-long drive to a location where he spent days being interrogated and was told he had performed badly in his role as a government official and ruling party leader. He said he never saw his captors' faces because he was blindfolded most of the time. Eventually, his captors drove him home where two police cars were parked, waiting to arrest him. ""They said, 'you are under arrest',"" Mr Chombo said. Defence lawyer Lovemore Madhuku said his client's constitutional rights had been violated because he was not taken to court within 48 hours of his detention. He said it was obvious Mr Chombo was originally taken by state agents, probably the military. The police arrest, he said, was designed to provide legal cover for an illegal act. State prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba said the police arrest of Mr Chombo was lawful and that there was no evidence the ""armed men"" who previously held him belonged to the military."

Hundreds of people fled Oxford Circus Tube station on Friday just after 4.30pm, prompting numerous 999 calls to police reporting shots had been fired in the station and on Oxford Street. Shoppers, many screaming, were told to take cover in buildings on Europe's busiest shopping street as armed police stormed the area over fears of a terror attack. Dr Wilson, who has published studies on human fear conditioning, said: ""It was a perfect storm really: the prime time for shopping, a rather commercial kind of event, lots of tourists about. ""So, the anxiety about a terrorist attack would have been extremely high at that point. ""It just takes a minor incident to spark it off. ""An announcement that there's been an incident and people should make their way out - they begin to yell and scream. ""And of course the vulnerable people get trampled over when you get panic."" :: Oxford Street: What happened to cause 'terror' scare in central London? Various rumours quickly spread via social media, with some saying shots had been fired, while others said there had been a gang fight on the platform at Oxford Circus station. There were rumours that a bomb had gone off and some even said they had seen people who had been shot. An hour and a half after the first 999 call police stood down their response after firearms officers found nothing. Dr Wilson said people take to social media in situations like Friday's to ""impress their friends"" and reduce their own anxiety. He said: ""Social media always looks for the more dramatic side of things, people like to impress their friends about how they're in the centre of events, it's good for their own self-esteem. ""They also use social media as a way of reducing their own anxiety. Connecting with other people is a natural human urge when you're in absolute difficulty."" Several people were hurt and nine were taken to hospital, including one with leg injuries, after panic erupted in the packed station. British Transport Police (BTP) said they believe the incident started after an altercation erupted between two men on the platform at Oxford Circus station. They released pictures of two men they wanted to speak to over the mass evacuation and later tweeted that a 21-year-old and 40-year-old had both attended a police station voluntarily and had been interviewed. A BTP statement said: ""We understand that incidents like this cause panic and concern. ""We would therefore like to thank Londoners for their patience during this incident. Our officers will remain highly visible on duty this evening to reassure the public."""
2017-11-25,"The former pub chef jailed for murdering and raping model Sally Anne Bowman may have confessed to two further sex attacks to maintain ""a degree of notoriety"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/monster-mark-dixie-who-killed-sally-anne-bowman-jailed-for-more-sex-attacks-11141925,"Mark Dixie, 47, was handed two more life sentences after being jailed for a minimum of 34 years in 2008 for repeatedly stabbing the 18-year-old before raping her while she was either dead or dying in 2005 in south London. Over the course of 40 interviews, he confessed to two more attacks, including the rape of a woman when he was 16, after finally admitting to killing Miss Bowman in 2015. During his trial he denied murdering the teenager and claimed he had sex with her after finding her already dead or dying, but was still found guilty. On Friday, a judge at Southwark Crown Court sentenced Dixie to two life terms with a minimum of 28 years. The prosecution said he may have confessed to maintain ""a degree of notoriety"". His previous sentence meant he would not have been eligible for parole until 2040 - at the age of 69 - but the new sentence will add another four years. At an earlier hearing, Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC said he was ""satisfied"" that Dixie remained a ""serious danger to the public"". He said the father-of-three's offending had ""escalated significantly"" before he was jailed for the teenager's murder. Appearing by videolink from prison, he sat with his hands clasped in front of his face as his horrific crimes were outlined. Dixie's first victim was targeted in her own car in a south London car park in 1987. He tied her up before setting the car on fire but she was able to escape. The court was told he ""seemed delighted in her evident fear"" as she became hysterical during the ordeal. The second attack, in 2002, saw Dixie attack a woman with a chef's steel, used to sharpen kitchen knives, before molesting her. She managed to escape after being interrupted by a man who heard her screams. :: Sally Anne Bowman's killer Mark Dixie admits other sex attacks The court heard of another horrific sex attack in Australia and his barrister said Dixie had admitted to another sexual assault in Spain in 2005. After the sentencing, senior investigator Chris Le Pere branded the prolific offender a ""monster"". He added: ""We know he's offended in Australia, Spain and here, and I believe he's committed other serious offences here and abroad. ""I would appeal to anyone with information about Mark Dixie to come forward."""
2017-11-25,"Two of the world's best-known brands are withdrawing their advertising from YouTube and Google over fears they were featured on ""inappropriate"" and ""exploitative"" content featuring children. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/top-brands-pull-youtube-ads-over-paedophilia-fears-11141271,"Campaigners have warned that paedophiles were targeting the video-sharing website. The content, although legal and mostly uploaded by children themselves, is easily exploited by paedophile networks who are said to post messages and links to one another in the comments section underneath the videos. The clips are usually of boys and girls performing everyday activities in their homes. But sometimes the children can be seen partially clothed or in their nightwear. Investigators say paedophiles leave lewd comments or even try and encourage the children posting the videos to take part in private forum discussions. YouTube has been accused of failing to safeguard these children despite repeated warnings. Mars told Sky News: ""We are shocked and appalled to see that our adverts have appeared alongside such exploitative and inappropriate content. It is in stark contrast to who we are and what we believe. ""We have taken the decision to immediately suspend all our online advertising on YouTube and Google globally. ""We have stringent guidelines and processes in place and are working with Google and our media buying agencies to understand what went wrong. ""Until we have confidence that appropriate safeguards are in place, we will not advertise on You Tube and Google."" Sportswear manufacturer Adidas told Sky News that it was in urgent talks with YouTube and would suspend all its advertising until the issue had been resolved. It said: ""Adidas takes this issue very seriously and were completely unaware that this situation had arisen on YouTube today. ""We recognise that this situation is clearly unacceptable and have taken immediate action, working closely with Google on all necessary steps to prevent this from happening again. ""We will work with our media agencies and directly with Google to ensure that all future programmatic media buying is closely monitored and everything is done in the future to avoid any reoccurrences of this situation."" YouTube admitted it needed to do more, stating: ""Content that endangers children is abhorrent and unacceptable to us. ""We have clear policies against videos and comments on YouTube which sexualise or exploit children and we enforce them aggressively whenever alerted to such content. ""We have recently toughened our approach to videos and comments featuring children which may not be illegal, but give cause for concern. ""We also work closely with the Internet Watch Foundation, NCMEC and others to prevent child sexual abuse imagery from ever being uploaded and report it to law enforcement. ""We are committed to getting this right and recognise we need to do more, both through machine learning and by increasing human and technical resources."" The decision by Mars to pull its advertising will put Google and YouTube under renewed pressure to ensure children who upload content to its website are better protected. More companies including Amazon and eBay are thought to be reviewing their positions too. That could amount to millions of pounds in lost advertising revenue. A spokesperson for Diageo said: ""We are deeply concerned and are investigating this as a matter of urgency. We always insist that our media providers adhere to the most stringent of precautions to ensure our brands do not appear next to inappropriate content. ""As a consequence, we are enforcing an immediate stop of all YouTube advertising until we are confident the appropriate safeguards are in place. We are committed to the highest standards of marketing and have zero tolerance for any circumstances that fall below our strict marketing codes."" Sky News understands all Adidas adverts appearing on these videos have already been taken down. YouTube says it is in the process of removing all adverts on inappropriate content: It said: ""There shouldn't be any ads running on this content and we are working urgently to fix this. Over the past year, we have been working to ensure that YouTube is a safe place for brands. ""While we have made significant changes in product, policy, enforcement and controls, we will continue to improve."""
2017-11-25,Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has reacted with anger after the Government suggested it may not pay the full costs of the Manchester Arena bombing.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/anger-over-pms-failure-to-commit-to-manchester-arena-attack-costs-11141705,"The city had requested help after estimating it had been left with more than Â£17m in extra costs after the terror attack on 22 May, when 22 people were killed and hundreds injured. Mr Burnham revealed he has now received a letter from Theresa May stating that ""reasonable costs"" will be paid, causing him to angrily demand the full costs be met. Speaking at a meeting of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority on Friday, Mr Burnham interrupted planned proceedings to reveal the news. He said: ""As this meeting has been progressing, I have received a letter from the Prime Minister in relation to the issue I raised around the reimbursement of costs incurred as a result of the attack at the arena. ""While there is going to be a need to look at it carefully - and there is some commitment in it - particularly on the position of police costs, there is no commitment in the letter unfortunately. ""Only a commitment that the costs we've submitted will be looked at and that 'reasonable costs' will be paid, which doesn't sound satisfactory to me."" Mr Burnham claimed Manchester was ""entitled to a better response than this"" having ""waited long enough"" for a reply. ""I don't think we should hold back in saying that we feel this needs to be resolved and resolved quickly,"" he added. ""And, indeed, rather than just 'reasonable costs', all costs incurred as a result should be reimbursed."" Earlier in the meeting, Mr Burnham had criticised the lack of mention in Wednesday's Budget on police, security or counter-terrorism funding. He said the absence of a funding boost by Chancellor Philip Hammond means Greater Manchester Police is set for a real terms cut in the coming year. The PM told me âmajorityâ. It really does need to be ALL. This is what the government said at the time. Iâve tabled a further parliamentary question on this for answer by Monday. https://t.co/5pvG2duCzH The city's authority and local health and police services are seeking reimbursement from Westminster related to the costs incurred by the Manchester Arena atrocity. Mr Burnham went on to tell Sky News that it ""leaves a hole in the finances of our public services"" and questioned: ""How do we fill that hole?"" He added: ""We need to make sure that the residents of Greater Manchester don't lose out."" Also responding to Friday's news, Labour's Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell said she will demand an answer from ministers in Parliament on Monday. Earlier this month, Ms Powell tackled the Prime Minister in the House of Commons over the wait for the costs of the Manchester terror attack to be reimbursed by central Government. At the time, Mrs May said she expected the Government's response ""to confirm that the majority of funds will be made available"". On Friday, a Government spokesperson said: ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring the victims of this terrible attack and Greater Manchester have all possible support. ""We have given strong assurance Manchester will receive Â£12m. That includes Â£3m being paid now and a further Â£1m being made available to support the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. ""This is an ongoing process and the Government stands by its commitment to provide all necessary further assistance."""

The amphitheatre in the Prince Albert Gardens in Swanage, Dorset, where Gaia lived, was illuminated with candles lit in her memory. They were placed in glass jars next to flowers which spelled out the teenager's name below a framed picture of her. A playlist of Gaia's favourite songs was played after readings from friends and family sharing their memories. Her cousin, Marienna, said: ""It breaks my heart to think how much she still had to give the world which she was determined to change for the better. She was a powerful young woman and it was well within her reach."" Gaia Pope, who suffered from severe epilepsy, disappeared on 7 November, sparking a campaign to find her. Her body was found 11 days later close to a cliff edge near Swanage. A post-mortem examination suggested nobody else was involved in her death, and three people who had been arrested in connection with her disappearance were released. Her death is being treated as unexplained."
2017-11-25,Artisan cider producers are concerned that a new levy could have a devastating impact on the industry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171126085118/https://news.sky.com/story/artisan-cider-makers-fear-new-binge-drinking-levy-11144607,"The legislation, to be brought in from February, would see a duty introduced on ciders with an alcohol content of between 6.9% and 7.5%. It was announced in the Budget and is aimed at cracking down on binge drinking. The target is white cider - paler in colour, cheap, with a high alcohol content, and often associated with street and underage binge drinking. But some traditional cider makers, who have been in the industry for decades, insist they will also be affected. Barny Butterfield runs Sandford Orchards in Devon, the oldest working cider shed in the country. He believes the levy could push prices up on some traditional ciders. Mr Butterfield told Sky News: ""As always when the government tries to intervene in small and fragile markets, which cider certainly is, they have changed the rules as to how alcohol is allowed to be made and that may affect a lot of growers, who make full strength ciders... I worry that there is now a law of unintended consequences."" Introducing the duty, Philip Hammond said he wanted to tackle ""excessive consumption by the most vulnerable people"". Alcohol Concern has, in the past, said super strength cider is becoming like heroine among alcoholics and many campaigners and homeless charities have called for it not to be sold in anything bigger than a litre bottle. MP Fiona Bruce is among those who welcome the duty. She said: ""Most of the craft cider industry won't be affected. ""What we are hoping is that producers will look at reformulating the alcohol content in cider and just reduce it enough to come under the alcohol duty band. ""That will encourage people to drink cider at a lower alcohol content, which is what also happened with beer."" But producers like Mr Butterworth don't believe the levy will have any effect, insisting it has only been introduced to make the Government look good. He says cheaper cider contains more sugar and less juice, and a tax would therefore mean that even more inexpensive ingredients, such as syrup, are used to increase profit margins. The Government insists the levy will only affect around 11.5% of the market. And of that, 78% is white cider. It also insists that most artisan producers make less than 70 hectolitres of cider a year, and will therefore be exempt from the duty. For the majority of drinkers the Budget was positive news in that most alcohol won't cost a penny more. But many cider producers are warning that if a new tax is introduced next year it could have a devastating impact on them, even putting them out of business."

The Irish border is one of three issues that have to be resolved before the EU will allow talks to progress to discussions about future trade relations. The risk that customs posts and other controls could be established on roads into and out of Northern Ireland has emerged as the major obstacle to the EU approving the progression of negotiations when its leaders meet at a summit in a few weeks. It comes after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which controls the balance of power at Westminster, restated its determination there will be no effective moving of the border to the Irish Sea in an attempt to overcome the hard border problem. Some in the Irish government have suggested that a hard border could be avoided if Northern Ireland is given special status and remains in the customs union, even if the rest of the UK does not. But unionists are anxious that such an arrangement would create an ""internal barrier"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Mr Hogan said the solution may be for the UK to remain in the customs union - something that the most staunch Brexiteers in Theresa May's Cabinet and party are unlikely to accept. The Irish EU commissioner told The Observer newspaper it was a ""very simple fact"" that remaining in the single market and customs union would end the standoff, and Ireland will ""continue to play tough until the end"". He said: ""If the UK or Northern Ireland remained in the EU customs union, or better still the single market, there would be no border issue. That's a very simple fact. ""I continue to be amazed at the blind faith that some in London place in theoretical future free trade agreements (FTAs). ""First, the best possible FTA with the EU will fall far short of the benefits of being in the single market. This fact is simply not understood in the UK. ""Most real costs to cross-border business today are not tariffs - they are about standards, about customs procedures, about red tape. These are solved by the single market, but not in an FTA."" On Saturday, at the DUP conference, party leader Arlene Foster told delegates: ""We will not support any arrangements that create barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom or any suggestion that Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, will have to mirror European regulations."" Meanwhile, it has emerged the UK could be forced to adhere to any new EU regulations after it leaves the bloc, during any transition period. Theresa May set out proposals for a post-Brexit transition phase, when EU rules will continue to apply, when she addressed EU leaders in Florence in September. The Independent website says it has obtained policy documents drawn up by EU negotiator Michel Barnier which are thought to be a recommendation to the other 27 member states that a transition phase would involve ""automatic application in the UK of new EU rules post-30 March 2019"". Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, is among those who has said he would not be willing to accept further regulations from Brussels."

The son of Mr Mugabe's late sister Sabina told the AFP news agency: ""He is fine. I have been to see him, he is quite jovial. ""He is actually looking forward to his new life - farming and staying at the rural home. He has taken it well."" He did not address reports the former president was given a $10m retirement bonus as part of a deal that persuaded him to resign earlier this week after 37 years in power. Leo added that Mr Mugabe's wife Grace, who was being positioned to succeed her husband before the military intervened, is concentrating on plans to build a university in his honour. ""I like the spirit she has, she is with him all the time. She is an amazing person. She wants to continue planning the Robert Mugabe University so they have something to do,"" Leo said. Controversial plans for a $1bn post-graduate university in Mazowe, 20 miles from the capital Harare, were announced in August. On the terms of exit settlement, the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper has reported that Mr Mugabe was given a $10m lump sum, immunity from prosecution and allowed to keep his assets. He will still get his full salary, in line with the constitution, while Mrs Mugabe will reportedly receive half her husband's pay after his death. Asked about the deal, Mr Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba said that ""the package of a retiring president will be defined (by) law"". He said immunity had never come up during the talks between Mr Mugabe and the army chiefs who briefly put him under house arrest. The current whereabouts of Mr and Mrs Mugabe are not known. The chain of events that led to Mr Mugabe's downfall was sparked when he sacked his vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. This prompted the military to intervene and usher in Mr Mnangagwa as Mr Mugabe's successor. Known as ""The Crocodile"", Zimbabwe's new leader has vowed to bring in sweeping changes to jump-start the nation's struggling economy. He also paid tribute to Mr Mugabe in his inaugural address, describing him as one of the ""founding fathers of our nation"". But critics have expressed fears Mr Mnangagwa - who has been accused of overseeing violence and ethnic massacres - could prove to be just as authoritarian as Mr Mugabe."

""We are following a strategic doctrine. ""So far we have felt that Europe is not a threat, so we did not increase the range of our missiles. ""But if Europe wants to turn into a threat, we will increase the range of our missiles."" It was not clear whether Mr Hossein was reacting to a particular European action or speech but France has previously called for tough talks with Iran about its ballistic missile programme. Iran has repeatedly promised the programme is for its own defence. But the US says Iran is breaching international law, as some of its missiles could one day carry nuclear warheads, something Iran denies. Head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said in October that the country's 2,000km (1,240 mile) missile range covered ""most of American interest and forces"". ""Our missiles' range is 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles), and that can be increased, but we believe this range is enough for the Islamic Republic as most of the U.S. forces and most of their interests in the region are within this range,"" Jafari was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. ""Americans are trying to impose new sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards for its missile program, but that is an excuse to harm Iran's economy."" The US House of Representatives voted in October for new sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile programme. US President Donald Trump has called for allies to join him in stopping Iran's ""continued dangerous and destabilising behaviour""."

But some experts have doubts over the impact of such events, which are often now spread over a number of days rather than taking place on just one. Figures from data analysts Springboard showed footfall at shopping locations was down 3.6% on Black Friday last week - more than the expected decline of 0.6%. In high streets, the decline was 4.2%. Its report said the squeeze on household income as inflation and interest rates rise was one factor but that there was also the fact that many shops were on sale before Friday. :: Why Britain has embraced Black Friday Springboard also said there was growing recognition among consumers that many discounts continue and even increase after Black Friday. Meanwhile, retailers were promoting more and more offers online rather than in store. The report predicted further footfall of 4% on Cyber Monday. Separate figures from VoucherCodes and the Centre for Retail Research predicted that 21.5 million people would head online for Cyber Monday bargains. They forecast that Â£7.8bn would be spent over the four-day period, up 7% on last year. Department store John Lewis said on Friday that it had seen its biggest ever hour of online trading, with 705 units purchased per minute on average between 9am and 10am - with ""iPad"" the number one search term."

Britain ranks fifth out of G7 industrial nations, behind Canada and Japan, on productivity. Mr Clarke said the country should ""seize"" the benefits of a ""new industrial revolution"". He added: ""This would be needed at any time, and Britain's decision to leave the European Union makes it even more important."" The announcement includes news of a major pharmaceutical company opening a ""world-leading"" life-sciences campus in northwest England. It will support 900 jobs, with the potential for 800 more to be created at the firm's current headquarters in Manchester. MSD, known internationally as Merck and Co., will use the new hub for research into treatments and medicines. The Government hopes to use the news to allay concerns about the pharmaceutical industry's future post-Brexit. Numerous bodies voiced concern when the new homes of two London-based EU authorities, including the European Medical Agency, were announced. Their departure means the loss of over 1,000 jobs, and tens of thousands of researchers and staff from companies visiting the institutions going elsewhere. Merck has also previously attracted criticism for paying an academic publisher to print favourable articles about it, without indicating the content was sponsored. The publisher later admitted the practice was ""unacceptable"" and that the journal - sent to tens of thousands of Australian doctors - lacked ""the proper disclosures"". Merck argued that the articles had been reprinted from peer-reviewed journals. In 2004, it was also engulfed in a scandal about a painkiller - Vioxx - linked to heart attacks. It paid $4.85bn (Â£3.6bn) to settle a majority of lawsuits brought against it, but avoided the up-to $30bn payout some analysts predicted. Dr Roger Perlmutter, MSD's research laboratories president, said of the new investment announcement: ""Strong discovery capabilities and the pursuit of scientific excellence are foundational to MSD's mission to save and improve lives around the world. ""A new UK location will enable us to build on our proud legacy of invention and be an important contributor to the vibrant and rapidly growing UK life sciences community, while providing access for more collaborations within the European life science ecosystem."" Meanwhile, analysis by Labour has found that the UK economy only will be 1.4% more productive in 2017 compared to 2007, the pre-crisis peak, putting UK productivity growth at its slowest rate since electricity was invented. Commenting on the figures, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour's shadow secretary for business, energy and industrial strategy, said: ""The Conservatives' failed economic agenda has stifled productivity and held Britain back. ""The shocking state of the economy is down to austerity, and a chronic lack of investment over the last seven years. ""The Conservatives have done untold damage to our economy and its capacity to lift productivity and living standards. The next Labour government will invest in the skills and infrastructure our country so badly needs."""
2017-11-26,Two falling meteors resulting in blazing fireballs have been seen widely in the skies over southern England.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171127090409/https://news.sky.com/story/blazing-fireballs-seen-over-southern-england-by-dozens-of-people-11144777,"Dozens of people reported seeing the objects across England, Wales and northern France just after midnight on Saturday and the following morning. Several people captured video or photos showing large bright objects appearing to flare up and then recede in the night or early morning sky. The first sighting was just after midnight on Saturday with the majority of people from the UK Meteor Observation Network (UKMON) and the American Meteor Society (AMS) viewing it in south or southeast England. It was categorised as a bolide, which is the technical definition of a meteor that results in a flash as bright as the moon. The second came seven hours later with most reports from people who contacted UKMON and AMS coming in from south and southwest England and South Wales. A handful of those who reported seeing the fireball at midnight said it produced a sound, with one describing it as a ""rumble or multiple booms lasting 2-3 seconds"". Others said they could hear no sound. Richard Fleet, a member of UKMON, told Sky News the first fireball was the second brightest fireball seen in the UK for three years. ""It was probably a few kilograms of material,"" Mr Fleet, from Wilcot, Wiltshire, said. ""It would have been coming in at about 20 kilometres per second (km/s). The Space Station is moving at about 8km/s. ""There are multiple flashes as it breaks up. It would have happened at about an altitude of about 30km. ""It was bright but nothing like the one that broke up over Chelyabinsk (in Russia). That one would have been about 15 metres across. This one about 15cm."" Someone calling themselves Sol C on the AMS website said: ""It was so quick and I was inside my house looking out the window. Initially thought it was a firework but there was no firework sound and my friend next to me saw it too."" Spence J, in Culmhead, Somerset, described it as a ""very high elevation bright greenish light and terminal flash that lit up night-time countryside and the few clouds in the area. Didn't get a good look at it as I was driving at the time and it seemed to come over from behind me."" After witnessing the 7.15am UK time fireball on Saturday, Christmas T told the AMS website: ""Wow never seen anything like it before."" Almost all reported that the later fireball was not accompanied by sound but over half said the object appeared to break up as it came towards Earth. Fred T said: ""I was inside so my field of view was somewhat restricted. It was significantly brighter/bigger than anything I'd seen before (eg ""shooting star""), esp as in full daylight."" Mr Fleet said the appearance in the sky of the fireballs and a subsequent fireball seen over France on Saturday night was coincidental and they were not related.

Mr Appfjell, who said he was ""dizzy with anger"", said the worst incident happened on Saturday when 65 animals were mown down. The herder, who looks after around 2,000 reindeer in Helgeland in the North of the country, said 106 reindeer have been killed since Thursday. At least 250 reindeer were killed by trains over the last 12 months. Led by their herders, groups of animals have been migrating from their summer pasture in the mountainous regions towards the coast. But as they head towards their winter home, many have been caught on the train tracks dividing their route. Warnings for trains to drive slowly through the migration area failed to reach the drivers due to ""a technical failure"", according to Norwegian news website NRK. Local train operator, Bane Nor has now reduced the speed of their vehicles in the area, according to local media. Local residents, who say the slaughter of the reindeer on the tracks happens every year, are calling for a barrier to be built along the rails to protect the migrating animals."

""Plumes of smoke are occasionally accompanied by explosive eruptions and the sound of weak blasts that can be heard up to 12km (7m) from the peak,"" the Disaster Mitigation Agency said in a statement after raising the alert level from three to four. ""The potential for a larger eruption is imminent,"" it said. The airport in Bali's capital, Denpasar, a top holiday destination that attracts millions of tourists every year, has been closed, causing around 2,000 passengers - mostly from Australia - to become stranded. In response, the Australian government advised its nationals to ""exercise a high degree of caution in Indonesia"" and ""follow the instructions of authorities"". Plumes of ash and steam as high as 13,000ft (4,000 metres) have been pouring out of Mount Agung since Tuesday. Gede Suantika, an official at the disaster mitigation agency, said: ""The activity of Mount Agung has entered the magmatic eruption phase. ""It is still spewing ash at the moment, but we need to monitor and be cautious over the possibility of a strong, explosive eruption."" Mount Agung is one of more than 120 active volcanoes extending the length of Indonesia that sits on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire. It last erupted in 1963, killing about 1,600 people. Mount Agung rumbled back to life in September and authorities raised the alert to the highest level, forcing 140,000 people to evacuate. The volcano's activity decreased in late October and many people returned to their home as the alert was lowered to the second-highest level. But Mount Agung started rumbling again last week."

2017-11-26,Parliament's close procedural combat over Brexit has begun in earnest. All-night sittings and all-out battles between and within parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171127090409/https://news.sky.com/story/twin-tightropes-for-theresa-may-amid-mps-close-brexit-combat-11126950,"It began surreally enough, with Labour's backbench Brexiteer Frank Field arguing about the precise hour of Brexit. His proposed amendment came not from a desire to stay in the EU an extra hour, even though that would be the consequence. For Mr Field, it was the principle that leaving the EU should occur at midnight Greenwich Mean Time and not Brussels time, as conceded by the Government to keep within the contours of Article 50 - a function of EU law. Given only a tiny fraction of 464 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated and voted upon, it could well be argued that spending a couple of hours debating an extra hour in the EU was not the best use of time. The Government had issues with its own much-heralded exit date amendment - with some concern among Conservative backbenchers that this clause was not quite as advertised. Tory MPs believe that other consequential amendments have the effect of leaving to ministers just how much of the EU the UK leaves on exit day. It was enough to trouble backbench Brexiteers about whether they were being sold out by the Government they support. No, said the minister Steve Baker - the date would be fixed at 29 March 2019 at 11pm. It is not a surprise the Opposition called on the Government to withdraw what they called an exit day ""gimmick"". Nor that there are Tory MPs who disagree. Backbenchers such as Dominic Grieve are frustrated at what he said was a disingenuous and dishonest debate that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end during a transition period. It was Ken Clarke who seemed to command the anti-Brexit forces in the House of Commons. But the Government is likely to be as greatly concerned by the tone of the debate, as of the 20 or so Tory MPs infuriated by ministers' setting of an inflexible exit date. Some Conservative backbenchers were witheringly contemptuous of the ""mad"" and ""silly"" exit date amendment, which Mr Clarke referred to as a ""sop to the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary"" - as he picked out Vote Leave figureheads Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. At times, the rebellious Remain rabble simply laughed out loud at the injunctions of their colleagues. There is now a growing band of Conservative MPs who seem unwilling to be bound by the approach of their Government. And yet, on a day when the Government defeated this first set of less contentious amendments, it might just be that across the Palace of Westminster, at the Business Select Committee, was where the real issue lay. Because as MPs pondered which time zone Britain should use to leave the EU, car makers pronounced they were running out of it. We already know about the uncertainty around customs arrangements and possible tariffs. But a representative of Honda, owners of a giant factory in Swindon, expressed doubt that after a ""no deal"" Brexit, the UK's vehicle type approvals from the Vehicle Certification Agency would be accepted across Europe. The chief financial officer of Aston Martin suggested this could lead to a ""semi-catastrophic"" production stop as new certifications were sought for new and existing cars. These are the twin tightropes upon which Theresa May treads. Day one was the easy bit."

Speaking on a visit to New Zealand, he told Sky's Sunday with Niall Paterson: ""The UK is going to be leaving the customs union and the single market. ""We've always had exceptions for Ireland - whether it's in voting rights or residence rights in the UK - we've always accepted a certain asymmetry. ""That will have to be part of whatever agreement we come to with the EU. ""But we can't get a final answer to the Irish question until we get an idea of the end state - and until we get into discussions with the EU on the end state that will be very difficult. ""So the quicker we can do that the better. He added: ""We're still in the position where the EU doesn't want to do that and we're getting quite close now to 2018, when we'll be talking about 'next year' when we leave the EU. ""So for all the reasons - international as well as European - I think we have to get there faster than we're doing at the present time."" The comments risk further splits with Ireland, after the Republic's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned he would block Brexit negotiations moving on to trade unless a formal guarantee of no hard border was received. Sky's Europe Correspondent Mark Stone said: ""If he sticks by this, and the EU doesn't move either then it is certain that 'sufficient progress' on divorce won't be given in December. So trade talks won't begin - disaster for business and citizens."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was ""worried"" about the comments. He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""I think the one thing that we don't want to do is jeopardise any movement quickly, because we need movement to enable us to get into the proper trade negotiations. ""So I'm hoping that isn't a Downing Street sanctioned statement that's he's made."" It came after Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable told Sky News there was a 20% chance Brexit ""won't happen"". He said: ""There is a distinct possibility Brexit won't happen. I would currently put the chances at about 20%, but that is likely to become greater."""
2017-11-26,"When pondering the long and often troublesome relationship between Britain and Ireland in the early 20th century, someone once said that Britain's problem was that it always looked at Ireland ""through the wrong end of a telescope"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171127090409/https://news.sky.com/story/ireland-the-brexit-riddle-britain-forgot-11145289,"It could neither see its people, nor what they wanted, properly. Given the events of the past few weeks and months, the charge against many British politicians must be considerably worse since then: these days, they don't bother to look or think about Ireland all. But we're thinking about it now. Because it is Ireland, not money, which threatens to destabilise the Prime Minister's negotiations. Ireland has the power of veto over Britain moving onto the next stage of trade negotiations, which it has said it will use if it is not satisfied that the Brexit settlement won't make the border in Northern Ireland less porous. We now have less than 10 days to sort the problem before December's EU summit. Many in Westminster's media and political class have seemed surprised at Ireland's perceived truculence. They shouldn't have been, if they'd been paying attention to what the Irish government has been saying for months, it's clear the writing has long been on the wall. The typical British response to the situation in Ireland has been perfunctory and, at times, bordering on insouciant: usually going along the lines of ""where there's a will there's a way"". ""Ireland will sort itself out."" The competing narratives of this question apparently extend up to and including the leaders of both countries themselves. So much so that, at an EU summit in Gothenburg last week, Theresa May is reputed to have told Leo Varadkar that ""we are close"" on a deal - to which the Taoiseach responded that this was ""fantasy"". Indeed he told me in an interview later that day that the two sides were ""nowhere near close"". This situation we find ourselves in now stretches back to the referendum. During the campaign, aside from a few game attempts by former prime ministers (and architects of the Good Friday Agreement both) John Major and Tony Blair to discuss it, Ireland - and the issues pertaining to the border which Brexit would inevitably involve - barely got a look in on the mainland. Given that Brexit might imperil the hard won political stability of one of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom, that is extraordinary. That curious and ahistorical attitude stretched up to the then Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers herself. Thus the Irish and British public were treated to the bizarre spectacle of a British Northern Ireland Secretary publicly advocating and campaigning for a political outcome which, whatever its overall rights and wrongs, would almost certainly lead to a destabilisation of the political situation and stability in the region for which she was responsible. The situation since has not been much better. There is perhaps no finer example of the Anglo-shrug of all matters Irish than the much vaunted 4,000 word article by the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Brexit, which he wrote before the Conservative party conference. 4,000 words of his usual glittering penmanship. Not one word about Ireland. How are we to explain that? Especially from politicians of the Conservative and Unionist party, of all things? In some ways it involves the passing of time. The darkness and damage of the Troubles, to many of us on the mainland at least, seem remote and distant. The Good Friday Agreement has been almost too successful: it has allowed us to put Northern Ireland's troubles in a box marked ""history"". It has thus apparently given way to a deep complacency amongst a generation of politicians who assume things will be fine in the end. Some, perhaps more troublingly, are aware of the risk but ultimately care about Brexit more than Ireland - and are therefore willing to roll the Irish dice to get it. In some ways, in terms of our ignorance of matters Irish, t'was ever thus. Britain has generally ignored its smaller neighbour until its problems proved so great that it had little choice but to confront them. But there's a difference this time: for the first time, with its veto, Ireland has serious power over her larger neighbour. They have the power to unlock something we desperately want - but the Irish key looks nearly impossible to obtain. The Irish government has been clear that they will not accept any situation where the border is any harder than it is at the moment. To that end they have suggested that the best option (as reiterated today by Irish EU Commissioner Phil Hogan) is for the UK to stay in the customs union and preferably the single market too. But the British government has also been clear since the PM made her Lancaster House speech in January: we are leaving both. To resile from that would not be tolerated by her backbenches or indeed, many in her cabinet. Ireland has therefore suggested some sort of special status for Northern Ireland. Perhaps the province could stay in the customs union and single market. That, however, has been rejected by the DUP for the obvious reason that Northern Ireland would become more closely bound to the Republic and the rest of the EU and slowly drift away from Britain (by far the country's biggest export market). The truth is much of the Brexiteer argument on Ireland was always rather woolly. For a start many of those who currently say that the Irish situation will be fine in the end do so in the same breath as saying that a No Deal outcome is possible - and some even say that it is desirable. In the case of a ""no deal"", we would conduct only WTO trading with Ireland and the UK would be duty-bound to erect the hardest of hard borders on goods between north and south. It would be the biggest threat to the peace process possible. The other contradiction lies at the heart of the Brexit Ireland paradox itself. Adherents of Brexit usually claim it is a huge economic and political revolution. At the same time they say things in Ireland can remain more or less the same as they are now. It cannot be both. After all, what is the point of Brexit if we cannot take back control of our borders? In order to do so, we must have a border with the EU. One of those borders will be in Ireland. The government is trying to find a good answer to an impossible riddle. Sometimes, goodwill isn't enough. Ministers are fond of pointing out Britain and Ireland enjoyed the fruits of the common travel area and free trade with Ireland long before we joined the EU. That is true. But they forget it is no co-incidence that Britain and Ireland joined the EU on the same day. If one had been part of a common market with Europe and the other hadn't, that would have exacerbated the already considerable divides which existed at that time. In leaving the EU now, for the first time in our modern histories, Ireland and Britain will be operating under different regulatory regimes. This is uncharted territory. And we ought to remember too that EU membership was written into the particulars of the Good Friday Agreement. The agreement depended on a perfect equilibrium which EU membership provided. Being in the same travel area, the same single market, the same customs union, the same overarching political confederation meant that both sides felt that the province had a political foot in both camps, one in Britain, one in the Republic. The future was obtainable to both sides. It gave the unionists certainty of Ulster's links with the UK but also tantalisingly gave nationalists the hope that, however distant, Northern Ireland might slowly economically and politically drift south as their political and economic systems converged. That is why the prospect of a hard border is so unacceptable to the Irish government now: It entirely cuts that off. And on a personal level too, as Irish writer Fintan O'Toole has persuasively argued, the EU facilitated a pick and mix approach to identity for those in the province. Identities became fluid, shared and particular. Brexit - once again - forces people to choose. We've already seen some of the old acrimonies reappear. A war of words has broken out between the north and south. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has warned Leo Varadkar ""he should know better"" and ""stop playing around with Northern Ireland."" DUP MP Sammy Wilson accused the Irish government of trying to thwart the Brexit process. The Irish government has been no less vituperative. More worryingly still some of the vitriol is spreading to the press. The Sun newspaper recently instructed the Irish Taoiseach to ""shut his gob"". This can't all come down to the British, the Irish will have to give to. They have nothing to gain from Britain leaving the EU without a deal which would create the very hard border they are desperate to see avoided. But their problems have been made worse by political instability in Ireland. The country could yet face a general election as a result of a domestic political scandal before Christmas. That would make it even more difficult for Leo Varadkar to compromise. He will face considerable domestic political pressure to continue to play hardball. From their point of view it is the British who have decided to Brexit, it is for them, not the Irish to come up with a solution. And no-one has come up with any solution which answers the problems. Someone is going to lose. I fear that, when the history of this period and the Brexit process is written, it might not be the ins and outs of trade or courts and citizens' rights over which historians linger long, but the effects on the peace settlement in Ireland. An outcome no-one wants seems now inescapable. I hope I'm wrong. The situation may yet be resolved. Either way, I doubt that twenty or thirty years ago we would have treated the situation there with such abandon or showed such lack of interest. And so the insouciant shrug of the shoulders will no longer do. The Irish issue was the referendum issue which did not bark. It's barking now. We must answer its call and do it urgently and convincingly. As John Major said before the referendum, the hard men of the Troubles are still there. They are waiting and rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of a breakdown in the peace process. They are lying in wait. The British government must make sure they never return. That might come at a cost of Brexit purity or the speed of Brexit or its form but ultimately the Queen's peace, on the mainland and in Ulster must come first. W.B. Yeats, that greatest of Irishmen, more alive to the subtleties and nuance of the Anglo-Irish relationship than almost anyone, once wrote that :""Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy..."". I wonder just how far away we might be from things falling apart. Lest they do we need to reach for our Irish telescope. Let's hope our politicians, on both sides, hold it the right way round."

It is traditionally performed by one of the five Foot Guards Regiments from the Army's Household Division, but crowds gathered on Sunday to watch 86 sailors carry out the intricate routine following a month of practice. The sailors trained at the Royal Navy's headquarters in Portsmouth, with their new skills being polished by drill instructors from the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards. They marched through the famous gates to the theme tune of Game of Thrones, watched by thousands of tourists. Ahead of the ceremony, warrant officer 1st Class Eddie Wearing, the Royal Navy's state ceremonial training officer, said: ""It's daunting, but I'm very excited. ""To be the conducting warrant officer for the first mount ever in the Royal Navy is a massive privilege and an honour to do. I'm really looking forward to it."" The roots of the Changing the Guard ceremony can be traced back to the reign of Henry VII when the first royal bodyguard was created. But a group of soldiers from the Grenadier Guards, one of the five Foot Guards Regiments, were not worried they would be upstaged. One said: ""We've been doing it for 300 years.

2017-11-26,These are difficult times for the pub industry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171127090409/https://news.sky.com/story/beer-boss-balks-at-unprecedented-cost-pressures-in-pub-sector-11141528,"The rate of closures has slowed down, from 29 per week several years ago to 21 per week now, but trading remains tough. Pub prices remain high compared with cheap supermarket beer, while the competitive threat from supermarkets is exacerbated by the fact that food sold in pubs is subject to VAT, while food sold in supermarkets is not. Many regular drinkers, who were driven away from pubs by the smoking ban in 2007, still prefer to drink - and smoke - at home. Business rates, meanwhile, remain such a perennial bugbear that the Treasury has had to provide pubs with specific reliefs - renewed this week by the Chancellor in his Budget - to help dull the pain. Societal changes have also contributed, including a switch from beer to wine among many drinkers and a drop in popularity among younger consumers, with one in six people aged between 18-25 are reckoned to be teetotal. And now, with earnings growth again starting to lag inflation, disposable incomes are again under pressure. There is an additional factor in London. The Economist magazine recently published analysis showing that pub closures in the capital had been particularly marked, which it said was partly because London was over-saturated with pubs to begin with and also because of the growing concentration in some boroughs of Muslims, whose religion forbids them from drinking alcohol. Under those circumstances, today's half year results from Fuller, Smith & Turner, the Chiswick-based pub operator and brewer of beers such as London Pride, are pretty creditable. Half year sales rose by 6%, to Â£209.3m, while pre-tax profits on an underlying basis rose by 4% to Â£23.8m. Within that, sales and profits in Fuller's managed pub and hotel business, which now account for almost two-thirds of group profits, were up by 7% and 6% respectively. Sales in the brewing operation, whose other brands include Honeydew, Seafarers, ESB and Frontier Craft Lager, were up 5%, but operating profits fell by 13%, which the company blamed on increasing marketing spending and a pincer attack from rivals. At one end of the market, the global mega-brewers have been cutting prices aggressively, while at the other, independent craft brewers have been benefiting from lower levels of beer duty than their larger rivals. So Fullers has been caught in the middle. Yet the pressure is still there. Simon Emeny, the chief executive, pointed out today: ""The last six months have seen some unprecedented influences on the business, not only in our particular industry, but in the context of the wider UK economy and global political scene. ""I cannot remember a time when we have faced such an array of additional cost pressures, particularly in our managed pubs, starting with the 26% rise in business rates. The pub sector is now responsible for 2.8% of the total business rates bill, despite only generating just 0.5% of total turnover. ""Over and above this increase, we have met with rises in the Apprenticeship Levy and Living Wage rates."" Fuller's is not the only pub operator warning of tough conditions. On Thursday, Mitchells & Butlers - owner of the Miller & Carter, Toby Carvery, All Bar One, O'Neill's and Harvester chains - announced it would not be paying a half-year dividend next year, flagging higher costs as a result of the drop in the pound, while also warning that it could face staffing shortages depending on changes to immigration and employment laws as Britain leaves the EU. There was this warning, too, from the pub operator Youngs last week: ""The political environment remains predictable and this ongoing uncertainty is unhelpful when it comes to the strength of the broader economy."" It, too, flagged concerns over Brexit. But are pub customers really being deterred from popping to their local due to fears that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, may be putting one over on David Davis? Tim Martin, founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon and a vocal supporter of the Leave campaign, made this observation earlier this month: ""Statements have been made by some senior PLC directors and trade organisations which are factually incorrect and highly misleading. ""Unsurprisingly, the misinformation has been adopted by many among the media, investors and the public as if it were true."" Yet even Mr Martin, who says Wetherspoon is ready for Brexit, admits costs have been ""significantly higher"" than last year, with further increases expected in labour, business rates, utilities and sugar taxes. Others warning recently on tough trading conditions include Marston's, the pub operator and brewer of beers including Pedigree, Hobgoblin and Thwaite's Lancaster Bomber, which warned last month of ""subdued market conditions"". And Greene King, Britain's biggest remaining combined brewer and pub operator, warned in September that it expected ""the challenges of weaker consumer confidence, increased costs and increasing competition to persist over the near term"". The message is clear: Britain's pubs are having a tough time of it. And the relief offered by the Chancellor this week, offering a Â£1,000 discount on business rates for pubs with a rateable value of under Â£100,000, may not be enough to stop that pub closure rate accelerating again."

More than 500 of those were made across Christmas Eve and Christmas Day alone. Shelter CEO Polly Neate told Sky News a ""crippling combination"" of reasons is behind the rise. ""The factors at the moment are firstly just the dire lack of affordable housing, and by affordable I mean affordable to rent for people on low incomes,"" she said. ""The second thing is the cuts to housing benefit, and that is meaning there's no help now for people who simply can't afford to pay their rent."" The charity also blames problems with the Government's new benefit system Universal Credit for creating delays which lead to people getting into rent arrears. Figures show calls to Shelter's helpline increased by 25% over the past year. The Government announced new housing measures in last week's Budget in a bid to tackle the issue, including changes to stamp duty and the building of more homes. Peter - not his real name - was placed into emergency accommodation in London in 2014 after struggling to afford private rental costs in the capital. Nearly four years on Peter, his wife and two children under five remain in the studio apartment. He told Sky News it's a difficult time in the run up to Christmas. ""For me it's been really hard, I've always said it's easier for me to suffer some hardship than them [his family]. For a long time we've been watching our budgets - there was no TV, microwave, toaster etc. ""Most of the time we are all four sharing the same bed so that places pressure on us as a family and also on my relationship with my wife."" Figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government show 4,134 people slept rough in England in 2016, a 16% increase on the previous year and a sixth consecutive yearly rise. But the charity Crisis says the number is actually more than double at 9,100 - and warns of the so-called ""hidden homeless"" including more than 68,000 sofa-surfing and thousands living in insecure or inadequate accommodation."

The new allegations were broadcast on Saturday night on Iranian state TV, hours after she called supporters taking part in a march to thank them. It comes as the UK considers making a Â£400m payment to Iran, to clear an outstanding debt that Tehran says London owes. Iranian state TV, which showed what it claimed were various documents that amounted to proof, said: ""The BBC team in which Nazanin was a member designed, programmed and executed the Iran Project from 2007 for three years. ""According to this document, Nazanin had eight important duties in the fields of training and recruitment for the purpose of launching the BBC Persian service, espionage institutions and opposition cyber teams. ""Nazanin Zaghari cooperated with the BBC channel until 2010 but quit the BBC after the end of her project and joined a more serious project."" :: UK could settle Â£450m debt to free Iran mum Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 while about to return from a holiday visiting relatives in Iran with her toddler daughter Gabriella. It was her fifth visit in 22 months. The charges at her trial were kept secret but she has been accused of acting to undermine the regime in Tehran. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was blamed for putting her at risk of a longer sentence by saying she was in Iran to train journalists - something her family staunchly denies. :: Richard Ratcliffe: My fight to free Nazanin from jail in Iran Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe has called on Mr Johnson to do more to win her release and to take him to Iran so he can see the wife and daughter he has been unable to see for the last 19 months. The latest TV report was accompanied by images, which the station claimed was documentary evidence, of a BBC redundancy letter from 2010, a BBC payslip from 2010, a university letter from 2007, a 2010 email to a contact from Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe saying she worked for the BBC World Service Trust training journalists and a 2009 letter to the British Embassy in Iran saying she is a training assistant with the BBC World Service Trust. It has been widely reported that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe joined the Thomson Reuters Foundation in 2010 after leaving BBC Media Action, the corporation's international development charity, which was previously called the BBC World Service Trust. :: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: A timeline The BBC's Persian TV service, which was initially funded by the Foreign Office, launched in 2009. It is said to be independent from government and is now funded by the BBC World Service from the licence fee The service, which is widely watched via satellite in Iran and beyond, fell foul of the Iranian authorities after it reported on protests against the regime in late 2009. The BBC and several other major western news organisations have reported that BBC Persian service and other foreign-based Iranian journalists and their families have been subjected to persecution by the Iranian regime. :: Iranian News Channel Press TV Loses Licence Mr Ratcliffe reacted to the Iranian state TV report by saying it was designed to increase pressure on the British government. London has said it may repay Tehran hundreds of millions of pounds it owes from a pre-1979 arms deal that did not go through, which has prompted critics to accuse the Government of paying a ransom - something the UK government refuses to do. Both sides say any payment would not be related to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case, even though a similar payment by America came as Iran released four US citizens in 2016. On Saturday, Sky News witnessed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe speaking by phone to her supporters from her jail at a rally in Hampstead, north London, at which she said she about her potential release: ""I can't wait for that day""."

2017-11-26,Artisan cider producers are concerned that a new levy could have a devastating impact on the industry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171127090409/https://news.sky.com/story/artisan-cider-makers-fear-new-binge-drinking-levy-11144607,"The legislation, to be brought in from February, would see a duty introduced on ciders with an alcohol content of between 6.9% and 7.5%. It was announced in the Budget and is aimed at cracking down on binge drinking. The target is white cider - paler in colour, cheap, with a high alcohol content, and often associated with street and underage binge drinking. But some traditional cider makers, who have been in the industry for decades, insist they will also be affected. Barny Butterfield runs Sandford Orchards in Devon, the oldest working cider shed in the country. He believes the levy could push prices up on some traditional ciders. Mr Butterfield told Sky News: ""As always when the government tries to intervene in small and fragile markets, which cider certainly is, they have changed the rules as to how alcohol is allowed to be made and that may affect a lot of growers, who make full strength ciders... I worry that there is now a law of unintended consequences."" Introducing the duty, Philip Hammond said he wanted to tackle ""excessive consumption by the most vulnerable people"". Alcohol Concern has, in the past, said super strength cider is becoming like heroine among alcoholics and many campaigners and homeless charities have called for it not to be sold in anything bigger than a litre bottle. MP Fiona Bruce is among those who welcome the duty. She said: ""Most of the craft cider industry won't be affected. ""What we are hoping is that producers will look at reformulating the alcohol content in cider and just reduce it enough to come under the alcohol duty band. ""That will encourage people to drink cider at a lower alcohol content, which is what also happened with beer."" But producers like Mr Butterworth don't believe the levy will have any effect, insisting it has only been introduced to make the Government look good. He says cheaper cider contains more sugar and less juice, and a tax would therefore mean that even more inexpensive ingredients, such as syrup, are used to increase profit margins. The Government insists the levy will only affect around 11.5% of the market. And of that, 78% is white cider. It also insists that most artisan producers make less than 70 hectolitres of cider a year, and will therefore be exempt from the duty. For the majority of drinkers the Budget was positive news in that most alcohol won't cost a penny more. But many cider producers are warning that if a new tax is introduced next year it could have a devastating impact on them, even putting them out of business."
2017-11-26,"Drone technology is constantly improving, making the machines better, cheaper and more desirable.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171127090409/https://news.sky.com/story/drone-owners-warned-as-new-laws-are-prepared-11144508,"This Christmas more drones than ever are expected to be sold to thousands of people who will fly them without any training at all. But that may be about to change, with the Government announcing the introduction of a draft drone bill, to be published next spring. The proposed bill will mean drone pilots will have register and sit safety awareness tests as part of plans to regulate their use. The new measures will also give police the right to ground drones or to seize drone parts to prove the device has been used to commit a crime. National Police Chiefs' Council lead for criminal misuse of drones, Assistant Chief Constable Serena Kennedy, said: ""Police forces are aware of the ever increasing use of drones by members of the public and we are working with all relevant partners to understand the threats that this new technology can pose when used irresponsibly or illegally. ""Do not take this lightly - if you use a drone to invade people's privacy or engage in disruptive behaviour, you could face serious criminal charges."" Banning drones from flying near airports or above 400ft could also form part of the new regulations. Currently, drones weighing more than 7kg can't be flown above 400ft, and they must always be in the pilot's line of sight. Most of the drone incidents reported by pilots are made at flight level - that's around 5,000 ft. But some have even been reported at up to 35,000ft. The danger can be seen in the increasing numbers of reports from pilots who say they have had a near-miss with a drone. In 2014 there were only six incidents but in 2015 that rose to 29. Last year there were 71 reports and in the first eight months of this year, there have already been 81. However, the Government does not want to ban drones completely. :: Gatwick drone near miss On Monday a scheme will be launched to support the research and development of drone technology for uses in industry, logistics and healthcare. Aviation minister Baroness Sugg said: ""Drones have great potential and we want to do everything possible to harness the benefits of this technology as it develops. ""But if we are to realise the full potential of this incredibly exciting technology, we have to take steps to stop illegal use of these devices and address safety and privacy concerns. ""These new laws strike a balance, to allow the vast majority of drone users to continue flying safely and responsibly, while also paving the way for drone technology to revolutionise businesses and public services."" The draft drone bill will be published for consultation and introduce secondary legislation amendments in spring 2018."

The prevalence of gender-based violence, across all countries and in all cultures, has sparked a new campaign by the UN Women called Draw A Line. During the next 16 days, UN Women and partners will light up iconic buildings in orange, to symbolise a brighter future without violence. In central London, campaigners encircled Covent Garden market with a bright orange vinyl tape; a physical line that stopped passers-by in their tracks. Messages were printed on it revealing the scale of violence, such as the fact that, on average, every week two women in the UK are killed by their partners. Laura Haynes, UN Women's UK Chair told Sky News, said: ""There has been a lot of talk about ending violence against women. ""What we've said is it's important to make a statement, it's important to be heard, but people are desperate now to take action, to find a way to make a difference. ""And so we said enough is enough, it's time to literally draw a line to end violence against women."" Too few women report being the victims of violence or abuse. A UN report revealed that a women is assaulted an average of 35 times before she reports it, and 85% of rapes are never reported at all. Phoebe Tansley, a women's rights campaigner, told Sky News: ""If you look at the rates of reporting and the rates of convictions for sexual and domestic violence in the UK, they are still shockingly low. ""There are issues there where our systems are not representing survivors properly and they are not giving them the access to justice and the support that they need."" There were marches and protests in a number of locations besides London, including France, Lebanon and Spain. The campaign ends on 10 December."

The seasonal sum is up from Â£19.82 last year. Brexit's weakening of the pound and inflation are being blamed for the rise. Caroline Bloor, consumer director at Good Housekeeping, which conducted the survey, said it was ""no surprise"" the Christmas grocery bill had rocketed given the pound's performance since the EU referendum. :: How the cost of 11 ingredients have changed since 2016 For those who do not have time to shop around, here are the cheapest supermarkets ranked by price for a one-stop Christmas dinner. :: Lidl - Â£25.53:: Aldi - Â£25.68:: Iceland - Â£28.12:: Tesco - Â£28.48:: Asda - Â£31.17:: Co-op - Â£33.48:: Morrisons - Â£36.23:: Sainsbury's - Â£36.59:: M&S - Â£38.43:: Waitrose - Â£41.47 Ms Bloor added: ""Bargains are thin on the ground this Christmas, so supermarket choice is crucial.

2017-11-28,It was the first time that I'd seen Harry and Meghan together. There was no way I'd expected them to appear somewhere as open and public as Nathan Phillips Square in the middle of Toronto.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171128191045/https://news.sky.com/story/getting-to-know-meghan-markle-how-love-flourished-with-prince-harry-11146377,"But on 25 September, around 14 months after they started dating, they walked straight past me at the Invictus Games. Holding hands, and without uttering a word, they were making a very clear statement to the world's media. This was the real thing. For a royal correspondent finding out about Meghan has been a joy. There's so much about her online and lots of it put out there by the actress herself. Playing the paralegal Rachel Zane, in the legal drama Suits, really boosted her profile, and like any ambitious starlet she worked hard to build her online ""brand"". Her own blog ""The Tig"" and her Instagram account gave her fans a very open window into Meghan's world. Her blog was closed down shortly after we found out she was dating Harry, but her Instagram is still a high-definition, filter- enhanced picture book of her life. You can find photos of her friends, her dogs, her family and the famous people she's rubbed shoulders with, from her co-stars on Suits, to Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama. It also gives you a fascinating insight into how this future royal views the world, with motivational quotes liberally scattered amongst the photographs. One that really stands out is: ""Teach your daughters to worry less about fitting into glass slippers and more about shattering glass ceilings"". Very telling when you consider the life that lies ahead of her. For all the posing and pouting at red carpet events, this is a woman of substance. A self-proclaimed activist and feminist, who was invited to be a UN advocate for women's political participation, she spoke at the United Nations on International Women's day in 2015, saying: ""We need a global understanding that we cannot implement change effectively without women's political participation."" Ahead of the US elections she made it clear she wouldn't be voting for Donald Trump, saying in an interview: ""As misogynistic as Trump is, and so vocal about it, that's a huge chunk of it. You're not just voting for a woman, if it's Hilary, because she's a woman, but certainly because Trump has made it easy to see that you don't really want that kind of world that he's painting"". It's exciting to see a punchy woman who hasn't been afraid to speak out on difficult subjects joining the House of Windsor. But it will be interesting to see how she mixes her compulsion for campaigning with her new responsibilities as a member of ""The Firm"". Don't forget that politics is off limits when you're a royal. Through her charity work with World Vision, Meghan has travelled to Rwanda for their clean water campaign. She also visited India to show how the potential of young girls is being compromised because of the stigma surrounding menstruation. The comparisons with Princess Diana will inevitably come thick and fast, especially from her homeland of America, where they still have an obsession with Harry's mother, 20 years after she died. One aspect of Meghan that has already attracted attention is her ethnicity. And it is a subject she hasn't shied away from as a proud bi-racial woman, brought up by an African-American mum and a white father. In an article for Elle magazine she described how her parents ""crafted a world around me to make me feel like I wasn't different, but special"". For Christmas her mum and dad bought her one black doll and one white doll. It's an upbringing that has encouraged her to speak out about racial equality. She is the first mixed-race person to be marrying into the British royal family. Commentators have described it as socially momentous for the country, and a good reason to get us talking about diversity and social mobility. It's also been suggested it is an opportunity for black people to feel more connected to the all-white palace lineage. It is a significant moment and another move towards modernity for a family that under the reign of Harry's grandmother has constantly adjusted and changed, to make sure the monarchy remains accessible and relevant. Harry and Meghan have got plenty in common. Just start with their humanitarian work; you'll find no shortage of pictures of them both dancing and hugging little children. Both are from divorced families, funnily enough they seem to share a love of dogs, and they are used to being in the spotlight. But their whirlwind romance has still taken the world by surprise; the Queen's grandson hooking up with an American divorcee, who's appeared in her underwear on TV. Her own high-profile career means that most of the skeletons are already well and truly out of the closet."

It came as Labour and the SNP suggested they would pursue an allegation against the Government that it was in ""contempt of Parliament"". The row focuses on Brexit Secretary David Davis' refusal to hand over all information collated on how 58 industrial sectors will be affected by leaving the EU. He has said anything commercially sensitive or that could damage the UK's negotiating position would not be released. But Brexit select committee chair Hilary Benn said the more than 850-page document he received was ""not in keeping"" with the binding motion passed earlier in November. But Mr Walker denied the claim during an urgent question on Tuesday, saying: ""We have not edited or redacted reports."" He later admitted: ""We have collated information in a way that doesn't include some material."" Veteran Tory backbencher Ken Clarke said the decision had risked ""reducing parliamentary sovereignty to a slightly ridiculous level"". Colleague Philip Hollobone said it was a ""mistake"" for the Tories not to amend Labour's original motion, warning the party was now on ""thin parliamentary ice"". Speaker John Bercow also warned Mr Davis should meet the Brexit select committee to explain the redactions. He said: ""Nothing - no commitment, no other diarised engagement - is more important than respecting the House, and in this case the committee of this House which has ownership of this matter and to which the papers were provided."""
2017-11-28,These are difficult times for the pub industry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171128191045/https://news.sky.com/story/beer-boss-balks-at-unprecedented-cost-pressures-in-pub-sector-11141528,"The rate of closures has slowed down, from 29 per week several years ago to 21 per week now, but trading remains tough. Pub prices remain high compared with cheap supermarket beer, while the competitive threat from supermarkets is exacerbated by the fact that food sold in pubs is subject to VAT, while food sold in supermarkets is not. Many regular drinkers, who were driven away from pubs by the smoking ban in 2007, still prefer to drink - and smoke - at home. Business rates, meanwhile, remain such a perennial bugbear that the Treasury has had to provide pubs with specific reliefs - renewed this week by the Chancellor in his Budget - to help dull the pain. Societal changes have also contributed, including a switch from beer to wine among many drinkers and a drop in popularity among younger consumers, with one in six people aged between 18-25 are reckoned to be teetotal. And now, with earnings growth again starting to lag inflation, disposable incomes are again under pressure. There is an additional factor in London. The Economist magazine recently published analysis showing that pub closures in the capital had been particularly marked, which it said was partly because London was over-saturated with pubs to begin with and also because of the growing concentration in some boroughs of Muslims, whose religion forbids them from drinking alcohol. Under those circumstances, today's half year results from Fuller, Smith & Turner, the Chiswick-based pub operator and brewer of beers such as London Pride, are pretty creditable. Half year sales rose by 6%, to Â£209.3m, while pre-tax profits on an underlying basis rose by 4% to Â£23.8m. Within that, sales and profits in Fuller's managed pub and hotel business, which now account for almost two-thirds of group profits, were up by 7% and 6% respectively. Sales in the brewing operation, whose other brands include Honeydew, Seafarers, ESB and Frontier Craft Lager, were up 5%, but operating profits fell by 13%, which the company blamed on increasing marketing spending and a pincer attack from rivals. At one end of the market, the global mega-brewers have been cutting prices aggressively, while at the other, independent craft brewers have been benefiting from lower levels of beer duty than their larger rivals. So Fullers has been caught in the middle. Yet the pressure is still there. Simon Emeny, the chief executive, pointed out today: ""The last six months have seen some unprecedented influences on the business, not only in our particular industry, but in the context of the wider UK economy and global political scene. ""I cannot remember a time when we have faced such an array of additional cost pressures, particularly in our managed pubs, starting with the 26% rise in business rates. The pub sector is now responsible for 2.8% of the total business rates bill, despite only generating just 0.5% of total turnover. ""Over and above this increase, we have met with rises in the Apprenticeship Levy and Living Wage rates."" Fuller's is not the only pub operator warning of tough conditions. On Thursday, Mitchells & Butlers - owner of the Miller & Carter, Toby Carvery, All Bar One, O'Neill's and Harvester chains - announced it would not be paying a half-year dividend next year, flagging higher costs as a result of the drop in the pound, while also warning that it could face staffing shortages depending on changes to immigration and employment laws as Britain leaves the EU. There was this warning, too, from the pub operator Youngs last week: ""The political environment remains predictable and this ongoing uncertainty is unhelpful when it comes to the strength of the broader economy."" It, too, flagged concerns over Brexit. But are pub customers really being deterred from popping to their local due to fears that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, may be putting one over on David Davis? Tim Martin, founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon and a vocal supporter of the Leave campaign, made this observation earlier this month: ""Statements have been made by some senior PLC directors and trade organisations which are factually incorrect and highly misleading. ""Unsurprisingly, the misinformation has been adopted by many among the media, investors and the public as if it were true."" Yet even Mr Martin, who says Wetherspoon is ready for Brexit, admits costs have been ""significantly higher"" than last year, with further increases expected in labour, business rates, utilities and sugar taxes. Others warning recently on tough trading conditions include Marston's, the pub operator and brewer of beers including Pedigree, Hobgoblin and Thwaite's Lancaster Bomber, which warned last month of ""subdued market conditions"". And Greene King, Britain's biggest remaining combined brewer and pub operator, warned in September that it expected ""the challenges of weaker consumer confidence, increased costs and increasing competition to persist over the near term"". The message is clear: Britain's pubs are having a tough time of it. And the relief offered by the Chancellor this week, offering a Â£1,000 discount on business rates for pubs with a rateable value of under Â£100,000, may not be enough to stop that pub closure rate accelerating again."
2017-11-28,Men over the age of 18 will be able to buy Viagra over the counter without a prescription after a reclassification.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171128191045/https://news.sky.com/story/viagra-to-be-sold-over-the-counter-for-the-first-time-after-reclassification-11147842,"Health officials announced they were reclassifying Viagra Connect tablets following a public consultation. The decision by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) means men will be able to buy the tablets containing sildenafil 50mg from their pharmacist if they have erectile dysfunction. The thinking behind the reclassification is for the drug to be available to men who may not have previously sought help. :: Seizures soar as erectile dysfunction drugs used as party pills The MHRA said pharmacists would be able to determine if the blue pill was appropriate for the patient and could give advice on erectile dysfunction. They could also warn them of potential side effects, advise on how to use the pills and assess whether the patient needs to visit their GP. However, men with severe heart problem, those at risk of heart conditions, those with liver failure or those taking ""interacting medicines"" would still need a prescription. The authority also hopes to steer people away from buying the drug illegally. Mick Foy, MHRA's group manager in vigilance and risk management of medicines, said the move was ""good news for men's health"". :: Viagra maker Pfizer cites poor performance for stock de-listing He said: ""The move to make Viagra Connect more widely accessible will encourage men to seek help within the healthcare system and increase awareness of erectile dysfunction. ""Erectile dysfunction can be a debilitating condition, so it's important men feel they have fast access to quality and legitimate care, and do not feel they need to turn to counterfeit online supplies which could have potentially serious side effects."" Drug manufacturer Pfizer is preparing for the launch of Viagra Connect in the spring. Medical director Dr Berkeley Phillips said: ""We understand some men may avoid seeking support and treatment for this condition, so we believe giving them the option to talk to a pharmacist and buy Viagra Connect could be a real step forward in encouraging more men into the healthcare system."""
2017-11-28,"John Profumo, the Tory minister forced to quit during a sex scandal in the 1960s, had a long-running relationship with a glamorous Nazi spy, records suggest.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171128191045/https://news.sky.com/story/profumo-had-long-relationship-with-glamorous-nazi-spy-11147296,"Newly-declassified papers show evidence of a long relationship with German-born fashion model Gisela Winegard. The two met at Oxford in the early 1930s before she worked for German intelligence in Paris during the Second World War, according to MI5 files published on Tuesday. In 1963, at the height of the Profumo Affair, an MI6 officer wrote a letter to the MI5 and pointed out a previous intelligence report, dating to October 1950, which made ""mention of an association between Gisela Klein and Profumo. The relationship was believed to have begun at around 1933 and ""had apparently not ceased"" at the time of the 1950 report. The 1963 letter mentioned a rejected 1951 UK visa application by Mrs Winegard, whose maiden name was Klein. Authorities thought she had ""recently engaged in blackmail activities"", the letter says. The papers do not say who they tried to blackmail but the visa application for a six-week ""pleasure visit"" listed Mr Profumo as a reference. The records show that Mrs Winegard had been ""on intimate terms with the German Military Attache in Paris"" in 1938, leading the Home Office to say she be barred from Britain. She ran a secret information service for the Nazis in Paris during the war and was said to have been the mistress of a high-ranking German officer, with whom she had a child. After Paris was liberated by the Allies in 1944 she was jailed for espionage, her jailer being Mr Winegard - the two were married after he got her released. She also caught the attention of the US Secret Service after the war when she was accused of harbouring a fugitive German spy chief while living in France. Mr Profumo had told MI5 about her, admitting he had met her in 1936 and describing her as ""always hard up"". ""Later she went on to become a mannequin (model) and made a large number of useful contacts. ""Lady Astor is alleged to have expressed the opinion that she was a spy."" Mr Profumo was MP for Kettering from 1940 to 1945, and for Stratford-upon-Avon from 1950. He was a British Army officer in World War Two and married actress Valerie Hobson in 1954. While Secretary of State for War in 1963, he was implicated in the scandal that was to be his downfall: claims he had shared a mistress - Christine Keeler - with a Soviet defence attache. He initially denied this but later resigned in disgrace. Having left politics, he concentrated on charity work until his death in 2006, aged 91."

The Â£173m programme was launched David Cameron in 2011 during his second year as prime minister, and allows 18 to 25-year-olds to volunteer in poor communities in 21 countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Those aged 25 to 35 can take up leadership roles on the various projects. The NAO report said the Department for International Development (DfID) sees ICS as a ""high-risk programme due to the security and safety issues"" involved in placing volunteers in developing countries. Petty and violent crime, endemic diseases, political instability and natural disasters are all concerns. The report said: ""Since phase two of the programme started, 3.75% of participants have been involved in incidents, including 0.24% who were involved in critical incidents and 0.07% in crisis incidents. ""ICS safeguarding incidents have included death by drowning of two volunteers, sexual assaults, and the detention of volunteers by local police."" Since its launch, more than 30,000 young people have volunteered across the world, with the number of British participants being matched by youngsters from the country they are in. Phase one, which ran from April 2012 to August 2015, provided placements for 7,000 UK volunteers - while phase two, which runs until February 2019, has the aim of providing 10,000 placements for UK volunteers. The Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), which runs the programme, has taken action against charities and organisations which provide volunteering opportunities over safety concerns. ""Volunteers have experienced a variety of incidents in 2015 and 2016. VSO served notice under the provisions of its contract with one consortium member and paused the contract of another following security and safeguarding concerns,"" the report said. In 2013, the programme faced widespread criticism after a government study into the programme found each volunteer was costing the tax-payer Â£7,633 for their three-month stint abroad. A review in March this year found the VSO had made progress in terms of safety, security and safeguarding policies. However, it had missed diversity targets and had ""not consistently delivered development impact"". A DfID spokesperson said: ""The NAO rightly highlights that the International Citizen Service programme provides a life-changing opportunity for young people to help the world's poorest, fly the flag for Global Britain overseas and build their own skills, confidence and job prospects. ""The safety and wellbeing of all ICS volunteers is our first priority and this report acknowledges the actions we have taken. ""There are constant assessments and review of ICS programmes and we will not hesitate to stop working with partners that cannot meet our security standards."""

It raked in Â£214.3m, with both stores and online sales driving the increase. John Lewis said it saw a peak of 705 items per minute sold online during Black Friday itself. The John Lewis Partnership, which is employee-owned and also includes Waitrose, is looking for a stronger performance across the festive season to end the year on a high. It had previously warned of tougher trading when it reported a 53% plunge in half-year profits despite rising sales. Weak wage growth has combined with price rises in the economy to squeeze household budgets. It has left all retailers under pressure to absorb price increases linked to the collapse in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote - rather than pass them on to customers at the check-out. Analysts will be looking at the trading profitability of retailers, rather than sales growth, following the Christmas season amid mixed forecasts for spending. A recent report by Visa predicted the first fall in four years. But the update from John Lewis will have provided some encouragement for the sector as many big name retailers continue to seek bargain hunters in an extended Cyber Monday sale. John Lewis said Apple MacBooks and LG Smart TVs were some of its best sellers on Black Friday. A report by VoucherCodes and the Centre for Retail Research expected UK consumers to spend Â£7.8bn over the four-day period - up 7% on last year."

The 52-year-old pleaded guilty to one count of assault by beating and was sentenced on Tuesday at Westminster Magistrates' Court following the incident, which took place after the couple attended a charity event. Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot branded the defendant a ""nasty drunk"" and added: ""You were making your way by taxi. ""Both had been drinking and the taxi driver listened as you argued. Your wife accused you of taking drugs and leaving her alone for most of the evening. ""You called her a nothing and [a] whore.""

He was also ordered to pay a Â£170 victim surcharge and Â£85 towards court costs. At a previous hearing, prosecutor Kate Shilton said taxi driver Daniel Shepherd described what Goldsmith threw at his wife as a ""left hook"". It was said to have knocked her out for about 15 seconds. Mrs Goldsmith said she was now suffering from panic attacks in a victim impact statement. Jane Humphryes QC, defending, said both parties were intoxicated and that alcohol may have had more of an effect on Goldsmith as he was on a ""charity diet"", with limited food and no alcohol. Goldsmith said he lashed out in a ""spontaneous"" reaction to being struck after Mrs Goldsmith was seen by the taxi driver ""slapping her husband to the face"". Ms Humphryes suggested Goldsmith may have avoided court and been given a caution if he had not been related to royalty. She said: ""Had it not been for his high profile, it would have been dealt with in that way. ""Had he been almost any other person in that police station out after a charity event, this never would have come, not just to the attention of the Crown Prosecution Service, but in this case, to the courts and to the media."" Goldsmith indicated he remained ""devoted"" to his wife who he loved ""very much"" and hoped to patch things up through joint counselling."
2017-11-28,Eight decomposed bodies have washed up on a Japanese beach in a small wooden ship - raising speculation they could have come from North Korea.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171128191045/https://news.sky.com/story/ghost-ship-of-decomposed-bodies-washed-ashore-in-sea-of-japan-11146745,"The vessel was found by the Japan Coast Guard on Monday, just days after two similarly skeletal male bodies were found on the same western shore of Sado - an island in the Sea of Japan. Local police and the coast guard believe the two bodies found over the weekend may have been from North Korea, which is 450 miles from the shore, with what appeared to be cigarettes from the country and life jackets with Korean lettering found nearby. The officials are working to confirm where they - and the eight found on Monday - came from. Last week, eight fishermen who claimed to be from North Korea were found 44 miles south of Monday's discovery, with their boat appearing to have run into trouble during what is a season of hostile weather. Professor Yoshihiko Yamada, from Japan's Tokai University, said: ""During the summer, the Sea of Japan is quite calm. But it starts to get choppy when November comes. It gets dangerous when northwesterly winds start to blow."" Other experts have said the recent accidents could be down to food shortages in North Korea, with smaller and older ships forced to sail beyond its coastal waters. Seo Yu-suk, research manager of North Korean Studies Institution in Seoul, said the rogue state - subject to greater sanctions from the United States after President Donald Trump designated it a state sponsor of terrorism - was pushing ""so hard"" for its people to gather more fish to make up for the shortage. Forty-four wooden ships believed to be from the Korean peninsula have washed up on Japanese shores - or drifted off the country's coast - so far this year, compared to 66 in the whole of 2016. The crew is often already dead when they wash ashore, a phenomenon leading them to be referred to in the local media as ""ghost ships""."

The dual British-Iranian national, from Hampstead, north London, was also thought to be at risk of cancer after lumps were found in her breasts, but she has since been given the all-clear. The Free Nazanin Campaign confirmed the Iranian Prosecutors Office ordered Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe to be assessed by the Health Commission. She has instructed her lawyer to challenge the legality of Iranian news broadcasts about her case which campaigners say impacts ""both on her chances of a fair trial and her health"". In August, her husband Richard Ratcliffe said she was in a ""fragile state"" and a psychiatrist who had seen her diagnosed advanced depression. :: Richard Ratcliffe: My fight to free Nazanin from jail in Iran On Saturday night, Iranian state TV broadcast a series of fresh claims against her which it claimed proved she had been working to undermine the Islamic Republic. They included BBC pay slips, emails from Nazanin about her then-work for the BBC World Service Trust and letter to the British embassy, all dating from before 2010. Nazanin was arrested in April 2016 as she was about to board a flight home to the UK with her daughter after spending time on holiday visiting her family. :: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: A timeline She had previously visited Iran four times with her daughter, who was 22 months old when Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained.

In one she is pictured holding a Paddington Bear toy that was given to her when she was visited by Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt in August. The BBC has released a statement clarifying that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has never worked for BBC Persian TV nor trained Iranian journalists, as the news broadcasts alleged. :: UK could settle Â£450m debt to free Iran mum On Saturday, Sky News filmed as her supporters who had gathered for a rally were able to talk to the mother as she called from her jail in Tehran. Mr Ratcliffe says he has able to speak to his wife about twice a week and she sees her daughter roughly as often."
2017-11-28,"The UK's seven biggest lenders are all strong enough to cope with a ""disorderly"" no-deal Brexit, according to a Bank of England assessment.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171128191045/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-banks-strong-enough-to-cope-with-disorderly-brexit-bank-of-england-says-11147340,"But the Bank said it would consider whether the firms need to make sure they hold billions more capital as an emergency buffer in case such a scenario coincides with a wider global downturn. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee also set out a wishlist of actions it says should be taken to try to mitigate the risks to UK financial services posed by the departure from the EU. For the first time since the annual stress testing regime began in 2014, all the major lenders received a clean bill of health though the weakest two - Barclays and state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland - struggled. The tests modelled a nightmare scenario under which UK GDP slumps by 4.7% amid a wider global downturn, unemployment rises to 9.5%, the pound plunges and the Bank's interest rate climbs to 4% - while house prices undergo a record 33% collapse. They were carried out on Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander UK, Standard Chartered and Nationwide. The tests work out how much the level of capital held by each lender would fall under the ""stress"". The Bank of England said the latest invented scenario would mean banks incurring losses of Â£50bn over two years - a level that would, a decade ago, have wiped out their capital base. Since then lenders have been building up their strength amid tougher standards. In the latest assessment the Bank found that, based on their state at the end of 2016, Barclays and RBS would fall short of the required levels set for them. However, asset sales they have carried out in the months since that time meant they would now meet targets. The stress testing regime was put in place in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to try to ensure that, should another sharp downturn occur, lending would not seize up, accentuating the difficulties faced by the wider economy. The latest scenario included potential risks to the financial sector such as those posed by the growth in consumer debt as well as global vulnerabilities from countries such as China. The latest stress test was published alongside the FPC's biannual Financial Stability Report. The FPC confirmed that it was raising the so-called ""countercyclical buffer"" - a back stop that can be held by lenders so that it can be released at a time of economic stress - from 0.5% to 1%, continuing a normalisation after it was cut to zero following the Brexit vote. That 1% level establishes an emergency buffer for the UK financial system of Â£11.4bn. But the FPC acknowledged that in the first half of next year it would need to consider lifting this ""in the light of the overall risk environment"". ""The FPC judges the UK banking system could continue to support the real economy through a disorderly Brexit,"" it said. ""However, the combination of a disorderly Brexit and a severe global recession and stressed misconduct costs could result in more severe conditions than in the stress test. ""In such circumstances, capital buffers would need to be drawn down substantially more than in the stress test and, as a result, banks would be more likely to restrict lending to the real economy."" The Bank also called for a series of measures to try to mitigate the ""risks of disruption to UK financial services arising from Brexit"". These included ensuring that the right UK legal and regulatory framework was in place, and delivering a ""timely agreement"" for a transition period - echoing calls previously made by Bank officials and the City though not giving a timeframe. It also said legislation in both the UK and EU was needed to protect cross-border insurance policies affecting six million UK policy holders and 30 million in the EU, as well as Â£26tn of derivatives contracts, that could otherwise be affected. Meanwhile, the Bank will set out plans by the end of this year on licencing European banks to continue operating in the UK after Brexit."

They did not know about each other before Harry had never heard of Suits - the TV drama in which Meghan stars - and she said she did not grow up reading stories about the prince, so learned everything about the Royal from himself. 2. An unnamed mutual friend introduced them Only revealed as a woman, the friend set them up on a blind date. They went on another date the next day before Harry persuaded Meghan to join him in Botswana the following month for five days, where they slept under the stars. 3. She would not let him finish proposing The prince got down on one knee - and before he could finish, Meghan asked: ""Can I say yes now?"" They hugged and Harry had to ask if he could give her the ring, which includes a large diamond from Botswana and two smaller diamonds from jewellery belonging to his late mother, Diana. :: Meghan Markle: It was an immediate 'yes' to Prince Harry proposal 4. They love cooking together Harry proposed to Meghan as they were ""trying to roast a chicken"". He also revealed they cook dinner a lot and got to know each other by staying in rather than going out for dinner. 5. The couple want to have children soon Prince Harry said they want to take it one step at a time but ""hopefully we'll start a family in the near future"". 6. Meghan has met the Queen They have met a ""couple of times"", with Meghan describing Harry's grandmother as ""an incredible woman"". She said she appreciated meeting the Queen ""through his lens"" as he has so much respect for her as a monarch but also loves her as his grandmother. Prince Harry said his grandparents have been ""wonderful"" and have known about their relationship ""for quite some time"". 7. The Queen's corgis took to Meghan straight away Harry said he has spent the last 33 years being barked at by his grandmother's beloved dogs, but they have been better behaved around his fiancee. Meghan said the dogs lay on her feet during tea, wagging their tails. :: Prince Harry's 'romantic' proposal to Meghan Markle 8. Meghan wants to use her newfound platform for good The American confirmed she will not be continuing as an actress but wants to initially focus on smaller organisations who are working on the same causes she has ""always been passionate about"". 9. Harry thinks Meghan will become a singer When asked what Meghan will do with having a bigger platform and voice, Prince Harry joked: ""Sing."" Meghan laughed the suggestion off, saying she is not a singer. 10. The pair want to spend most of their time in Commonwealth countries Prince Harry said there is a ""hell of a lot of staff and work that needs doing"" and ""with lots of young people running around the Commonwealth that's where we're going to spend most of our time hopefully"". 11. Meghan and Diana would have been ""thick as thieves"" Prince Harry said his mother would ""be over the moon, jumping up and down"" at news of their engagement - and that he believes Diana and his fiancee would have been ""best friends"" and ""thick as thieves"". ""It is days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But you know with the ring and with everything else that's going on I'm sure she's... with us."" 12. Kate has been ""wonderful"" to Meghan Harry said he did not tell anybody about Meghan for a while - but when he did, William and Kate were ""longing"" to meet her. They regularly meet up as they are neighbours in Kensington Palace. Meghan said Kate has ""been wonderful"" and Prince Harry said his brother has been ""amazing"", as has Prince Charles. 13. Meghan will become part of the Royal ""team"" Prince Harry said welcoming Meghan into his family means ""another team player as part of the bigger team"". He said they want to encourage ""the younger generation to be able to see the world in the correct sense rather than perhaps having a distorted view""."

It traded at $10,009 on the CEX exchange on Tuesday morning before dropping back down. Over this calendar year, the digital cash has increased 1,000% in value and is continuing to attract investors. Despite concerns that a bubble in the cryptocurrency's value has been driven by increasing investment from those who fear they are missing out, investors continue to buy in to the digital means of exchange. Bitcoin has surged through a number of symbolic milestones in recent weeks, showing an exponential curve on value-tracking charts. However, as the World Coin Index image chart below shows, the volume of Bitcoin transactions has not grown at a similar pace to Bitcoin's value - suggesting that many of those buying it are speculating on its value rather than using the currency to buy goods. Despite volatility prompting severe drops at times, it has gained serious interest from financial institutions, with CME Group announcing its plans to launch a futures market in Bitcoin by the end of the year. Onlookers have suggested that CME's entry into Bitcoin could lure in more cautious investors. CME Group's contracts will be settled in cash, meaning that investors would not receive Bitcoin at a lower (or higher) rate, but the difference in price in dollars. Sebastian Purcell, an assistant professor at SUNY Cortland in New York, wrote that he believed CME's futures market would boost Bitcoin's price - but ultimately ""spells the end of Bitcoin mania"". In a market outlook piece written for Seeking Alpha, Mr Purcell said: ""These capital flows from institutions will temper volatility. This will make Bitcoin undesirable for traders, since volatility is critical for a good trading vehicle. ""These points mean that the gold-rush is over, but perhaps they also mean that Bitcoin could finally serve as a digital currency."""
2017-11-28,The Government is being urged to consider introducing legal drug consumption rooms in a bid to reduce the number of drug-related deaths.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171128191045/https://news.sky.com/story/call-for-legal-drug-taking-rooms-which-can-reduce-deaths-11147235,"Drug-related deaths and litter have reached an all time high in the UK, with 3,744 deaths last year, according to a new report commissioned by the Drug, Alcohol and Justice Cross Party Parliamentary Group. The report recommended a trial of drug consumption rooms to provide a safe, clean and legal space for users. Lizzie McCullogh from drug policy think-tank Volteface, which wrote the report, told Sky News such a facility can legally work in the UK. She said: ""We know the evidence shows that drug consumption rooms can reduce drug-related deaths and drug-related litter and we know that both drug-related deaths and drug-related litter are on the rise. ""Now we have to turn to feasibility and what our report shows is that drug consumption rooms can be introduced in the UK and there are viable policy options."" According to Volteface, there is a growing number of drug litter hotspots in the UK - areas of infected needles and syringes left by users in public areas such as parks and subways. Needlestick injuries can lead to the transfer of infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis C. Figures obtained by Volteface show Belfast saw a 1474% rise in call-outs for the removal of drug-related litter between 2013/14 and 2016/17. Liverpool, Sheffield, Cardiff, Doncaster and Leeds also saw substantial increases. The idea of drug consumption rooms is being welcomed by former users. Carl Price used Class A drugs for nearly two decades and spent four years sleeping rough on the streets of Birmingham. He has been clean for two years and now works to help those still using. He told Sky News a safe place to take drugs would be a massive help for addicts, saying: ""They're going to do it (take drugs) anyway. ""Maybe they'll do it out on the streets in car parks or in blocks of flats, so to have somewhere safe gives us a chance to have some form of interaction with them."" The idea is already being considered in Dublin and Glasgow. Dr Saket Priyadarshi, associate medical director for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: ""The current situation is that people inject in alleys and back lanes and they inject in a rushed manner and in a high-risk manner. ""When there are consequences of that drug use there are no supports around there to manage things such as an overdose."" Despite this, the Government rejects the idea of consumption rooms and told Sky News it has no plans to introduce them. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The UK's approach on drugs remains clear - we must prevent drug use in our communities and support people dependent on drugs through treatment and recovery. ""We have no plans to introduce drug consumption rooms. ""A range of offences is likely to be committed in the operation of drug consumption rooms. ""It is for local police forces to enforce the law in such circumstances and, as with other offences of this type, we would expect them to do so."""

Thursday is tipped to be the coldest day of the week. Met Office meteorologist Martin Bowles said: ""All this week there's going to be showers down the eastern side of the country, even today and tomorrow we're likely to get some snow on higher ground, places like the North Yorkshire moors. ""And because Thursday is that much colder, there's potential for snow a bit further south, places in East Anglia, Lincolnshire and perhaps some snow reaching city levels, such as Newcastle and Durham."" Councillor Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said councils are prepared for the lower temperatures. He said: ""Councils are constantly monitoring the weather, with up-to-the-minute reports to stay one step ahead. ""Depots are filled with 1.5 million tonnes of salt and gritters are ready to be deployed at a moment's notice to make sure our local roads are clear and open to our residents where possible."" Public Health England (PHE) has issued a cold weather alert and health warning. Dr Thomas Waite, of PHE's Extreme Events team, said: ""As the weather is going to get colder everywhere in the coming days, this is a really good time to check on those who may be at risk. ""People with diseases such as heart and lung conditions, older people, and young children can feel the ill-effects of cold weather more than the rest of us."" People should wear lots of thin layers instead of just a few thick items, and to keep their home heated to at least 18C. South Western Railway warned commuters the colder weather could affect journeys. ""Ice can cause problems for trains as it can prevent trains from drawing power from the electrified rail,"" said a statement on its website. ""Network Rail-run special vehicles treat our tracks to reduce the effects of the poor weather conditions and will be taking appropriate action over the next few days."""
2017-11-28,"Social mobility is a postcode lottery in the UK with London ""looking like a different country from the rest of Britain"", a report has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171128191045/https://news.sky.com/story/social-mobility-in-uk-a-postcode-lottery-report-finds-11147331,"The Social Mobility Commission says success is often tied to geography - with West Somerset the worst place in Britain for disadvantaged children and Westminster the best area for young people to progress. The commission's State of the Nation report states that London and its surrounding areas are pulling away from the rest of the country, while many rural, coastal and former industrial areas are being left behind economically and hollowed out socially. The report debunks the assumption that a simple north/south divide exists. Instead, it suggests there are hotspots and coldspots found in almost every part of the country. London dominates the hotspots, while the East and West Midlands are the worst performing regions. Youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds who live there face lower rates of pay, fewer top jobs and travel-to-work times nearly four times those of urban residents. :: Cross-party campaign to fight PM's grammar schools plan The report calls on the Government to increase its spending on those parts of the country that most need it. Estimates suggest that the North is Â£6bn a year underfunded compared to London. The report ranks all 324 local authorities in England in terms of their social mobility prospects for someone from a disadvantaged background. It uses a range of 16 indicators for every major life stage to map the nation's social mobility hotspots and coldspots. A similar, but not comparable, approach is taken for Scotland and Wales. While more affluent areas tend to outperform deprived areas in the index, a number of places buck the trend. Some of the most deprived areas in England are hotspots, including most London boroughs - such as Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham. Conversely, some affluent areas - such as West Berkshire, Cotswold and Crawley - are among the worst for offering good education, employment opportunities and affordable housing to their most disadvantaged residents. :: Britain's towns and cities 'hollowed-out' by social divide Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn, chair of the Social Mobility Commission, said the UK ""seems to be in the grip of a self-reinforcing spiral of ever-growing division"". ""That takes a spatial form, not just a social one,"" he said. ""There is a stark social mobility lottery in Britain today. ""London and its hinterland are increasingly looking like a different country from the rest of Britain. It is moving ahead, as are many of our country's great cities. But too many rural and coastal areas and the towns of Britain's old industrial heartlands are being left behind economically and hollowed out socially."" He added: ""A new level of effort is needed to tackle the phenomenon of left-behind Britain. ""Overcoming the divisions that exist in Britain requires far more ambition and far bigger scale. A less divided Britain will require a more redistributive approach to spreading education, employment and housing prospects across our country."""

Yvonne MacHugh, partner of one of the men - Billy Irving, said they had been taken to the British embassy after being released on Tuesday. ""They will just go to a hotel in Chennai and will be able to sleep in a bed and have a proper shower for the first time in about two years,"" said Ms MacHugh. She said Mr Irving had already called her and could not believe he had finally been released. ""He's just over the moon and didn't think they would be released,"" said Ms MacHugh. ""He took everything that was said with a pinch of salt and didn't believe it. ""We are hoping they could be home in two weeks. If it's less than that it will be a miracle."" The men were jailed in October 2013 while working as security guards on a ship in the Indian Ocean. Indian authorities were said to have found 35 guns and almost 6000 rounds of ammunition, which they claimed had not been properly declared. But after a four-year legal battle, the men - who have consistently denied the charges - were eventually found not guilty by India's Appeal Court. The detained men were Nick Dunn, 31, Billy Irving, 37, John Armstrong, 30, Nicholas Simpson, 47, Ray Tindall, 42, and Paul Towers, 54. They were among 35 men arrested while working aboard the MV Seaman Guard Ohio, a vessel owned by an American company offering armed protection against piracy to ships travelling between the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. All those imprisoned - who also came from Ukraine, Estonia and India - were acquitted. The charges were at first overturned when the men showed papers for the weapons had been issued by the British government and that they were lawfully held for anti-piracy security. However, a lower court in India reinstated the charges against the men, leading to their conviction in January 2016 when they were sentenced to five years. Following their eventual acquittals, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the court ruling as ""fantastic news"". ""The FCO has worked tirelessly behind the scenes to reunite these men with their families. The importance the UK Government places on their case cannot be overstated,"" he said. ""The men, their families and their supporters, who have campaigned unrelentingly, must be overjoyed,"" he said."

The awards were to have been judged by Committee on Climate Change chair Lord Deben and Simon Storey, the CEO of industry lobby group the Insulation Manufacturers Association. A letter sent to attendees by event organisers M4 Publishing & Events, seen by Sky News, says they were contacted two weeks ago that the main sponsor, BRE BREEAM, ""inform(ed) us that they could no longer align with the event, citing freedom of information requests from manufacturers, conflict of interest and the avoidance of alignment with any specific manufacturer of insulation"". BRE BREEAM is part of the BRE Group, formerly the Buildings Research Establishment, who also operate the Government's fire safety advisers. Following the title sponsor's exit, the main financial backers of the event withdrew, taking the view that ""if an organisation with the stature of (BRE BREEAM) was withdrawing, there must for some reason be an underlying issue within the industry"". The Chief Executive of BRE, Peter Bonfield, is also on the Government's Independent Building Safety Advisory Panel with fellow director Sir Ken Knight. Following the Sky News documentary, Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, called for BRE to be re-nationalised. ""Bring BRE back into public ownership and accountability. Fire respect should not be influenced by profit,"" he tweeted. The letter goes on to say: ""Yesterday, Sky News reported on various industry issues in regard to fire safety and industry lobbying, as a result of this report and its contents we have not been able to secure the emergency funding we were offered... the event is not commercially viable and is cancelled with immediate effect."" Sky News revealed that elements of the plastics industry were not only helping to write the rules that require more insulation to be fitted to buildings, but were also trying to silence people who questioned whether plastic insulation was safe. :: Last two victims of Grenfell fire are mother and daughter The main lobby group for the plastic insulation trade was, until November 2017, called the British Rigid Urethane Foam Manufacturers' Association (BRUFMA). Partly in response to Grenfell Tower - or what it refers to as ""events of this year"" - BRUFMA changed its name to the Insulation Manufacturers Association. They advertise that they are ""influencing UK and local government, specifying authorities, relevant approval and certification bodies,"" and have ""high level involvement in the drafting and regular revision of British and European standards (and) the Building Regulations."" Its members are promised the ""opportunity to influence Government bodies and NGOs"" and ""direct input into relevant British Standards committees"". Reacting to the Sky News documentary Grenfell: Britain's Fire Safety Crisis, David Lammy MP told Sky News that the findings were ""hugely worrying"" and said that he expected the report ""to be critical to the (Grenfell) public inquiry""."

He was also convicted of the attempted murder of Dr Russell's other daughter Josie, nine, who suffered severe head injuries in the attack on a country lane. Stone has always maintained his innocence and his legal team says they are set to present new evidence which points to Bellfield, whose three murder victims included 13-year-old Milly Dowler. Paul Bacon, one of Stone's barristers, told a press conference in London: ""We have now received evidence of a full confession by Levi Bellfield to the Russell murders. ""In the confession, Bellfield describes how he came across Lin Russell and her two children, how he attacked them with a hammer and his motivation for the killing. ""The confession is detailed and has a number of facts which are not in the public domain."" Stone's barrister, Mark McDonald, said the evidence should be tested by the Court of Appeal and if proven to be true would uncover ""the largest miscarriage of justice since the Birmingham Six"". It is not the first time Bellfield has been accused of involvement in the Russell murders - Stone's solicitor, Paul Bacon, claimed in 2011 that Milly's killer was a better match for the e-fit of the suspect issued during the police manhunt. A jury at Maidstone Crown Court found Stone guilty of murder and attempted murder in October 1998. The convictions were quashed by Court of Appeal judges in 2001 after doubts over key witness Damien Daley, who said Stone confessed to the Russell murders through a heating pipe at Canterbury Prison. However, Stone was convicted again following a second trial at Nottingham Crown Court. Bellfield, who now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for abducting and killing Milly in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. At the time of the trial, the former nightclub bouncer was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy. In November 2016, Met Police closed an investigation into other serious crimes allegedly involving Bellfield, saying all lines of inquiry had been ""exhausted"" and officers had found no evidence linking him to cases for which he had not already been convicted."

He alleges the helpline will be fully open for just two days out of 10 - on 28 and 29 December. But the Department of Work and Pensions pointed out a helpline in Scotland would also be open for use for claimants across the UK on 27 December, while also stressing the closures were usual practice for Bank Holidays. Millions of payments will also be brought forward ahead of Christmas, the department added. Mr Field has written to the Prime Minister to warn that claimants ""risk being exposed to destitution over Christmas"" and urge her to avert a potential ""disaster"". ""The thought of the chaos this will cause to the lives of some of my poorest constituents, and those across the country, is a hugely troubling one,"" he told the PM. The revelation comes weeks after the Department of Work and Pensions decided to eliminate the cost of calling the 0345 number after claimants complained it cost 55p a minute to call from mobiles and 13p a minute from landlines. It was one of a series of changes following the mass introduction of the controversial benefit, including reducing the waiting time for first payments from six weeks to five. Chancellor Philip Hammond also used last week's Budget to announce there will be more help for those facing rent arrears when changing over from existing benefits to Universal Credit. On the Christmas closures, Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke told Sky News: ""We've got the usual operation. The hotline doesn't operate on Bank Holidays but that has been the case for previous Christmases without particular problems. ""Of course a lot of information is available online which has not been the case before, so if people want financial support in advance of Christmas then engage with your local JobCentre"" Charities and Labour say the impact of the delays in payment could mean a bottleneck of worried claimants left short of cash over the festive season. There has also been criticism that the changes to ensure people are not left out of pocket are being phased in next spring, rather than immediately. Mr Gauke told Sky News the delays were merely bureaucratic. ""Getting rid of waiting days, we have to pass a regulation through the House of Commons, so there is a legislative requirement there,"" he said. ""When it comes to the housing benefit transitional payment we have got to work with local authorities, so it can take a bit of time. ""It's operational, practical points we have to get through, before we can implement it, there's no other reason"". A DWP spokesperson said: ""Just like organisations across the country, our offices are closed on public holidays but every year we bring forward over 20 million payments worth more than Â£4bn to benefit claimants. ""Phone lines are open on the 27 December to help people with any urgent payment related enquiries, and open as usual every other day around the Christmas period."""

EU bosses have given Mrs May until Monday to make a fresh offer on key divorce issues if she wants to reach the next phase of Brexit talks - on trade and a transition period - by Christmas. Yet, with the deadline looming, the Prime Minister denied claims a deal has already been struck on the UK's payout to Brussels - although she did not correct suggestions a Brexit bill could be as much as Â£50bn or more. Speaking to Sky News on a visit to Iraq, Mrs May said: ""We are still in negotiations with the EU. ""I set out in my Florence speech that nobody, none of the EU27, would need to worry about having to pay in more or receive less. ""For the current budget plan, I also said that we would honour our commitments and we are still in negotiations with the EU. ""I want to see us able to move forward together into the next stage of the talks when we can look in detail at the deep and special partnership we want to have with the EU once we leave."" The Prime Minister did not rule continuing to pay money to Brussels beyond the current EU budget period, which ends in 2020. ""I have said that we will honour our commitments, I have also said that there may be particular programmes that we want to continue to be a part of,"" she said. ""And if that is the case then, of course, there may be a cost for us to be part of that. ""But, I am very clear that we will not be giving huge sums of money every year to the EU because we are leaving the EU in March 2019."" Mrs May also suggested there might be no detail of the UK's financial settlement, even if it is agreed next month. Leading Brexiteer ministers are believed to have insisted an increased cash offer must come with a guarantee on a trade deal in the second phase of Brexit talks. The Prime Minister said: ""As the EU themselves have said, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."" As well as agreeing a financial settlement, the Prime Minister also needs to meet the EU's requirement for ""sufficient progress"" on Irish border issues and citizens' rights before the EU27 will sanction the second phase of Brexit negotiations. Mrs May claimed Britain and the EU are ""within touching distance"" of an agreement on citizens' rights but she faces a bigger headache over Northern Ireland. Asked whether she will meet the Republic of Ireland's demand for a written guarantee there won't be a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, Mrs May said: ""There is no difference between myself and the parties in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government in wanting to ensure that there will be no hard border."" Ahead of a crunch EU summit on 14/15 December, where EU27 leaders will decide whether to sanction the second phase of Brexit talks, Mrs May added: ""I want to see us moving forward together. ""There have been a number of positive reactions from other European leaders about the importance of these trade talks. ""But I want to ensure that we can go forward together, because I want to build a deep and special partnership with the EU when we have left. ""And I believe that is not just in our interest, I think that's in the interest of continuing to strengthen the EU."""
2017-11-29,A former mental health nurse who killed and cooked his dog before feeding it to his other pet dog has been jailed for two years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/ex-nurse-jailed-for-two-years-after-cooking-dog-for-pet-food-11148945,"Dominic O'Connor will serve another two years under licence in the community and has been issued a life ban from keeping animals after he used a lead to strangle the animal to death in Northern Ireland in December last year. Sentencing the 28-year-old at Downpatrick Crown Court, judge Piers Grant branded the defendant's behaviour ""disgraceful"" and ""heinous"". He said: ""The killing of this innocent, vulnerable dog has clearly been your calculation for some time. ""It is clear that you determined to kill this dog and in doing so inflict on this creature serious cruelty. ""In any view this behaviour is barbaric."" The court heard how O'Connor, of Roden Street, Kircubbin, County Down, bought the dog on the Gumtree website before choking it to death at the second attempt after switching leads. He then shaved the animal, butchered it and cooked its body before using it as pet food for his other dog. The judge said: ""It is appropriate to recognise that the level of cruelty inflicted on this poor animal is very much at the upper end of the spectrum for this type of offending."" He said the crime was calculated as O'Connor knew there was a chance he could have been caught when he disposed some remains in a black bag in nearby Portavogie Harbour. The judge said O'Connor showed no remorse and posed a high risk of reoffending. As he was taken away a member of the public gallery shouted: ""Burn in hell, demon. You are the epitome of evil."" Judge Grant admitted the killing could be indicative of mental illness but said O'Connor's lawyers were unable to produce any reliable medical evidence about his mental health. He also said some of the defendant's 23 unrelated previous convictions demonstrated that he was prepared to act irresponsibly."

At the time Nestle India said: ""Maggi Noodles are completely safe and have been trusted in India for over 30 years. ""The trust of our consumers and the safety of our products is our first priority. Unfortunately, recent developments and unfounded concerns about the product have led to an environment of confusion for the consumer, to such an extent that we have decided to withdraw the product off the shelves, despite the product being safe.

Responding to Mr Trump's actions, Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""It is wrong for the president to have done this. ""Britain First seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which peddles lies and stokes tensions. ""The British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudice of Britain First that is the antithesis of the values of our country."" Despite the controversy, the PM's spokesman said the invitation for Mr Trump to make a state visit to the UK early next year still stands. The President shared three unverified videos including one titled ""Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!"" and another two purporting to show attacks carried out by other Muslims. Fransen, who faces trial next year accused of religiously aggravated harassment, appeared to celebrate the President's actions, tweeting moments later: ""God bless you Trump! God bless America!"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President's retweets, telling reporters: ""Whether it's a real video, the threat is real and that is what the President is talking about. ""His goal is to promote strong border security and strong national security,"" she added. Last year, MPs called for Britain First to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation after the murder of MP Jo Cox, who was killed by a right-wing extremist shouting ""Britain first"". :: A history of Donald Trump's Twitter insults Ms Cox's widower Brendan criticised Mr Trump for retweeting the group's videos, saying the President ""should be ashamed of himself"". ""Trump has legitimised the far-right in his own country, now he's trying to do it in ours,"" Mr Cox wrote on Twitter. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had called on the Government to condemn Mr Trump's actions which he described as ""abhorrent, dangerous and a threat to our society"". Meanwhile, former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna called for the President's planned state visit to the UK to be scrapped. ""Words do not do justice to this. He is normalising hatred,"" Mr Umunna told Sky News. ""I don't think he is welcome here."" Fransen, from Penge, south-east London, is on bail facing trial over four charges of causing religiously aggravated harassment after an investigation into the distribution of leaflets and the posting of online videos during a trial last May. The 31-year-old will go on trial at Folkestone Magistrates' Court on 29 January, alongside Britain First leader Paul Golding, who faces three similar charges. Fransen will also appear in court in Northern Ireland in December charged with using threatening and abusive language in connection with a speech she made at an anti-terrorism demonstration in Belfast on 6 August."
2017-11-29,MPs have called for reassurances over the future of the UK's free-to-use cash machines after proposed changes prompted fears that thousands could close.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-call-for-reassurance-over-atm-desert-concerns-11148766,"LINK, the company that operates Britain's ATM network, has said it plans to cut the fees charged to card issuers by the machines' owners from 25p to 20p per withdrawal, over the next four years. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Select Committee (TSC), has written to Sir Mark Boleat, chairman of LINK, after concerns the plans could lead to ""ATM deserts"" for communities if as seemed likely some machines became economically unviable. She said: ""I have asked LINK for assurances that the proposals will preserve the existing geographic spread of ATMs, and will have no negative impact on financial inclusion."" The MP also pointed to figures showing 2.7 million people, or 5% of UK adults, were still almost entirely reliant on cash transactions. LINK said its proposals earlier this month came because of the sharp fall in consumers' demand for cash as people increasingly use contactless and online payments. It said there would still be an extensive network of free cash machines and that any reduction would likely be in areas where there are currently a number of them close together. LINK also said that the number of cashpoints was at near-record levels, with more than 70,000 across the country, of which 55,000 are free to use. Sir Mark said: ""LINK is committed to maintaining an extensive free network of ATMs for consumers for years to come. ""LINK's independent board believes that reform is required to interchange and that it is currently too high. ""In particular, we do not see the growth of ATMs that is under way as sustainable, given the declining use of cash for making payments."" But the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA), representing the owners of the machines, has said thousands of free-to-use cash dispensers could go - with some starting to charge customers and others disappearing completely. Ron Delnevo, executive director for Europe of ATMIA, said: ""It is wonderful news that the TSC is examining this threat to financial inclusion with the urgency that it warrants. ""It is now essential that Link addresses these concerns with adequate and detailed responses."""
2017-11-29,Daniel Day-Lewis has confirmed his latest film will be his last.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/daniel-day-lewis-i-didnt-know-phantom-thread-would-be-my-last-film-11148805,"In an interview with W Magazine, the acclaimed English actor confirmed rumours that his role as dress maker Reynolds Woodcock in Paul Thomas Anderson's Oscar-bound Phantom Thread was a career-changer. ""Before making the film, I didn't know I was going to stop acting,"" he said. ""I do know that Paul and I laughed a lot before we made the movie. And then we stopped laughing because we were both overwhelmed by a sense of sadness,"" he explained. :: Daniel Day-Lewis: The end of acting ""That took us by surprise: We didn't realise what we had given birth to. It was hard to live with. And still is."" It may sound ominous, but it is in line with what we've come to expect from the artist. Known for his extreme method acting, Day-Lewis has metamorphosed from woodworking apprentice to one of the best actors working in Hollywood today. But acting has never been a passion for him, more of a guilty pleasure. ""Daniel hates acting,"" said director Jim Sheridan, who worked with Day-Lewis in The Ballad Of Jack And Rose. In the unusually personal interview the actor gave W Magazine, he confesses acting for him was always more of ""an illusion of inevitability"" for a man who always dreamed of pursuing manual work. ""In the case of Phantom Thread, when we started I had no curiosity about the fashion world,"" he said. ""I didn't want to be drawn into it. Even now, fashion itself doesn't really interest me. ""In the beginning, we didn't know what profession the protagonist would have. We chose fashion and then realised: What the hell have we let ourselves into? And then the fashion world got its hooks into me."" Less than prolific, Day-Lewis has always taken extended breaks between his films, but taken each role with the dedication of an old craftsman. ""I need to believe in the value of what I'm doing,"" he said. ""The work can seem vital. Irresistible, even. And if an audience believes it, that should be good enough for me. But, lately, it isn't."" As for starting a career as a couturier, Day-Lewis was, again, ominous. ""Who knows?,"" he said, when asked about the rumours which suggested his last role may have pushed him towards dressmaking. ""I won't know which way to go for a while. But I'm not going to stay idle,"" he said. ""I don't fear the stony silence."" Phantom Thread will have a preview at London's Southbank Centre on 31 January before opening in cinemas on 2 February."

However, in an interview with Sky News, the Prime Minister twice refused to rule out reducing the overall size of the British Army following a Ministry of Defence spending review in January. She said: ""We will maintain our NATO commitment of 2% of GDP being spent on defence. ""What we are doing is ensuring that we are increasing the defence budget. ""We need to look at how we most effectively spend that increased and rising defence budget. ""It is about looking at the threats that we face and ensuring we have the capabilities to meet those threats."" Defence minister Tobias Ellwood has reportedly threatened to resign if troop numbers drop below 70,000. A number of Conservative backbenchers are also demanding guarantees from the Prime Minister that the British Army will not be hollowed out by January's review. Speaking at Taji military base, north of Iraqi capital Baghdad, Mrs May also explained the purpose of UK efforts to train local security forces. ""It is about ensuring that Iraqi forces are able to conduct the operations they need to conduct themselves,"" she said. ""Iraqi forces have been active, they have been seeing military success against Daesh. ""We have seen that in the fall of Mosul."" Military success against IS means the extremists are increasingly losing control of their territory and resources. But, in response, the jihadists have become less structured and adopted more fluid tactics. To counter this threat, the UK will invest Â£10m over the next three years to build Iraq's counter-terrorism capability. Britain will also help to develop border infrastructure, watch lists and biometric capabilities in order to counter the dispersal of foreign fighters across Iraq. The Prime Minister also announced on Wednesday the UK will continue to support Iraqi defence and security forces."

The all-rounder - who is currently suspended from playing for England by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) - is in New Zealand after flying to Christchurch to see his extended family. The 26-year-old, who plays for Durham, has not been ruled out of the five-Test Ashes series but the ECB says it will not consider him for selection until further notice. Police said they have completed their preliminary inquiry and are seeking advice about how to proceed from the Crown Prosecution Service. A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: ""We are now in a position to provide an update on our investigation into a disorder in Bristol which happened during the early hours of Monday 25 September. ""A 27-year-old man suffered a fractured eye socket in the incident on Queens Road, Clifton.

2017-11-29,The Natural History Museum has said it will stop selling single-use plastic water bottles as part of efforts to reduce pollution in the world's oceans.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/natural-history-museum-stops-using-plastic-bottles-11148932,"The restaurants and other facilities at the sites in South Kensington in west London and Tring in Hertfordshire will be assessed to check if alternative ways can be found of dispensing water. Water fountains and reusable bottles are among the options being looked at and visitors are likely to be expected to bring their own containers. The museum has already stopped offering plastic straws and is looking at the use of plastic in general across its locations. It comes amid Sky's Sky Ocean Rescue campaign, which aims to stop single use plastic being dumped in the sea. The Oval cricket ground has also said it aims to go plastic free in the next three years. Research by the Natural History Museum and Royal Holloway University of London has previously revealed the extent of unseen plastic pollution in the Thames and the amount of plastic in the stomachs of fish in the river. Professor Ian Owens, director of science at the museum, said: ""It's vital that scientific institutions like the museum lead the way in the fight to understand and protect the natural world. ""The scale of ongoing plastic pollution is having a devastating effect on many marine species and the ecosystems that sustain life on Earth. ""Millions of single-use plastic bottles are purchased every day in the UK alone, and billions end up in the sea every year. ""The museum is visited by over 4.5 million people every year and reaches millions more all over the world through our digital channels. ""Our plan to stop selling single-use plastic water bottles is about becoming part of the movement towards a refillable culture and doing our part to encourage a mass lifestyle change that will help reduce the deluge of plastic into our seas."" The move is taking place amid growing concern about the consequences of relying on existing structures of waste disposal. A growing number of pressure bodies are asserting a mantra of ""reduce, reuse and recycle"" as the way to combat the burgeoning plastic mountain, instead of purely relying on recycling. The Institute of Engineering and Technology's magazine E&T recently reported that China, which handles more than half of the UK's recycling, had started refusing to take shipments because the quality of rubbish sent to be processed was too poor."
2017-11-29,"People with degenerative diseases are being put under ""extra stress"" by having to undergoing reassessments of their health so they can continue to receive benefits, say campaigners.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/people-with-degenerative-diseases-still-facing-benefits-reassessments-11149164,"Currently, anyone who is diagnosed with a medical condition that will continue to get worse only has to undergo one test to determine if they are entitled to Employment Support Allowance. But, anyone who was assessed before a rule change in September, has been told they must undergo a new assessment to make sure they continue to qualify. The MND Association has launched a petition calling on the Government to exempt people with motor neurone disease (MND) from having to be routinely reassessed for disability payouts. MND, also known as ALS, is a fatal and rapidly progressing disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It attacks the nerves that control movement, and those who are diagnosed are eventually left unable to walk, talk or swallow. A third of people who are diagnosed with MND die within 12 months of diagnosis. Some, like Stephen Hawking, live on for many years. Susie Rabin, head of policy and campaigns at MND Association, told Sky News they are ""very concerned"" that people with MND currently in receipt of benefits will have to be reassessed ""to establish that they are still terminally ill."" ""We think that's a little bit bonkers,"" she told Sky News. ""It's extra stress and trauma being put on people at a time when they just really need to carry on having support,"" Ms Rabin added. ""If you have an illness like MND, it will not have got any better."" MND was the subject of a global campaign in 2014, the ice bucket challenge, which saw people tipping buckets of ice cold water over their heads and nominating others to do the same. It raised more than Â£7m for the MND Association in the UK, and $115m for the ALS Association in the US. Liam Dwyer, 54, suffers from MND, and was sent a Capability for Work questionnaire twice this summer. He uses a wheelchair and has trouble speaking, but he spoke to Sky News via email. ""I had to retire from work after two months,"" said Liam, who was a building manager with a large building company. ""It was unsafe to stay working on site after two falls, and my speech was getting slurred. I was asked by a person on site if I was still drunk as it was an early Monday morning."" ""The DWP has sent me out a 24-page from to fill in and because I can't hold a pen it's another job for my wife."" He said if the Department for Work and Pensions looked at what MND was, they would not need to reassess people who have it. In September, the Government changed the rules on who did and did not need to undergo regular assessments to receive disability benefits. Previously, anyone who claimed benefits was subjected to medical tests every six months to determine whether they were fit for work. Afterwards, people with severe lifelong conditions like MND and Parkinson's disease were told they would no longer need to be routinely assessed. But those who were assessed before the rule change, regardless of whether they were judged unable to work, were told they must still endure a test. Warren, 68, was diagnosed with MND in August. His daughter Katie, 34, told Sky News there's a ""massive lack of understanding"" of the disease. ""It is heart breaking to watch him deteriorate and to know that there is never going to be a happy ending. ""This isn't made any easier by the existing bureaucratic processes in place and lack of understanding of this cruel condition."" Parkinson's UK also says it too is concerned people with the disease will have to deal with the ""stress and anxiety"" of a reassessment. Phil Reynolds, senior policy and campaigns adviser at Parkinson's UK, told Sky News: ""We fear that many people with Parkinson's still won't be protected from the trauma and indignity of pointless ESA assessments."" A DWP spokesperson told Sky News: ""We're making sure that people with severe health conditions or disabilities who are unlikely to ever be able to move into work, no longer need to attend routine assessments to receive the benefits they're entitled to. ""We've worked closely with healthcare professionals, disability charities and a number of other organisations to develop clear criteria and guidance. ""We have apologised to Mr Dwyer for the clerical error which led to him receiving unnecessary reassessment letters earlier this year."""
2017-11-29,"The country's most senior military officers were recently summoned to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for a ""non-negotiable meeting"" and a ""dressing down"" after a recent stream of leaks to the media giving details about planned defence cuts.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/senior-military-officers-dressed-down-after-leaks-over-defence-cuts-11148583,"Sky News understands that Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary in the MoD, has been forced to make the warning on two occasions in recent weeks. Five separate sources have independently confirmed the events. One described it as a ""chest-poking"", although another said it ""didn't quite go as far as a b*********"". A series of leaks since the summer have revealed private proposals for cuts as the MoD finds ways to save money. Among the more notable leaks has been news that the Royal Marines might be reduced by 1,000 personnel; a possibility that the UK's two amphibious ships might be scrapped early; and the threat of selling 28 Wildcat helicopters. The leaks have exposed divisions between the Army, Navy and RAF as each tries to limit the impact on its service. It is understood there was even a plan to suspend the high-level Armed Forces Committee, attended by the top military personnel and MoD officials, as a desperate attempt to plug the hole. ""There was too much stuff going around that could only have come from this small group of people,"" a defence insider said. The leaks included ""levels of detail and private conversations that shouldn't have been made public"". ""No one is accusing the chiefs themselves of leaking but there are suggestions that some of the detail has found its way to the media via proxies,"" the insider added. In the end, the suspension of the Armed Forces Committee never went ahead because Sir Michael Fallon left office suddenly following revelations about his behaviour. :: Sir Michael Fallon breaks silence with defence cuts warning:: Theresa May facing Tory rebellion over possible defence cuts Instead the permanent secretary ended up taking the meeting in his office on the fifth floor of the MoD because Sir Michael was downstairs resigning at the time. It is understood the five most senior officers in the Armed Forces were present: General Sir Nick Carter, the head of the Army; General Sir Chris Deverell, who is commander of the Joint Forces Command; Air Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, the Chief of the Air Staff; and Admiral Sir Philip Jones, the First Sea Lord. A third source familiar with the warnings admitted they were ""probably quite a sensible thing to do"". Mark Sedwill is the national security adviser - he has been asked by Theresa May to carry out a review of national security following the summer terror attacks and resurging threat from Russia. Although the review is strategic in name, it is widely feared to be an excuse for more cuts to the Armed Forces. Asked if the leaks were effective in helping prevent cuts, though, the source replied: ""Imagine what the national security adviser is making of all this? He must see a homogeneous bunch of public schoolboys just trying to get attention. ""This isn't the way to fight our corner and make our case. Sedwill will be thinking, 'What resonates with an ex-home secretary Prime Minister - more tanks to be possibly used in some far off World War III, or cyber, the threat of now and device of modern warfare?'"" A few weeks after the initial meeting, Stephen Lovegrove was forced to write a letter reiterating his warning after further leaks to the media. According to one individual who has seen the letter, the permanent secretary re-emphasised the need for trust and warned that there could be an impact on the way the services work together if further leaks appear in the media. It will not be popular that news of this letter has subsequently been leaked to Sky News but Number 10 was reportedly keen that action was taken to stop the briefings. ""There was anger in Downing Street, the PM wasn't happy,"" Sky News has been told. ""Various services have spent so long at war with each other that they have left their flank open to seeing resources and money handed over to Mark Sedwill and his growing empire."" The MoD says it refuses to comment on private meetings."

The closure figure was on top of 100 others announced earlier this year. The bank cited then, as it did on Wednesday, a declining number of transactions in branches for the decision. A spokesman said: ""Customers are increasingly choosing to use digital and mobile channels for their everyday banking needs. ""As a consequence, the number of customers visiting some of our branches has declined in recent years. ""In response to this, we have confirmed the locations of some branches which will close next year across Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland."" The Unite union responded by saying Lloyds was ignoring its ""corporate social responsibilities"". National officer Rob MacGregor said: ""Lloyds Banking Group needs to halt this unnecessary bank branch closure programme. ""Local communities are making it clear that the closure of their local branch excludes customers who cannot use digital means to conduct their financial transactions."" Yorkshire Building Society said it was wielding the axe at its operations for different reasons. It said an efficiency drive would mean 13 branches disappearing and 250 workers losing their jobs - the bulk of them at its Cheltenham office which is facing closure. The group said it was particularly keen to avoid duplication in the business and ensure it had a ""more even spread of branches and agencies across the country"". Its plans included opening more agency operations - services inside other local offices such as estate agencies or solicitors - to offer customers the same service more widely. Earlier this year, more than 400 jobs were put under threat at Yorkshire after it announced plans to shut 48 branches and axe the Norwich & Peterborough brand from the high street. The two providers confirmed their plans as MPs demanded answers in a separate row amid fears for the future of the country's free-to-use cash machine network."

It comes two weeks ahead of a crunch summit in Brussels at which Theresa May must give assurances about the status of EU citizens who are already living in the UK, if Britain is to move on to negotiating a trade deal with the EU. With three million people employed in construction, they say their concerns must be acknowledged, but Mrs May faces increasingly vocal concerns from other sectors reliant on migrant labour, including hospitality and agriculture. Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, the largest trade association, said without an indication of what immigration system will replace free movement, EU workers would soon start leaving for other countries. ""I think the Government is finding it very tricky to be clear cut, while it is negotiating with the European Union. But we're facing a cliff edge. ""We don't know, post-2019, what the Government's regime is going to be, and that will have a detrimental effect on the provision of more housing and infrastructure which we desperately need in the post-Brexit era."" Steve Radley, head of policy at the Construction Industry Training Board, set up in the 1960s to boost apprenticeships, said: ""We have a key period coming up at Christmas, there's obviously a risk that some (EU staff) will go home for Christmas and not come back. ""I think industry is really looking at maybe a transition period of about five years or so, to really put the plans in place to ramp up apprenticeship numbers, to get recruitment going and attract people from other sectors."" Ministers have announced this month that 300,000 homes a year must be built to meet a national shortage. The Government has also published an industrial strategy aimed at building infrastructure ""fit for the future"". In the capital, the pressure to build homes is particularly acute. At a site in west London where Cuttle Construction is developing a row of basement flats, about 80% of staff hail from abroad. Mark Flynn, project manager at the site, where English and Irish staff are outnumbered by those from eastern Europe, told Sky News: ""As it stands, we have a good workforce. But if fresh people are limited from coming in, it would soon thin out. ""I think you'd have to offer the English and Irish guys more money to do the things the guys from eastern Europe are happier to do. They are into different things now, they find computers and other industries more appealing than hard work. ""You always hear of people here wanting to be electricians and plumbers. You don't hear of so many people wanting to be labourers. It's earlier starts, you're quite often outside exposed to the elementsâ¦ it's not the easiest game to be in."" Site foreman Brian O'Donnell said strict restrictions on EU workers would certainly increase costs. ""There will be trouble, there will be serious problems if you can't get the workforce, you can't get the work done."" Mihai, from Romania, who moved to Britain 11 years ago and works on the site, said he was confident of being able to stay after Brexit but said the future was uncertain for newer arrivals, and countries like Germany might have more appeal. ""For people coming now, it's very difficult, a lot of people have children born here, at school, they have houses. They are scared about what's going to happen after 2019,"" he said. At Nescot further education college in Epsom, Surrey, hundreds of students are training to be carpenters, bricklayers and electricians. Industry bodies say there has been increased interest in more vocational courses in the last two years but it will take time to meet the skills shortage. Dave Lewin, director of the college's construction courses, said: ""Certainly to meet the Government's building agenda - 300,000 homes a year - we are going to have to work very closely with industry to make sure our young people are capable of fulfilling that need."" But he added: ""Apprentices make good money from day one. Yes it's hard labour, it's hard graft involved but there's huge opportunities and young people can see that."" A Home Office spokesperson said in response to the construction industry's manifesto: ""We are carefully considering the options for the future immigration system and will set out our plans shortly. ""We have already been clear there will be an implementation period after we leave the EU to avoid a cliff edge for businesses and that EU citizens already working in the UK will be able to apply for settled status so they can stay."""
2017-11-29,It was the first time that I'd seen Harry and Meghan together. There was no way I'd expected them to appear somewhere as open and public as Nathan Phillips Square in the middle of Toronto.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/getting-to-know-meghan-markle-how-love-flourished-with-prince-harry-11146377,"But on 25 September, around 14 months after they started dating, they walked straight past me at the Invictus Games. Holding hands, and without uttering a word, they were making a very clear statement to the world's media. This was the real thing. For a royal correspondent finding out about Meghan has been a joy. There's so much about her online and lots of it put out there by the actress herself. Playing the paralegal Rachel Zane, in the legal drama Suits, really boosted her profile, and like any ambitious starlet she worked hard to build her online ""brand"". Her own blog ""The Tig"" and her Instagram account gave her fans a very open window into Meghan's world. Her blog was closed down shortly after we found out she was dating Harry, but her Instagram is still a high-definition, filter- enhanced picture book of her life. You can find photos of her friends, her dogs, her family and the famous people she's rubbed shoulders with, from her co-stars on Suits, to Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama. It also gives you a fascinating insight into how this future royal views the world, with motivational quotes liberally scattered amongst the photographs. One that really stands out is: ""Teach your daughters to worry less about fitting into glass slippers and more about shattering glass ceilings"". Very telling when you consider the life that lies ahead of her. For all the posing and pouting at red carpet events, this is a woman of substance. A self-proclaimed activist and feminist, who was invited to be a UN advocate for women's political participation, she spoke at the United Nations on International Women's day in 2015, saying: ""We need a global understanding that we cannot implement change effectively without women's political participation."" Ahead of the US elections she made it clear she wouldn't be voting for Donald Trump, saying in an interview: ""As misogynistic as Trump is, and so vocal about it, that's a huge chunk of it. You're not just voting for a woman, if it's Hilary, because she's a woman, but certainly because Trump has made it easy to see that you don't really want that kind of world that he's painting"". It's exciting to see a punchy woman who hasn't been afraid to speak out on difficult subjects joining the House of Windsor. But it will be interesting to see how she mixes her compulsion for campaigning with her new responsibilities as a member of ""The Firm"". Don't forget that politics is off limits when you're a royal. Through her charity work with World Vision, Meghan has travelled to Rwanda for their clean water campaign. She also visited India to show how the potential of young girls is being compromised because of the stigma surrounding menstruation. The comparisons with Princess Diana will inevitably come thick and fast, especially from her homeland of America, where they still have an obsession with Harry's mother, 20 years after she died. One aspect of Meghan that has already attracted attention is her ethnicity. And it is a subject she hasn't shied away from as a proud bi-racial woman, brought up by an African-American mum and a white father. In an article for Elle magazine she described how her parents ""crafted a world around me to make me feel like I wasn't different, but special"". For Christmas her mum and dad bought her one black doll and one white doll. It's an upbringing that has encouraged her to speak out about racial equality. She is the first mixed-race person to be marrying into the British royal family. Commentators have described it as socially momentous for the country, and a good reason to get us talking about diversity and social mobility. It's also been suggested it is an opportunity for black people to feel more connected to the all-white palace lineage. It is a significant moment and another move towards modernity for a family that under the reign of Harry's grandmother has constantly adjusted and changed, to make sure the monarchy remains accessible and relevant. Harry and Meghan have got plenty in common. Just start with their humanitarian work; you'll find no shortage of pictures of them both dancing and hugging little children. Both are from divorced families, funnily enough they seem to share a love of dogs, and they are used to being in the spotlight. But their whirlwind romance has still taken the world by surprise; the Queen's grandson hooking up with an American divorcee, who's appeared in her underwear on TV. Her own high-profile career means that most of the skeletons are already well and truly out of the closet."
2017-11-29,"War criminal Slobodan Praljak has died in hospital after drinking what he claimed to be poison during a court appearance, Croatia's prime minister has confirmed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/war-criminal-slobodan-praljak-dies-after-taking-poison-in-court-11148960,"The former Croatian army chief drank from a small bottle and yelled ""I am not a war criminal, I oppose this conviction"" when his 20-year sentence was upheld by UN judges at The Hague. The dramatic turn of events, which was broadcast on a video feed, forced the judges to temporarily suspend the hearing, with paramedics seen entering the courtroom. The hearing resumed a few hours after the shocking development, with presiding judge Carmel Aguis saying: ""Courtroom one is now a crime scene."" :: The deadly legacy of the Balkan wars Dutch police say they are investigating. Praljak was convicted of involvement in a campaign to drive Muslims out of Bosnia and create an ethnically pure Croat state during the Bosnian war in the 1990s sparked by the break-up of Yugoslavia. The conflict mainly saw Bosnian Muslims fighting Bosnian Serbs, but there were also deadly clashes involving Bosnian Muslims and Croats after an alliance fell apart. A total of 100,000 people died and 2.2 million were displaced in the three-year war. Croatian PM Andrej Plenkovic said: ""We have all unfortunately witnessed his act by which he took his own life."" He said Praljak's course of action reflects the ""deep moral injustice"" suffered by six Bosnian Croats who unsuccessfully appealed against their convictions at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Some of Paljak's convictions were overturned, but the judge left his sentence unchanged. The six includes former defence minister Jadranko Prlic, whose 25-year sentence for involvement in the campaign to create an ethnically pure state was upheld. The court last week convicted former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic of genocide. Croatia claims it has ""clean hands"" over the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and wanted the decision overturned. Zagreb has also expressed anger at the UN judges for upholding a finding that the late Croat president Franjo Tudman was part of a plan to create a ministate in Bosnia. Tudjman's son, Miroslav, said Praljak's move was a ""consequence of his moral position not to accept the verdict that has nothing to do with justice or reality"". The remaining three suspects - Milivoj Petkovic, 68, Valentin Coric, 61, and Berislav Pusic, 65 - had their sentences confirmed. The court, established by the UN in 1993, is due to close when its mandate expires at the end of this year. It has indicted 161 suspects, of which 90 have been convicted."

Joint administrators at the business services firm PwC said P&H employed 3,400 people but they had needed to make immediate redundancies at its head office and in the branch network of 14 regional distribution centres. They confirmed just 450 people were currently being kept on to assist in managing the activities of the business to an orderly closure, adding that November's salaries had been paid. The shopworkers' union, Usdaw, said it was seeking an urgent meeting with PwC. The demise of P&H, while devastating for workers, also risks disruption in supplies to UK stores and restaurants. It was the country's largest delivered wholesaler to the convenience market with 90,000 customers in total, including the large supermarket chains. Costcutter was among them. A spokesman said: ""We have activated our contingency plans to provide alternative sources of supply through appropriate regional and national options."" Tobacco firm Imperial Brands - which had lent financial support to P&H along with rivals - said that while it had contingency plans in place to mitigate supply problems it estimated a Â£160m hit to its own operating profits - mainly from unrecoverable excise duty. It said: ""P&H has been a long-standing trading partner in the UK and for several months Imperial has been working to find a solution that provides the business, and its employees, with a sustainable long-term future. ""Imperial was prepared to explore further alternatives but other parties have been unwilling to pursue these to a successful conclusion."" PwC explained: ""The group has been by hit by challenging trading conditions in recent months and efforts to restructure the business have been unsuccessful. ""This has resulted in cash flow pressures and it has not been possible to secure additional funding to support the business."" Joint administrator Matthew Callaghan added: ""This is a devastating blow for everyone who has been involved in the business. ""The administration team will focus on working with employees, clients and suppliers to facilitate a smooth and effective wind-down or transfer of operations over the next few weeks. ""The P&H Group has faced a challenging trading environment, and the need for significant restructuring has been recognised for some while. ""The company has insufficient cash resources to continue to trade beyond the short term and the directors have concluded that there is no longer any reasonable prospect of a sale. ""Therefore, the directors have had no choice but appoint administrators. ""The administrators are working closely with employees affected by the closure of the business to ensure they receive the support they need during this difficult time to assist with their claims for redundancy and other compensatorypayments. ""Our priority is to ensure that all employees made redundant are assisted in processing their claims with immediate effect."""

2017-11-29,Rail lines which were closed during the Beeching cuts in the 1960s could be reopened and some big franchises split up under Government plans.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/rail-lines-shut-during-1960s-beeching-cuts-could-be-reopened-11148434,"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said he wanted to open up routes which would encourage housebuilding, ease overcrowding and boost the economy. The proposals also include splitting up the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise serving London and parts of the south east in 2021. Great Western - serving the South West and South Wales and currently run by First Group - could also be broken up under the plans. But Labour has dismissed the plans as ""unambitious"" - with transport campaigners warning it is ""desperately difficult to reopen a rail line"". Thousands of stations and hundreds of local rail lines were closed down between 1964 and 1970 on the recommendation of the then British Railways chairman Dr Richard Beeching. The Government's rail strategy, which includes restoring lost capacity, is being published on Wednesday. Mr Grayling told Sky News: ""I certainly want to start the process of bringing back into use some of the lines that disappeared from passenger use about 50 years ago - and where there's a real need now. ""If you look for example around Bristol, where you've got an overcrowded city, lots of traffic in the city centre, there's a desperate need to improve suburban rail routes. ""And we've got a lot of routes that have been taken out of passenger service for a long time, which I want to see re-enter service in the years ahead and we're working to try and achieve that."" But he admitted re-opening some routes would be ""problematic"" and ""very expensive"". :: Grayling: 'No deal' Brexit 'could turn M20 into lorry park' The Department for Transport (DfT) has pledged to ""accelerate"" the reopening of the railway between Oxford and Cambridge. Last week's Budget confirmed Network Rail will be handed funding to deliver phase two of the western section of East West Rail, from Bicester to Bedford, and Milton Keynes to Princes Risborough, with plans to open in 2023. The East West Rail Company will be set up as an independent entity to deliver the central section between Bedford and Cambridge to open in the mid-2020s. Andy McDonald, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said the plan to reopen lines is ""more jam tomorrow from a Government which has run out of ideas"". He said: ""The Tories' record is of delayed, downgraded and cancelled investment, huge disparities in regional transport spending and soaring fares that are pricing passengers off the railway. ""This unambitious strategy stands in contrast to Labour's plan to upgrade and expand the rail network across the country."" Bruce Williamson, from campaign group Railfuture, welcomed the plans and said where lines have been reopened they have ""generally speaking exceeded all expectations"". Last year Mr Grayling said he wants publicly owned Network Rail to share its responsibility for running tracks with private train operators."
2017-11-29,"The sight of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting married is enough to ""cheer people up"" without creating a bank holiday, Theresa May has suggested.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-reveals-why-there-wont-be-a-royal-wedding-bank-holiday-11148699,"The PM defended her decision not to give the nation a day off for the Royal wedding on a trip to the Middle East. After calls for the special day to be marked in the same way as Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding, Mrs May talked down the idea. Asked whether a bank holiday should be created to cheer up the nation, she told Sky News: ""You talk about cheering people up. I think seeing two young people in love (does that). ""I didn't see all of the BBC interview, but I saw snatches of it, and that was obvious. ""They've given a lot of thought as to what it means to be a modern Royal couple in today's age. ""I wish them great happiness for the future and I think the country is delighted to see this engagement and collectively we wish them all the very best."" :: Harry and Meghan's relationship - in their words:: The church, the dress, the house, the ring A survey by YouGov suggests 38% of people would back another bank holiday for the wedding in May, while 48% think there should not be one. Some commentators suggested giving workers another day off would have been an unusual move when the Royal wedding news broke on the same day the Government published its industrial strategy. The document's main aim was to tackle Britain's productivity ""weakness""."
2017-11-29,"Following her engagement to Prince Harry, the Royal Family have announced that Meghan Markle intends to become a UK citizen.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171129194539/https://news.sky.com/story/becoming-a-brit-what-will-meghan-markle-have-to-do-to-get-uk-citizenship-11147904,"But it requires more than just getting married. For most newlyweds it is a process that takes years, a series of different visas, and tests and checks that can be fiendishly tough. If Ms Markle is following the same process as most non-EEA nationals, marrying Harry will not mean an automatic UK passport: she'll need to apply for a fiancee or spouse visa. :: Harry and Meghan reveal their wedding venue To be granted that, she must meet a range of ""suitability"" criteria, as well as vouching that her and Harry are the real deal, showing they intend to live permanently together in the UK and have a ""genuine relationship"". While Monday's interview has convinced the nation of the couple's affections, some applicants face being quizzed by immigration officers, or providing personal information such as messages and photographs. The betrothed must also meet a minimum income rule, which stipulates that a Briton must earn at least Â£18,600 a year - or have savings equivalent to Â£62,500 - to bring their partner to the UK. The fortunes of both Meghan and Harry mean that's not a problem. But the requirement has also been criticised because around 40% of workers in the UK earn less than the threshold. Furthermore, it is thousands higher for people with children, meaning it can result in families being separated. ""It's designed to test people on modest incomes, and people on low incomes obviously won't satisfy that,"" immigration barrister Adrian Berry told Sky News. Partners also need to show they can support their spouse ""without recourse to public funds"", and show evidence they have suitable accommodation that is not overcrowded or dangerous. Luckily for Meghan and Harry, the Royal Family's income is not classed as public funds. Whether he will have to present a tenancy agreement for Nottingham Cottage is unclear. When these criteria are met, it is possible for the non-EEA national to live legally in the UK. But citizenship is still many years away. If the normal rules are in place, Ms Markle can only apply for citizenship after she has had three years of lawful residence in the UK, with indefinite leave to remain. But indefinite leave takes five years to acquire - demanding two separate visas each lasting two and a half years. The cost of this? At the moment it's around Â£7,000 in fees and processing. But as the bill to the Home Office is increasing by 20% each year it will be more expensive when Ms Markle has reached the end of the process. That's not the end of the process though. To have the status approved there are a few more hoops to jump through - not least the notorious life in the UK citizenship test, requiring the applicant to swot up on about 3,000 facts and 278 historical dates. Ms Markle, who in an interview last year failed to recognise Cockney rhyming slang, may have some revision to do. If that all sounds like too much hard work, there may be a 'get-out clause' for the future royal. ""In exceptional cases they don't have to apply the rules as they do generally,"" immigration expert Mr Berry said. ""And I imagine this may be a case that they judge exceptional""."

The 24-year-old is thought to have been working in the city, which had been under IS control for three-and-a-half-years, when he was caught in an explosion and fatally injured. He is the seventh Briton to have died in the country while fighting with YPG fighters. Mr Hall's family have been informed. :: Jac Holmes: British sniper who fought IS killed by landmine in Raqqa Kurdish Solidarity Campaign co-chairman Mark Campbell said: ""It is with deep regret and sorrow that I can confirm via Kurdish sources in Syria that Ollie Hall, a UK national who travelled to Syria in August to help in the liberation of the ISIS city of Raqqa with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), fell on 25 November from an explosion of ordnance left by Daesh after the liberation of the city. ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Ollie at this time."" The death comes after social media posts appeared to show Mr Hall wearing camouflage and carrying weapons with messages pledging solidarity between Britain and Syria. Friends at home can be seen posting good luck messages in response. Other British nationals who have died fighting IS include sniper Jac Holmes, 24, who was also killed while clearing mines, and Mehmet Aksoy, 32, who died in an IS attack.

2017-11-30,"The DUP have warned the Government they might no longer be able to count on their votes, if they detect any change to the Prime Minister's policy of treating the UK as one unitary state in Brexit negotiations.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171130202736/https://news.sky.com/story/dup-warns-government-brexit-border-issue-could-destablise-confidence-deal-11150379,"Sky News has learnt party officials met senior members of the Government on Thursday morning to discuss the issue. There had been speculation that Mrs May and her ministers may consider ""regulatory convergence"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic as a way of breaking the negotiations deadlock and progressing to trade talks. But the DUP have made clear that they would regard such convergence as tantamount to keeping Northern Ireland within the EU customs union, thus creating a new unofficial border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This, they insisted, would be unacceptable, and therefore would call into question the ""confidence and supply"" arrangement by which the DUP agreed with the Conservatives earlier this year. A senior DUP source told Sky News: ""The UK Government knows that any agreement with the EU that Northern Ireland should stay in the single market or the customs union or its regulatory equivalent would be deeply destabilising to the confidence and supply agreement."" The party's 10 MPs have been voting with the Conservatives on the Queen's Speech, Budget and Brexit. But its agreement does not cover the precise outcome of the EU divorce deal. Ireland is demanding the UK make a written commitment to convergence, or that either the UK or Northern Ireland remain in the single market or customs Union to ensure there is no hard border. Reports from Brussels suggest five written commitments have been drafted for the UK to sign up to before negotiations can move to phase two. Earlier on Thursday, DUP MP Ian Paisley retweeted a former Stormont minister's warning: ""Beware of the Tories as the UK moves towards first stage agreement of BREXIT with the EU. ""Some senior advisers within NIO (Northern Ireland Office) may not have the best interests of NI. This will be a testing time for the DUP if they are to continue to keep the present government in power!"". DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""Her Majesty's Government have a clear understanding that the DUP will not countenance any arrangement that could lead to a new border being created in the Irish Sea. ""Indeed, the Prime Minister has been categorical on this matter in the House of Commons. ""We reiterated that United Kingdom-Republic of Ireland arrangements may be necessary as we exit the EU but there can be no arrangements agreed that compromise the integrity of the UK single market and place barriers, real or perceived, to the free movement of goods, services and capital between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom"". UK and EU officials are expected to try to hammer out an agreement on the Irish border over the weekend as the PM prepares for a crucial meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday. On Friday, European Council President Donald Tusk will meet Irish leader Leo Varadkar in Dublin."
2017-11-30,Police helicopters are taking so long to reach crime scenes that the incident is over before they arrive in more than 40% of cases.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171130202736/https://news.sky.com/story/parts-of-uk-with-quickest-police-helicopter-response-times-revealed-11149762,"On average, more than half of forces had to wait beyond 30 minutes for a helicopter to arrive. A report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services described the National Police Air Service (NPAS) as ""financially unsustainable"" in its current form. HM Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr told Sky News ""some pretty urgent reform is needed"". He said: ""We're not convinced that the way it is operating at the moment and its plans for the future represent the most efficient or the most effective way to provide aviation support to the police."" The long response times have contributed to a 45% decline in the number of hours flown since 2009 - and some officers say this has, in turn, meant an increase in criminals trying to outrun police. The cost of a flying hour has increased from Â£1,335 in 2009 to Â£2,820 in 2016/17. Meanwhile, over the same period, the number of helicopters has decreased from 33 to 19 - with the number of bases dwindling from 31 to 15. Mr Parr said: ""We know policing is under pressure...what I wouldn't want to see if police looking at the costs of calling a helicopter and deciding not to because of increasing costs when actually it's the best thing to do."" He said, however, that ""it would be asking a bit much to draw a link between slightly slower response times and criminals getting away with it"". The five slowest response times in England and Wales: 1. Cumbria: 66 minutes, 33 seconds 2. Dyfed-Powys: 57 minutes, 42 seconds 3. Lincolnshire: 51 minutes, nine seconds 4. West Mercia: 41 minutes, 39 seconds 5. Derbyshire: 41 minutes, 14 seconds The five fastest response times in England and Wales: 1. Metropolitan Police: 10 minutes, 37 seconds 2. Greater Manchester: 16 minutes, 32 seconds 3. Northumbria: 17 minutes, 36 seconds 4. West Yorkshire: 18 minutes, three seconds 5. Cleveland: 18 minutes, 12 seconds"

The 21-year-old, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, but is originally from Chelmsford, Essex, has been charged with assault and theft, despite playing no active role in the 2016 incident, the campaign group said. Ms Hutchinson had been leaving brunch with the group when the altercation occurred. ""The man woke up and began punching the boys,"" she told the campaign group. ""I heard the commotion and came back to see what was going on."" The Swedish man alerted the police and the entire group was arrested and taken to Bur Dubai police station. According to Detained in Dubai, the Swedish man discovered Miss Hutchinson was a UAE resident and transferred charges to her. The rest of the group managed to get their passports back and returned to the UK. Ms Hutchinson told the organisation: ""It is so unfair, I was not involved. ""I just happened to be there, but the police are not interested in anything I have to say. ""Once the man made his complaint it was taken as fact. I can't go to jail, I couldn't cope."" Ms Hutchinson, an account manager for a global transportation company, is being represented by Detained in Dubai, which has helped in legal battles involving other British nationals. Radha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, said: ""In Dubai, if two parties are in dispute or arguing, the first person to speak to the police is usually the one who is believed. ""Often it is a race to get to the police first. By making this complaint, the man may have been safeguarding himself from being charged himself."" She said it was clear Ms Hutchinson was a bystander and was ""being victimised because the alleged culprits have left the country"". A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""Our staff in Dubai assisted a British woman following an incident in 2016, and are ready to provide further help if requested."" In October, Briton Jamie Harron returned home after he was charged with drinking alcohol and accused of putting his hand on another man's hip to avoid spilling a drink in a crowded bar. The 27-year-old electrician was sentenced to three months in jail, having been arrested in July, but an intervention from the UAE's ruler saw him released. In November 2016, a British tourist arrested for having extramarital sex after she claimed she was raped by two men in Dubai had the case against her dropped after investigators decided the act was consensual."

Gallagher, who went to Number 10 for Tony Blair's Cool Britannia reception in 1997, was asked if he had an opinion on Mr Blair's successor-but-one, and on Donald Trump.

She told reporters: ""The fact that we work together, does not mean that we're afraid to say when we think the United States have got it wrong. ""I am very clear that retweeting Britain First was the wrong thing to do."" It came as Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the US, revealed he had made a formal complaint to the White House. Mrs May said at a press conference in Amman, Jordan: ""I'm not a prolific tweeter myself, and that means I don't spend much of my time reading other people's tweets. ""But when I feel there should be a response, I give it - and I've given it."" Her comments are the first direct challenge made to President Trump since a Downing Street statement on Wednesday. It called the sharing of anti-Muslim videos from far-right party Britain First ""wrong"". But the move angered the US leader, who tweeted: ""@Theresa_May, don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!"" On Thursday, Mrs May reiterated the criticism made by Home Secretary Amber Rudd that the original posts were ""wrong"". :: Sad! Pathetic! A history of Donald Trump's Twitter insults:: 'A Trump state visit may now be unthinkable' Asked by Sky News to respond to President Trump's comments about her failure to tackle terrorism at home, Mrs May said: ""We take the need to deal with the terrorist threat very seriously. ""That's about what we do domestically in the United Kingdom, it's about what we do elsewhere in the world."" But she dodged a question on whether the US leader was ""a fit person to meet the Queen"" on a planned state visit. And she avoided answering on whether she would sack a Cabinet minister if they retweeted Britain First material, saying only that she was sure they would not. :: The far-right - what is Britain First? Sky's Jason Farrell said: ""The Prime Minister's comments went down well with Jordanian officials in the room who chuckled at the questions about Donald Trump and applauded Theresa May's rebuke that he 'got it wrong.'"" Sir Kim also said on Thursday: ""British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right, which seek to divide communities and erode decency, tolerance and respect. ""British Muslims are peaceful and law abiding citizens. And I raised these concerns with the White House yesterday."" Following Mr Trump's sharing of videos posted by the Twitter account of Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen on Wednesday, Ms Fransen issued a video statement in which she declared herself ""delighted"" with the President's actions. She also appealed to Mr Trump for his ""help"" and ""intervention"" as she faces a charge of using threatening or abusive language following an appearance at a rally in Belfast this summer. Ms Fransen is due in court next month. Commenting on the developing row on Thursday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I would hope the President will think about this and people who advise the President will advise him. ""Listen, we are a society that wants to be cohesive and inclusive of people and the remarks he makes are just not helpful and not appropriate. ""I think he should stop retweeting what Britain First or any other far-right organisation say."" Mr Corbyn also expressed his belief it is ""unlikely"" Mr Trump's planned state visit to the UK will now go ahead. But he added: ""In the event that he does come to Britain, I hope he will look at the diversity of our society, the sense of inclusivity we have in our society and my local mosque would be very happy to receive him."""

It showed a two point fall in the index to -12 in November, its lowest level since July 2016 and slightly lower than economists' expectations. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said: ""Sadly there's no festive cheer. ""Household jitters following the recent interest rate hike, squeezed incomes, higher inflation and economic uncertainty have dampened the consumer mood across the UK."" Mr Staton said consumers were ""resolutely gloomy"" about the economic outlook and that, despite recent strong retail sales, there had been a sharp drop in the major purchase element of its index. ""This will be an acute concern for retailers as they gear up for the key Christmas selling period,"" he said. Britain's economic growth has slowed this year as higher inflation - largely driven by the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote - has led to households tightening their belts. Some face a further squeeze after the Bank of England earlier this month raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. Last week, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) sharply cut its growth outlook. A separate survey from Lloyds Bank on Wednesday showed business confidence also fell this month, slipping to its lowest level since June 2016. However, figures from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) suggested exporters were enjoying strong sales as they benefited from the weakness of the pound that makes their prices more competitive, as well as stronger demand from the faster-growing economies of the Eurozone. But the BCC also pointed to some exporters suffering from higher raw material costs or staff shortages."

During a trial, called Strive, patients taking Erenumab for six months were compared to others given a placebo. It typically stopped between three and four ""migraine days"" per month. Lead investigator Professor Peter Goadsby, from King's College Hospital, London, told Sky News it is the ""first, migraine-specific preventative drug ever designed for migraine"". It is also a ""big advance"" in being able to treat patients ""more effectively"" and with ""many many less side effects"". ""It's a very big deal in terms of understanding the disorder,"" Professor Goadsby added. He said it could come into general use in the second half of next year. Migraines are believed to affect more than 8.5 million people in the UK each year. The condition is characterised by a throbbing headache, visual disturbances, sensitivity to light and noise and nausea. An attack can last for up to 72 hours. Absenteeism linked to the condition is estimated to cost the UK economy more than Â£2bn a year. ""Migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives,"" said the chief executive of charity Migraine Action, Simon Evans. ""An option that can prevent migraine and that is well tolerated is therefore sorely needed, and we hope that this marks the start of real change in how this condition is treated and perceived."""

It had been loaded into a crate to be banded, and despite being hard at work for five hours, she spotted the ""tattoo"" straight away. The Pepsi devotee, who confesses to drinking up to 12 cans a day, knew the logo well. She told CBC: ""I can't say how he got it on. ""It seemed more like a tattoo or a drawing on the lobster rather than something growing into it."" Ms Lindstrand, as well as her fellow crew and the local Pepsi delivery driver, have spent days coming up with theories on how the marking got there. While some have speculated it may have come from a box or a can, she is not so sure, but can't place exactly what Pepsi product may have caused the mark. She added: ""This tells me there is a lot of garbage in the ocean, if that's what's happening to the lobsters we get out from the water."" Fundy Baykeeper Matthew Abbott, who works for the conservation council, told The Globe and Mail: ""What it really tells us is the prevalence of marine debris in our coastal waters. ""This is a case where the lobster not necessarily has been hurt by it, but it shows that even in the relatively deep waters off Grand Manan there's garbage down there. ""A lot of the plastics we worry about float, but if they're filled with water or other materials they'll sink."" More than eight million tonnes of plastic is thrown away each year and washed out to sea. As it takes centuries to break down, it is being brought back into our food chain as it is eaten by marine creatures."

Acrylamide forms naturally when frying, roasting or baking foods with a high starch content at high temperatures (over 120C). It can be found in a wide range of home-cooked and processed foods, including roasted potatoes and root vegetables, crisps, chips, bread, biscuits, cakes, cereals, coffee and cereal-based baby foods. Dr Lisa Ackerley, food safety adviser at the British Hospitality Association, told Sky News: ""To achieve lower levels of acrylamide, food producers may cook food at a lower temperature but for longer, meaning the colour of food may become lighter. ""Every product is different, and food producers and caterers will be expected to determine the best time and temperature models for them, to ensure they are meeting the lower levels of acrylamide."" The EU's new ""benchmark"" levels for products range from 40 milligrams of acrylamide per kilogram for cereal-based baby food, to 350 for biscuits, 500 for chips and 750 for crisps. The Food Standards Agency has been analysing acrylamide levels in food products for a decade - its latest research covering 269 goods. Analysts found Marks & Spencer's sweet potato, parsnip and beetroot vegetable crisps contained 2,957 milligrams of acrylamide per kilogram - almost four times the EU benchmark level of 750 milligrams of acrylamide per kilogram. Its cranberry and raspberry breakfast biscuits contained 1,683 milligrams of acrylamide per kilogram. This is almost five times the new benchmark, while Fox's Crinkle Crunch contained 1,383 milligrams of acrylamide per kilogram. Waitrose's vegetable crisps were also high in the chemical, containing 1,406 milligrams of acrylamide per kilogram, as were Tyrrell's version at 1,390 milligrams, and Walkers' Original Pops contained 1,133 milligrams of acrylamide per kilogram. The FSA and Food Standards Scotland are working with the BHA and other key organisations to develop simple guidance - to be made available early next year - to help the industry comply with the new rules. Some people vented their frustration on social media at the prospect of some products losing their golden colour. One Twitter user wrote: ""#Brexit can't come soon enough!... Golden brown crisps and biscuits to become paler under #EU food safety crackdown."" Another wrote: ""Because Britain needs more beige food."" Earlier this year, the FSA advised people to only fry, roast, bake or toast starchy food until it is a golden yellow colour."

Shell published the 2017 figures following new laws that came into force earlier this year requiring each company with 250 or more employees to disclose details on its gender pay gap. The FTSE 100 firm employs more than 5,000 people across the UK. It said the fact that it had fewer women in senior leadership roles was one of the key reasons for the gender pay gap. The company also said there were fewer working offshore or in other roles such as trading that attract higher levels of pay. Shell said it was confident that men and women working for it were paid equally for doing jobs of the same value. The company also said that men had traditionally made up the majority of the oil and gas sector workforce. At Shell in the UK, 67% of employees are male and 33% female. It said it was making progress, with the percentage of women in senior management roles rising from 12% in 2005 to 27% this year. At the graduate level, 47% of positions are held by women. Shell UK chair Sinead Lynch said: ""We are already working to bring gender balance to our workforce, and while we have made progress, there is still some way to go."" The figures show that, compared with the midpoint, or median, in the salary range of men at the company, the median pay for women is 23.4% lower. That compares with the 9.1% gap in median earnings across the country reported in the latest Office for National Statistics data. Using a different type of average - the mean, which takes in all pay across the workforce - the gap at Shell UK was 22.2%. Earlier this week, airline easyJet revealed a 45.5% pay gap, blamed on the fact that the vast majority of its pilots are predominantly male, with average salaries nearly four times higher than cabin crew, of whom most are female. The Bank of England said last week that it pays women employees an average of 24% less than men - a gap attributed to the lack of women in senior roles."

We remain open to continuing talks with the RMT."" As well as the strikes, stations across the country are to be hit by engineering works. Great Western Railway will not be operating services in or out of London Paddington from Christmas Eve, and services will be limited on 23 December through to January 2. Southeastern services will be dramatically reduced, with some not running at all for 10 days between 23 December and 1 January. South Western Railway services are running reduced timetables from Christmas Eve. Services between Preston and Lancaster will not run between 24 and 27 December. In Manchester, upgrades by Arriva Trains Wales will affect some lines on 24 December and 30 December through to 1 January.

I don't know where he f****** is."" The youngster, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, was found in a 1.4-metre deep pool at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire in July 2016, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Paul Smith and Charlie's mother Lynsey Dunn of Caledonian, Glascote Heath, deny being grossly negligent. The prosecuting QC, Mary Prior, said Charlie had been supervised by strangers when he was near the water. She told the jury: ""Charlie Dunn drowned in the pool for children at the park known as the Blue Lagoon. ""No one knows how it happened, no one knows why it happened, and at the time he died neither Miss Dunn or Mr Smith have any idea where he was. ""Charlie had been permitted to go off by himself. The prosecution say that Charlie died because he was not supervised by any adult. ""He was left alone in a busy park at five years old in circumstances where there was a clear and obvious risk that he might come to very serious harm leading to his death. ""It will be for you to decide in this case whether that is right."" She said his parents demonstrated an ""ingrained and entrenched indifference"" at the time of the tragedy. ""This case is not about parents turning their back for a minute whilst a tragedy occurs. ""We don't prosecute parents for unavoidable tragedies nor do we expect perfection in parenting. ""This is a gross failure to supervise not for seconds, and not for a few minutes, but for protracted periods of time in circumstances where the child was exposed to danger."" The outdoor pool had signs telling parents that children must be supervised, and was not required to have lifeguards because of its depth. Paramedics tried to save the youngster after they were called to the park, but were unable to. At the time his parents said he had been out of sight for five to 10 minutes, the court heard. Jurors heard the couple had been given a ""warning"" of the dangers of leaving their son unsupervised in the summer of 2015, when a neighbour prevented Charlie, then aged four, from driving a toy car on to a main road. In October 2015, Mrs Prior said, another neighbour had spotted Dunn inside a car - out of sight of her son - when the boy came ""perilously close"" to straying on to a road. It was also alleged that Dunn, 28, and Smith, 36, were berated by a woman during a visit to the water park about two months before Charlie's death. Both defendants are said to have responded that Charlie ""would be all right"". Dunn told police she thought Charlie would have told her if he was intending to go into the water, as he was ""terrified"" of it. Her partner told officers he had been watching Charlie from a distance ""and that if there had been a problem he could have leaped across and got him"". Smith also denies a count of attempting to intimidate a witness. The trial continues."

The drop was sharpest among EU citizens: 230,000 people from the bloc immigrated to the UK from June 2016 to June 2017, down from 284,000. At the same time, the number of EU citizens leaving the UK has increased - up 28,000 to 123,000. From the rest of the world, immigration dropped from 291,000 to 263,000. The figures, published on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics, show that the number of people moving to the UK for a ""definite job"" remained stable. But the amount of people ""looking for work"" plummeted by 43% - down to 74,000. Nicola White, head of migration statistics at the ONS, said: ""These changes suggest that Brexit is likely to be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK - but decisions to migrate are complex and other factors are also going to be influencing the figures."" She added: ""The decline follows historically high levels of immigration and it is too early to say whether this represents a long-term trend."" Earlier this year, Prime Minster Theresa May promised she would stick to her predecessor's target of reducing net migration to under 100,000. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said the net migration fall and rise in confirmed job-seekers highlighted ""that our system is delivering for business needs in (the) UK"". But Professor Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist for the Cabinet Office and senior fellow of the group UK in a Changing Europe, said: ""Whatever your views on the impact of immigration, it cannot be good news that the UK is a less attractive place to live and work, and that we will be poorer as a result. ""If the Government wants to make Brexit a success, it needs to reverse this. ""This means both action now to secure the rights of EU citizens living here, and a clear signal that we will have a liberal and economically-sensible immigration policy post-Brexit.

How will we know what the worst cereal in a Variety Pack is now? @KelloggsUK whatâs this Iâm hearing about you lot getting rid of ricicles . Fuming !! Letâs get these bad boys on eBay.  #Ricicles #FortuneAwaits pic.twitter.com/JVYzewwgLa ""It will also no longer run any children's on-pack promotions on Kellogg's Frosties, in recognition of the fact that this cereal now tends to be eaten by more adults than children in the UK."" Sugar in Coco Pops will be reduced by 40%, following a 14% cut earlier this year, taking it to a 50% reduction between 2017 and 2018. Sugar in Rice Krispies is to come down by 20%, with the Multigrain version getting a 30% cut. The reductions come after a Public Health England report which introduced a broad target for a 20% cut in sugar, particularly in food consumed by children. RIP ricicles, you were twicicles as nicicles. Just logged on to Twitter only to find that Ricicles has died. Another Angel in Heaven tonight. RIP mate, never forgotten. The news that Ricicles would cease production hit cereal fans hard, with many remembering them as a key part of their childhood. One fan said: ""Please don't take ricicles away from me. It was bad enough taking toys out of cereals but no more ricicles is crossing the line."" Others joked that saving the boxes and getting them on eBay would lead them to their fortune. Singer Louis Tomlinson even joined the fight, saying he was ""fuming"" with the decision. The cereal giant also plans to unveil five new vegan and organic cereals, two of which with no added sugar, next year."
2017-11-30,Nineteen schools in Scotland have been closed due to snow as warnings are also issued to commuters in North Yorkshire. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171130202736/https://news.sky.com/story/temperatures-to-plummet-bringing-snow-to-parts-of-uk-11149445,"North Yorkshire has also been affected by snow with local media reporting at least twelve schools are closed. Scarborough College are open but warned pupils it will only have a ""skeleton staff"". North Yorkshire Fire tweeted that drivers should ""drive only if it is necessary"" with some roads congested. Aberdeen Council have released a list for parents of schools closed. The weather warning for the eastern UK said: ""Wintry showers will bring an additional hazard and may lead to 2cm to 5cm of snow accumulating on ground above 100m, primarily over northern Scotland and north-east England. There is also the risk of snow in the East Midlands and East Anglia. Temperatures fell to minus 6C last night in Pershore, Worcestershire, and Thursday will be the coldest day of the week. Forecasters have put out an ice warning for Northern Ireland, southwest England and Wales. Northeastern Scotland and the east coast of England will have rain, sleet and snow. Even when the weather warnings are lifted, snow showers are still expected throughout the day. The Met Office's chief meteorologist, Steve Willington, said: ""Across the UK people will be feeling some pretty raw conditions as we go towards the start of winter, Thursday will feel especially cold with a biting northerly wind. ""Many parts of central Britain will have a very bright week with lots of sunshine. ""However, both east and west coasts will see frequent showers, some of which could be wintry over the hills and maybe down to lower levels by the end of the week in the east. ""This is exactly the sort of weather we would expect to see as we head into the winter months. The weekend looks to be mostly dry although it will be greyer and feeling slightly milder."" There are potential further warnings for Friday, but things are expected to calm down into the weekend. Areas not affected by the warnings, especially away from the coast, will see ""lots of bright, sunny weather"" during the week, the Met Office added. The cold weather is being brought in from the Arctic by an area of low pressure to the east and a ridge of high pressure to the west. Sky News weather presenter Isobel Lang said: ""There'll be more widespread wintry showers across eastern Scotland and eastern England with rain or sleet on the coast but some snow as the showers come inland on the chilly northerly wind. A fresh covering of snow is likely over the hills but only patchy light accumulations at low levels. ""However some places across southeast England, East Anglia and the East Midlands, who haven't seen any snow yet, may well see a little snow later this afternoon and into this evening. ""This cold spell will come to an end this weekend as the winds turn more west to northwesterly drawing slightly milder but cloudier conditions across us with some patchy rain. Nights will also be less frosty as a result."" Older people are being told to take precautions in light of the weather warnings. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""The cold weather is challenging for many older people, particularly if they are coping with ill health or living in housing that costs a lot to heat."" She said the elderly find it harder to adjust to big changes in temperature, with heart attacks and strokes more likely due to the cold raising blood pressure. Breathing in cold air can increase the risk of ""serious illness like flu and pneumonia"", she warned. Ms Abrahams added: ""Simple precautions such as wrapping up warm when going outside, sleeping with the windows closed at night and having plenty of hot food and drinks throughout the day can help keep these risks at bay. ""We would also urge everyone to keep a friendly eye on older relatives, friends and neighbours, especially when the weather is very bad and it's difficult to get out. ""Offering to bring in some shopping, or just popping in for a chat and a cup of tea, can be a real help during the long winter months."""
2017-11-30,A man accused of hacking US government computers faces a wait to find out if he has successfully challenged a ruling that he can be extradited to America.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171130202736/https://news.sky.com/story/alleged-computer-hacker-lauri-love-faces-wait-after-extradition-appeal-11150387,"At a High Court hearing which began on Wednesday, senior judges were told that Lauri Love, who has Asperger syndrome, was at severe risk of committing suicide if extradited. Concluding Thursday's much shorter hearing, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, said he and Mr Justice Ouseley reserved their judgments and would ""take our time"" to consider whether Mr Love, a 32-year-old with autism and depression, should face trial in the US. Their considerations will set the precedent for how courts interpret a legal protection against extradition called the ""forum bar"" which was introduced by Theresa May in 2013 after she blocked the extradition of Gary McKinnon; also an alleged hacker with Asperger syndrome. As the Home Secretary, Mrs May said McKinnon's mental condition meant his transfer to US custody would have been in breach of his human rights - an assessment the forum bar leaves to the judiciary. In September 2016, Mr Love was told by a District Judge that his case did not meet the requirements of the forum bar. That his appeal was heard by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales is significant of the case law which will be established. Mr Love's case forms the first substantive test of the new law, which Mr Alex Bailin QC - intervening for Liberty - told the court seems to have never been used in the four years it has been law. The barristers submitted arguments regarding whether it would be in the interests of justice for Mr Love to be tried in the UK or the US. Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC told the court that Mr Love was not seeking immunity, but that if he was transported to the US there was a significant risk he would not be fit to be tried. ""If [Lauri Love is] dead, putting it bluntly, no victims are going to get any benefit from a trial,"" Mr Fitzgerald told the court. Mr Peter Caldwell QC, representing the US Government at the hearing, said that the forum bar itself wouldn't have prevented extradition in the case of Mr McKinnon. He said that the US was very conscientious towards the suicide risk and was not negligent in that regard. Opening the hearing on Thursday, Mr Fitzgerald submitted to the court that the intention behind the forum bar was to provide judicial protection against the inappropriate extradition of British citizens when a substantial part of their conduct occurred in the UK. Mr Caldwell rose to submit to the court that the UK could seek an undertaking from the US that if Mr Love was found unfit to plead because of the issues cited he could be returned home. The Lord Chief Justice and Mr Fitzgerald rapidly agreed that such an undertaking would occur after the harm caused by extradition had taken effect. The Justices said that judgment had been reserved and would be handed down at a later date, expected to be before the end of February 2018. Outside of the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, Lauri Love's father, the Reverend Alexander Love, said: ""To be born in this country here is to win the lottery of life. ""We believe the justice system here will uphold the appeal. We are trusting in the justice system, and we are trusting in God."" Mr Love himself, wrapped in a thick scarf and woolly hat in the bitter cold, thanked those who attended to offer support and expressed his gratitude for those who have taken an interest in his case."
2017-11-30,"Following her engagement to Prince Harry, the Royal Family have announced that Meghan Markle intends to become a UK citizen.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171130202736/https://news.sky.com/story/becoming-a-brit-what-will-meghan-markle-have-to-do-to-get-uk-citizenship-11147904,"But it requires more than just getting married. For most newlyweds it is a process that takes years, a series of different visas, and tests and checks that can be fiendishly tough. If Ms Markle is following the same process as most non-EEA nationals, marrying Harry will not mean an automatic UK passport: she'll need to apply for a fiancee or spouse visa. :: Harry and Meghan reveal their wedding venue To be granted that, she must meet a range of ""suitability"" criteria, as well as vouching that her and Harry are the real deal, showing they intend to live permanently together in the UK and have a ""genuine relationship"". While Monday's interview has convinced the nation of the couple's affections, some applicants face being quizzed by immigration officers, or providing personal information such as messages and photographs. The betrothed must also meet a minimum income rule, which stipulates that a Briton must earn at least Â£18,600 a year - or have savings equivalent to Â£62,500 - to bring their partner to the UK. The fortunes of both Meghan and Harry mean that's not a problem. But the requirement has also been criticised because around 40% of workers in the UK earn less than the threshold. Furthermore, it is thousands higher for people with children, meaning it can result in families being separated. ""It's designed to test people on modest incomes, and people on low incomes obviously won't satisfy that,"" immigration barrister Adrian Berry told Sky News. Partners also need to show they can support their spouse ""without recourse to public funds"", and show evidence they have suitable accommodation that is not overcrowded or dangerous. Luckily for Meghan and Harry, the Royal Family's income is not classed as public funds. Whether he will have to present a tenancy agreement for Nottingham Cottage is unclear. When these criteria are met, it is possible for the non-EEA national to live legally in the UK. But citizenship is still many years away. If the normal rules are in place, Ms Markle can only apply for citizenship after she has had three years of lawful residence in the UK, with indefinite leave to remain. But indefinite leave takes five years to acquire - demanding two separate visas each lasting two and a half years. The cost of this? At the moment it's around Â£7,000 in fees and processing. But as the bill to the Home Office is increasing by 20% each year it will be more expensive when Ms Markle has reached the end of the process. That's not the end of the process though. To have the status approved there are a few more hoops to jump through - not least the notorious life in the UK citizenship test, requiring the applicant to swot up on about 3,000 facts and 278 historical dates. Ms Markle, who in an interview last year failed to recognise Cockney rhyming slang, may have some revision to do. If that all sounds like too much hard work, there may be a 'get-out clause' for the future royal. ""In exceptional cases they don't have to apply the rules as they do generally,"" immigration expert Mr Berry said. ""And I imagine this may be a case that they judge exceptional""."
2017-11-30,"The father of a toddler who died after sustaining serious injuries called the little girl a ""bully"" as he cried at her inquest.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171130202736/https://news.sky.com/story/poppi-worthington-father-calls-13-month-old-a-bully-as-he-gives-evidence-11150461,"Paul Worthington gave evidence at the second inquest into the death of Poppi Worthington, who was found with serious injuries in her home in Barrow-in-Furness and died in hospital on 12 December, 2012. An inquest was held in 2014, during which a coroner decided he was satisfied to rely on the findings of a private family court judgment and declared Poppi's death as unexplained. However, a family court judge later ruled the child had probably been sexually assaulted by her father before her death. Mr Worthington returned to court on Thursday to give evidence, but answered many questions by referring to his statement of 2014. Poppi's DNA was found on a swab of Mr Worthington's penis. When questioned, he referred to previous statements, which had offered the explanation that he had put his fingers in Poppi's mouth to clear her airway and had later urinated. He also referred to his daughter, who was 13-months-old when she died, as a ""bully"". When asked to describe Poppi, the 49-year-old said: ""Lively. Bubbly. The happy one out of the siblings. Bully in her own little way."" :: Poppi Worthington: Sister says she trusted baby's father with her own children During Thursday's hearing, he refused to answer all but one of the questions put to him - and simply referred to his previous statements under Rule 22 a total of 183 times. The inquest was told the post-mortem examination of the toddler showed penetration of the anus. When Mr Worthington was asked if he at any point penetrated her, he replied: ""I refer to my previous statements under Rule 22."" He told the court he didn't know how her bottle or pillow got onto the double bed where he usually slept. After completing the questioning, coroner David Roberts said: ""Now you are perfectly entitled to rely on your legal right not to answer anything that might incriminate you, there's no inference drawn from that. ""That said, today is an opportunity for you to tell me anything you think may help me understand how Poppi came by her death. ""So I don't want you to leave court thinking you have not had the opportunity to tell me what happened as best you can remember about the facts of those hours. ""It's an opportunity. Is there anything else you would like to tell me?"" Mr Worthington replied: ""No sir."" :: Father of Poppi Worthington refused to answer questions 69 times at inquest The inquest also heard from two police officers who attended Poppi's home, including one who found ""kitchen roll"" when asked to look for nappies. Former Detective Constable Lindsey Bolton, who is no longer a serving police officer, said the laptop used by Mr Worthington to watch pornography the night that Poppi died was never recovered by officers. He sold the device after her death. Detective Sergeant John Carton told the inquest when he went to see Poppi there had been no visible bruising, but there was blood around the backside and in her nappy. He said there has been no effort to remove the sheet she had been lying on, or the laptop, because it wasn't a criminal investigation at the time. Mr Carton told the inquest a doctor he spoke to was concerned by Mr Worthington's ""changing story"". Closing evidence, DI Amanda Sadler said she should have taken samples from Poppi and regretted not taking a DNA sample from Mr Worthington earlier."
2017-11-30,A serial sex attacker who targets young females during rush hour is thought to have assaulted his 25th victim.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20171130202736/https://news.sky.com/story/police-appeal-after-serial-rush-hour-sex-attacker-targets-25th-victim-11150008,"Detectives believe a white man, in his 40s with blue eyes, has carried out all the attacks over the past year. The majority of his victims are girls, with the youngest aged eight, and the rest are young women. All were attacked during the morning or afternoon rush hours in south London. Police have released CCTV footage of the suspect, which shows him running and walking near the scene of the latest attack on a 15-year-old girl in Sandbourne Road, Brockley, just after 8.30 am on 22 November. In the video he appears to be slim with greyish hair and is wearing a dark coat and blue trousers or jeans. Last month Sky News showed images of the man before and after an attack on a 25-year-old woman in Liskaerd Gardens, Kidbrooke. At the time it was revealed he was suspected to have attacked three 11-year-olds in the south London areas of Grove Park, Lee and Forest Hill. :: Police hunt suspected serial child sex offender in Greenwich and Lewisham Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Furphy of the Metropolitan Police said: ""These offences have been traumatic for the victims, all of whom have been young females going about their daily lives. ""There is a strong possibility that these incidents are part of a linked series of attacks as a number of victims have provided very similar descriptions of the attacker - a white man aged between 40 and 50. ""Our officers have been working tirelessly to apprehend the suspect, but we need the public's help. ""CCTV shows footage of a male that we would like to speak to who we believe may be able to assist our investigation. If this is you or if you know who this person is, please contact us."" Police believe there may be more victims who have not reported attacks and are urging them to do so. The first attack is thought to have been on a 13-year-old girl in Orpington in October last year. Most of the assaults have happened in the boroughs of Lewisham and Greenwich, but there have been others in Southwark, Bromley and Bexley. Police said they had increased patrols in those areas and were advising schools and community groups. Anyone with information is asked to call police or ring Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. :: The full list of alleged attacks that are thought to have been carried out by the same man took place: At 9.15am on Thursday 6 October 2016 in Foxfield Road, Orpington BR8 [victim aged 13] - Bromley borough At 4.30pm on Friday 28 April 2017 in Heathfield Lane, Chislehurst BR7 [victim aged 13] - Bromley At around 7.50am-8.20am on Thursday 8 June in St Thomas Drive Orpington BR5 [victim aged 15] - Bromley At 2.55pm on Wednesday 21 June in Springfield Grove SE7 [victim aged 18] - Greenwich At 4.30pm on Wednesday 21 June in Heavitree Road SE18 [victim aged 16] - Greenwich At 5pm on Wednesday 21 June in Lovel Avenue DA16 [victim aged 13] - Bexley At 5.30pm on Wednesday 21 June in Plumstead Adventure Play Ground SE18 [victim aged 19] - Greenwich At 8.20am on Friday, 30 June in Ravens Way, SE12 [victim aged 13] - Lewisham At 5.20pm on Thursday 27 July in Falmouth Road SE1 [victim aged 19] - Southwark At 8.50am on Monday 14 August in Kitto Road, Se14, [victim aged 27] - Lewisham At 12.14pm on Friday 25 August in Green Chain walk, near Portland Rd, BR1 [victim aged 35] - Bromley At around 1.14pm on Tuesday 29 August in Edward Tyler Road, SE12 [victim aged 11] - Lewisham At 4.30pm on Thursday 7 September in Thicket Road SE20 [victim aged 28] - Bromley At 5.20pm on Monday 18 September in Half Moon Lane SE24 [victim aged 11] - Southwark At 8.20am on Wednesday, 27 September in Vicars Hill, SE13 [victim aged 13] - Lewisham At 4.30pm on Thursday, 28 September in Frank Burton Close, SE7 [victim aged 13] - Greenwich At around 8.15am on Thursday, 28 September in Alanthus Close, SE12 [victim aged 11] - Lewisham At 9.20am on Thursday, 5 October in Kidbrooke Park Road, SE3 [victim aged 13] - Greenwich At 9.30am on Thursday, 5 October in Kidbrooke Park Road SE3 [victim aged 27] - Greenwich At around 9.54am on Thursday 5 October in Liskeard Gardens, SE3 [victim aged 25] - Lewisham At 4am on Monday, 16 October in Honor Oak Road, SE23 [victim aged 11] - Lewisham At 4.45pm on Thursday 19 October in Winn Common, SE18 [victim aged 14] - Greenwich At Around 8.20am-8.50am on Monday 13 November in Vulcan Terrace SE4 [victim aged 8] - Lewisham At 7.30am on Tuesday 21 November in Middle Park Avenue SE9 [victim aged 12] - Bromley At 8.30am on Wednesday 22 November in Sandbourne Road SE4 [victim aged 15] - Lewisham"

Britain First was formed in 2011 by former members of the British National Party and actively campaigns against multiculturalism and the ""Islamisation"" of the UK. It is widely condemned as racist. It is led by former BNP councillor Paul Golding and former English Defence League member Jayda Fransen. The group conducted ""Christian patrols"" in Tower Hamlets, east London, in February 2014. Activists filmed themselves holding a banner stating ""We Are The British Resistance"" and emptying beer cans outside a mosque. In May 2014, Britain First invaded ten mosques in Bradford, along with others in Glasgow, Luton and east London. In July 2014, members of the group entered the Crayford Mosque in south London, demanding that its segregated entrances be removed. Both Golding and Ms Fransen were charged with causing religiously aggravated harassment in September 2017 in relation to leaflets distributed in Thanet and Canterbury. Golding was also jailed for eight weeks in December 2016 for breaking a court order banning him from entering mosques. 2014 European elections - Candidates stood in Wales and Scotland. The party failed to win any seats, finishing 8th of 11 in Wales with 6,633 votes and 7th of nine in Scotland with 13,639 votes. During the campaign it used the phrase ""Remember Lee Rigby"" - a reference to the fusilier killed in 2013 in London - which was widely condemned. 2014 Rochester and Strood by-election - Fransen stood as a candidate. She lost her deposit, winning only 56 votes. The seat was won by UKIP. Royal Mail had refused to deliver a leaflet for the party during the by-election, claiming its contents were illegal. 2016 London mayor election - Golding stood as the Britain First candidate, but won only 1.2% of the votes (31,372). He was pictured at the count turning his back on Labour's winning candidate Sadiq Khan. Britain First was deregistered by the Electoral Commission in November after failing to confirm its registered details and pay a Â£25 fee. That means it cannot now place candidates on ballot papers under the name Britain First. The group has a number of policies centred around immigration and the maintenance of British national sovereignty. They include:"
