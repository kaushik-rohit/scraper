2017-06-02,"The boss of Marks and Spencer has told Sky News that it needs to do ""a better job of listening to customers"" and to focus its clothing range on wardrobe essentials rather than trying to follow cutting-edge fashion.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/ms-chief-admits-focus-on-fast-fashion-wrong-10901147,"Steve Rowe was appointed chief executive at the start of last year and has overseen a significant and expensive restructuring programme. Last week, he unveiled a set of financial results that showed pre-tax profit falling by nearly two-thirds. Like-for-like sales also dropped. But behind the scenes, M&S is undergoing a big transformation. Mr Rowe has spent money on closing overseas stores and also on curtailing the number of online sales. He's changing the company's approach to clothing, an area where it has struggled badly in recent years. And on Thursday, he launched a new programme of community projects, designed to bring the company closer to its customers and to reinforce its credentials as an ethical powerhouse. Mr Rowe made his name running the food division of the company, which has done notably well in recent times. His challenge now is clearly to transfer that success into clothing, which has sometimes seemed to be withering in the face of competition from the likes of Zara, Top Shop, Primark and supermarkets on the high street, as well as online retailers such as ASOS and Boohoo. So, I asked Mr Rowe, if M&S had made a mistake in trying to get to the cutting edge of fashion, rather than concentrating on everyday wardrobes. ""Yes I think we did go a little bit too far,"" he said. ""Our customers tell us they want us to interpret fashion and turn it into contemporary, stylish clothes. ""They want us to build them great wardrobe essentials. We haven't done enough of that, so the emphasis in our buying department is now on improving those products, with better quality and better ranges. You'll see more and more of that."" The admission that the focus on high fashion was wrong is not the only error that Mr Rowe has identified from the company's recent past. ""We had a lot of interaction with customers, but sometimes we haven't used that interaction as well as we should have done,"" he told me. ""We've talked to three million people and analysed five million baskets, and we're continuing that dialogue every day. ""Customer satisfaction scores are up, we're listening to our customers, and the clothing business is recovering."" There is a strong sense that, after a year in the job, Mr Rowe is keen to differentiate himself from the previous management. Under the stewardship of Marc Bolland, Marks and Spencer placed a focus on a programme called Plan A, which became synonymous with worldwide environmental programmes. While Mr Rowe maintains those aims are still being pursued, Thursday's launch was all about helping local communities with projects such as career advice, support for mental health issues and childcare. ""It's about engaging with customers to help them to have a healthier environment, in every way. ""Customers care about this - they want to engage with companies who show social responsibility, who have integrity and are engaged in the local community. And a thriving local community is good for business.""Mr Rowe said that he did sense ""growing concerns"" in his customers about the state of the economy, but also said that one of the effects of Brexit would be to make the company consider sourcing more products from UK providers. He also told me that the company would be making ""less and less fast fashion"" and instead concentrating on garments that are ""made to last"". ""The Marks and Spencer story is not about what's going on outside at the moment, it's a self-help story,"" he said. ""We've got lots to do. It's not finished, but it is under our control."""
2017-06-02,Theresa May is working towards hitting her manifesto target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands by the end of the next Parliament.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/pm-stands-firm-behind-ten-of-thousands-migration-pledge-10901623,"On the campaign trail across target seats in the North East, West Yorkshire and Derbyshire, the Prime Minister insisted it was right to ""work for those sustainable levels"", despite repeatedly missing the target as home secretary. Brandon Lewis, the police minister, said on Thursday that the Conservatives wanted to see migration levels come down to the tens of thousands over the next Parliament. And the Prime Minister rode in behind her minister, confirming: ""That's what we're working for."" Addressing workers at a furniture factory in Pontefract, the Prime Minister told Sky News that she was determined to tackle immigration levels, despite warnings from think tanks on the economic fallout of cutting migration to the UK. ""The reason why we want to bring net migration down to sustainable levels of the tens of thousands is because of the impact that immigration has when it's too fast and too high and uncontrolled on people - and it does have an impact on people particularly on the lower end of the income scale,"" she said. ""We believe it is right to work for those sustainable levels, but what I've always said, and what I've made clear in the manifesto, is you need to work consistently on this. ""There's no single thing you can do that suddenly creates that particular set of numbers, you're constantly having to work at it to look at all parts of it."" Reducing UK immigration to the levels promised by Mrs May will damage the economy, according to a report released last week. The Centre of Economics and Business Research concluded that a rapid reduction in net migration to below 100,000 a year could reduce the potential size of the economy by between 1.5 and 3% by 2025. The Office of Budget Responsibility last year estimated that a 80,000 drop in annual net migration would increase net borrowing by £6bn a year. This is because migrants tend to be working and contribute more to the British coffers than they take out in benefits and public spending. But Conservatives believe that Mrs May's tough talk on immigration will play well in working class areas that voted to leave the EU in last year's referendum. In the final week of campaigning, the Prime Minister made three pit stops across the North East to the East Midlands as she sought to reboot her faltering election campaign by getting back to Brexit basics in Labour's Vote Leave heartlands. The Prime Minister pledged to embrace the ""promise of Brexit"" as she insisted she could make a success of leaving the EU and build a ""brighter future"" for Britain in a tour of traditional Labour seats that voted to leave the EU. Mrs May is hoping that her Brexit message will encourage UKIP and Labour supporters to switch sides, with the Tories targeting seats where attracting support from former Ukippers could tip them over the winning line. One example from her tour was Middlesbrough and East Cleveland, where the Tories are chasing a Labour majority of 2,268 and the UKIP vote stood at 6,935 in 2015. The singular focus back on Brexit comes after a difficult couple of weeks for the Prime Minister, with Jeremy Corbyn gaining ground on her. She called the snap election to ""strengthen her hand"" in the Brexit negotiations by increasing her Commons majority of 17. But her misstep over a plan to make middle England pay more for their social care - a pledge she was forced to u-turn on just days later - has left her on the back foot."
2017-06-02,"Millions of people are set to see their annual insurance bill go up as a tax hike comes into force from Thursday, the industry has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/millions-of-homes-face-rise-in-insurance-costs-due-to-tax-hike-insurers-warn-10900290,"The cost to cover cars, homes, pet and health insurance are all affected with the rate of insurance premium tax (IPT) increasing from 10% to 12%. It means the rate of tax paid on most insurance policies has doubled in less than two years, up from 6% in 2015. The increase could add an extra £47 to the average household's annual general insurance bill, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which represents insurance firms. The British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) said it is concerned pricier policies will lead to more people going without or reducing their cover. It estimates the tax rise will affect 20.4 million homeowners/renters with contents insurance, 20.1 million motorists, 3.2 million homeowners with mortgage protection, 1.9 million people with private medical insurance and 3.4 million pet owners. Those who already pay more for their insurance face the heaviest burden, such as young drivers and households in flood risk areas, it said. Businesses who take out commercial insurance could also face a considerable increase to their costs. Steve White, chief executive of BIBA, said: ""This rapid increase is unprecedented - between 1997 and 2015, a period of 18 years, there were only two rate rises, taking the rate from 4% to 6%."" He called for a freeze on the tax to be imposed for the term of the next Parliament. The latest IPT rise comes after figures revealed that inflation hit its highest level in nearly four years - 2.7% - in April. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""Insurance premium tax is a tax on insurers, not consumers - insurance firms decide whether to pass it on to their customers or not. ""IPT is higher in several European countries, including France and Germany, than it is in the UK."""
2017-06-02,"An unqualified nanny has been convicted of killing a 10-month-old baby after losing her temper and violently shaking him in a moment of ""madness"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/nanny-viktoria-tautz-guilty-of-shaking-10-month-old-baby-boy-to-death-10901081,"Joshua Paul had been in the care of 34-year-old Viktoria Tautz when he collapsed at his parents' home in Haringey, north London, before being taken to hospital. The infant died three days later. Tautz, 34, has been jailed for four years at the Old Bailey. She had denied manslaughter and said she never got ""angry"" or ""frustrated"" with the baby, who was born 10 weeks early. But the prosecution said she had ""snapped"" and caused his catastrophic brain and spinal injuries through ""dangerous and excessive shaking"". Zoe Johnson QC rejected the suggestion Joshua was hurt in a ""horsey game"", as head wobbling would have been ""nowhere near enough"" to kill him. The jury deliberated for nearly seven hours before convicting her in a majority decision. Bernard Richmond QC, defending, told the court Tautz was paid only £3.60 an hour and lacked ""resilience"". He said: ""She was a young woman with a very limited amount of training with a baby who had obviously very difficult needs. ""She was not fully qualified and ultimately her pay reflected her degree of training."" Tautz collapsed in tears in the dock as she was sentenced by Mrs Justice McGowan. The judge said: ""You were not in the same position as a teenage mother in the middle of the night on her own trapped in a flat without anyone to help her."" Tautz began working for the family on 16 June, 2014, after the boy's mother Pearl Paul returned to work. In a statement read in court, Ms Paul said her son was happy with Tautz and that she ""never saw her lose her temper"". Ms Paul left her son ""happy and playing"" with Tautz at around 8.40am on 29 August in the one-bedroom flat. At 9.07am, a neighbour called 999 after Tautz ran from the flat shouting for help, holding Joshua who was unconscious. Doctors found he had suffered a devastating and ""irrecoverable"" brain injury and he died at Great Ormond Street Hospital on 1 September. Giving evidence through a Hungarian interpreter, Tautz, of Barnet, told jurors she picked the little boy up from his cot because he was crying ""very intensively"" and his face was red and swollen. Joshua then appeared to be choking and Tautz rushed into the bathroom and tried to make him vomit. When that did not work she ran outside to get help. She denied shaking Joshua in an attempt to revive him. The boy's parents did not want to make a victim impact statement. An NSPCC spokeswoman said: ""Tautz inflicted appalling injuries on a 10-month-old baby she had been trusted to look after. ""Instead of caring for him and keeping him safe, her actions have robbed a vulnerable young child of his life."""
2017-06-02,A noisy and ill-tempered TV election debate began and ended with Jeremy Corbyn and the UK's minor parties condemning Theresa May for failing to turn up.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-slammed-for-no-show-in-noisy-and-ill-tempered-debate-10900154,"In a seven-way debate, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd stood in for the Prime Minister and was attacked over the Government's record in office in a 90-minute showdown that was at times a shouting match. Several times, BBC presenter Mishal Hussein, who was chairing the debate, struggled to be heard above the squabbling among the politicians taking part. It was the clashes between Mr Corbyn - who only announced hours before the debate that he would take part - and Ms Rudd that were the most heated during the debate, with angry disagreements on the economy, Brexit, immigration and terrorism. They were joined in the debate in Cambridge by the Lib Dems' Tim Farron, SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson, Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas and the UKIP leader Paul Nuttall. And although there was no clear winner among the bickering, Ms Rudd's combative performance will have boosted her chances of becoming the next Tory Chancellor and a future leader of the party. In her closing remarks at the end of the debate, she said: ""You heard the squabbling and discord of disagreement tonight. You saw the coalition of chaos in action."" It is reported that Ms Rudd took part in the debate just two days after the death of her elderly father on Monday and insisted on taking her place regardless. After the debate, Labour claimed Mr Corbyn won the debate. The party said: ""He showed himself as a leader who wants to change the country for the better, to make it work for the many not just a few. By contrast, Theresa May's refusal to take part showed her weakness."" During the debate Mr Corbyn said there was ""nothing remotely strong or stable"" about the Tories' record in office and claimed they would bring in five more years of cuts to public services if re-elected. But in one of many bitter clashes between the Labour leader and the Home Secretary, a punchy Ms Rudd hit back: ""The only question to consider is who should be in No 10 to steer Britain to a brighter future? ""Jeremy Corbyn with his money tree, wish list manifesto and no plan for Brexit or Theresa May with her record of delivery."" An angry Mr Corbyn was then applauded when he immediately shot back at her: ""Have you been to a food bank? Have you seen people sleeping around our stations? ""Have you seen the levels of poverty that exist because of your government's conscious decisions on benefits?"" Then the Home Secretary faced groans from the audience as she defended the Tory record on welfare, insisting: ""We are a party who will always support those in most need."" And attacking Mr Corbyn again, she said: ""I know there is no extra payment you don't want to add to, no tax you don't want to rise. We have to stop thinking, as you do, that there is a magic money tree."" She added: ""It's as though he thinks it's some sort of game - a game of Monopoly perhaps where you ask the banker for the red money to pay electrics, the green money to buy the railways and the yellow money to buy the gasworks,"" she said. ""It's not like that. This is people's hard-earned money. We will protect that. We won't roll the dice."" Ms Lucas, who performed strongly throughout, said Ms Rudd's response on disability benefits was ""downright insulting"". Mr Nuttall, answering a question on immigration, said current levels were ""unsustainable"" and that UKIP would take action to bring the numbers coming into the country under control. ""We would do it by having an Australian-style points system so that if you've got the skills this country needs, yes, please come here and work, but beyond that we have to get the population under control,"" he said. Mr Farron accused the Conservatives of running an immigration policy to ""appease UKIP"", and drew applause when he highlighted the case of an Asian doctor who was spat at and abused as he returned home after treating the injured in the Manchester bomb attack. ""That is what happens if you demonise immigrants,"" he said. ""Do we need, as I'm afraid the Prime Minister has done for the last seven years, to set completely barmy, bogus targets that she fails to meet every year. No we don't."" It was Mr Robertson who led the attack on the Conservatives on their manifesto policies on social care and the winter fuel payment, demanding answers on who would lose out from the ""dementia tax"". He challenged her: ""I think those people deserve to know by how much they will lose out. The Prime Minister didn't have the guts to come along this evening to tell us."" At that point the Home Secretary was laughed at by the audience as she called for people to ""judge us on our record"" on the public finances. ""We have cut the deficit, we have reduced taxes for the lowest paid and we have made sure that we have continued to invest in the NHS, which is getting another £8bn a year by the end of this parliament,"" she said. But the only way to have the money to invest was through having a strong economy ""which does sometimes mean making difficult choices, those sorts of choices no other party here is prepared to face up to"". Ms Rudd said the plans would mean winter fuel payments will not be paid to millionaires but would not give specific figures. She added: ""We will always look after pensioners, ensuring they have dignity and security in retirement."" Mr Corbyn was forced to defend his speech last Friday linking UK foreign policy to terrorism at home, claiming British military intervention in countries such as Libya had left ""ungoverned spaces"" which the extremists had been able to exploit to mount attacks. ""If you intervene somewhere, the consequences go on for a very long time,"" he said. ""It would be extremely unwise for any government anywhere in the world to ignore what is happening in Libya, where large areas are left ungoverned and very dangerous forces are arising there."" But the Home Secretary hit back: ""I am shocked that Jeremy Corbyn just in 2011 boasted that he had opposed every piece of anti-terror legislation in his 30 years in office. I really think he must be held accountable for that because I find it chilling."" Mr Corbyn responded that Mrs May and other senior Conservatives had voted against anti-terror laws in 2005. ""My opposition to anti-terror legislation isn't opposition to protecting us from terrorism. It is simply saying there must be judicial oversight over what is done in our name,"" he said. As the debate drew to a close, Mr Nuttall concluded by boasting: ""We have been proven right on Brexit, proved right on immigration, proved right on grammar schools, proved right on protecting our police and security services."" Ms Lucas, in her closing remarks, said Britain was at a crossroads between tolerance and openness or turning inwards towards ""isolation and hate"". But the most powerful finale came from Mr Farron, who won loud applause when he said: ""You're not worth Theresa May's time. Don't give her yours."""
2017-06-02,Jeremy Corbyn is promising to create a million good-quality jobs if he wins the General Election next week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-pledges-to-create-one-million-decent-jobs-10901401,"The Labour leader will offer to give people ""pride and purpose"" in a speech in York later, as he pledges to pump £250bn into industry. The party that promises to scrap zero-hours contracts is suggesting it will not only create employment, but jobs with higher wages. Labour says the money will come through a new National Investment Bank and a network of Regional Development Banks and a National Transformation Fund. But Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that Labour would destroy jobs by raising taxes and increasing borrowing. Mr Corbyn's speech aims to redirect the election debate onto domestic policy, after a day when both the main parties focused on Brexit. :: Corbyn vows to meet Merkel 'straight away' He will argue that years of Conservative rule has resulted in stagnating productivity, falling public sector net investment and average wages forecast to be lower in real terms in 2021/22 than their 2007/08 level. Mr Corbyn will say: ""When Labour talks about job creation we mean decent jobs, jobs which pay a real living wage, which people can get by on, and which give people a sense of pride and purpose. ""Labour will invest to drive growth across the whole of Britain, creating wealth which is shared across our country, rather than concentrated in the hands of the few. ""Labour will ensure people are not held back. We will build an economy where everyone shares in the creation of wealth as well as its distribution. ""Under the Conservatives, the richest have got richer, while most people's incomes have fallen or stagnated. ""Labour's plans will make sure everyone shares in our country's wealth."" But Mr Hammond responded by saying: ""Jeremy Corbyn will not create jobs, he will destroy them. ""His reckless plans for higher taxes and more borrowing will wreck the economy and we will all pay the price. ""We have made real progress in fixing the mess we inherited from Labour, helping businesses create 2.9 million more jobs so there are a record number of people in work."" The Conservatives claim Labour's plans to reverse reductions in corporation tax will discourage investment, which is crucial to supporting growth and jobs. They warn this could add additional instability as the UK enters Brexit negotiations. Mr Hammond added: ""With Theresa May as Prime Minister providing strong leadership, we can lock in that progress and deliver on her plan for Brexit to create a stronger, more prosperous Britain. ""But all of this is at risk if Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister, negotiating Brexit at the head of a coalition of chaos - and it only takes a loss of six seats for Theresa May for that to happen."""

The attack was initially feared to be an act of terrorism, with security forces currently battling Islamic State militants in the south of the country. The group was quick to claim that its ""lone wolf soldiers"" had carried out the assault. The gunman initially managed to get away, with police saying he could have been helped by that fact smoke had obscured CCTV cameras. US President Donald Trump said he was monitoring the ""terrorist"" attack. However, Manila's chief of police, Oscar Albayalde, later ruled out a terror motive and revealed that the gunman had killed himself. ""It's either he lost in the casino and wanted to recoup his losses or he went totally nuts,"" said Mr Albayalde. Police said the gunman had gone into a room at the Maxims hotel, which is connected to the casino, and set himself on fire on the bed. A bag of gambling chips worth around £175,000 was found in the toilet. Philippines national police chief Ronald dela Rosa described the man as ""white with a moustache"". Mr dela Rosa told local media that the lone gunman had not shot at people but instead headed straight towards the room where the gambling chips were kept. ""We cannot attribute this to terrorism,"" said Mr dela Rosa. ""We are looking into a robbery angle because he did not hurt any people and went straight to the casino chips storage room."" A guard was shot in the attack but survived and about 70 others suffered mainly minor injuries as they ran to escape. ""I live right behind Resorts World... and you can see the smoke and hear gunshots and people are shouting at each other,"" one witness said in a video posted on Facebook during the attack. The complex includes four hotels, casinos, a shopping centre, cinemas, restaurants, clubs and a theatre. The Philippines has been on heightened alert amid a crisis in the south of the country, where militant violence has left at least 171 people dead.

Goodyear led tributes to him, saying she was ""devastated"". ""I will treasure all the happy times we had working and laughing together. We were just like a married couple - crazy, I know, but true,"" she said. ""Rest in peace, Roy. I will always love you."" Barraclough was also well known for his collaboration with comedian Les Dawson, who died in 1993. The pair went on to create some of the nation's favourite sketches, including gossipy housewives Cissie and Ada. Dawson's daughter Charlotte posted a tribute on Twitter: ""Omg I'm devastated ... at least you get to be reunited with my daddy."" Barraclough started his career as a comedian and pianist at a holiday camp on the Isle of Wight, before joining the Huddersfield Repertory Company.

A Ticketmaster spokesperson said: ""Sadly, over 10,000 unscrupulous applications have been made.""

2017-06-02,Rumours have reignited of a possible Oasis reunion at Ariana Grande's Manchester benefit concert this weekend.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/should-oasis-fans-expect-a-manchester-gig-reunion-for-liam-and-noel-10900412,"But could it really happen? A reunion was first hoped for on Tuesday, when Liam Gallagher played his debut solo show at Manchester's O2 Ritz two days after sending big brother Noel an unexpected birthday message. ""Happy 50th rkid stay young LG x,"" he wrote on Twitter, leaving fans wondering if the two Manchester siblings could finally be burying the hatch. But Noel did not show up at the O2, and Liam later said of his tweet that he simply wanted to remind fans his brother is ""an old fart now"". ""I just woke up, you know with all the stuff that went on in Manchester, I woke up and I just thought: you know what? You know I'm going there. Happy Birthday. ""And plus, I wanted to remind everyone he's an old fart now. You know, the old 1.6 million followers. There were people going, like: 'What? he's 50?' I was, like: 'Indeed. Yes he is.'"" But Liam later added, in a more sombre tone, that ""as much as we get into all the tittle and tattle and that"", ""he's my brother, man, and I love him"". Now, with Ariana Grande returning to Manchester a fortnight after the bombing which killed 22 people at the Manchester Arena, the rumours have started again. Stars including Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Usher, Take That, Pharrell Williams, Miley Cyrus and Niall Horan are already confirmed to play. Noel has been asked by organisers of the One Love Manchester benefit to play Oasis hit Don't Look Back In Anger with Coldplay's Chris Martin. ""It would be a fitting highlight to celebrate the resilience and unity of this great city,"" organisers said. Although there has yet been no confirmation of any Gallagher appearance, fans say the gig could be the perfect opportunity for the brothers to put their feud behind them. The first signs of trouble were seen following a Los Angeles gig in 1994, and the next 15 years were shadowed by breakups and fights until Oasis broke up for good in 2009. Speculation of a reunion was fuelled when Black Eyed Peas singer Taboo shared a tweet on Wednesday, listing Oasis in the line-up to the tribute show. He later pulled the post and replaced it with a new one excluding Oasis, and apologised for the confusion. My bad folks on original post - human error There has also been speculation about whether the longed-for reunion could happen at Glastonbury, where Noel will present the Supersonic Oasis documentary and Liam is tipped to fill a TBA slot on the same day. But organisers have said it is more likely the two will be kept apart, and Liam, when asked about a possible reunion on Radio 1 on Wednesday, said it would not be happening. ""No, it ain't. Everyone knows I love our kid. He doesn't speak to me, we don't speak to each other. I'll speak to him some day. It's all very sad, but we'll get over it,"" he said. ""Mate, if we ever got back together, it would be happening. There'd be no dodgy gigs, it'd be bang on. So there is unfinished business there, but we'll see what happens.

2017-06-02,Labour has said it will try to implement its programme as a minority government if it is the largest party in a hung parliament after the election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-would-try-to-form-minority-government-if-it-is-largest-party-10901127,"Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the party would not seek to enter into a coalition with other parties, but would present a Queen's Speech and Budget. This high stakes move would effectively challenge other ""progressive"" parties to back Jeremy Corbyn's party or risk a return to Conservative rule. Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly claimed that a vote for Mr Corbyn in next week's General Election would result in a ""coalition of chaos"" with Labour propped up by MPs from parties like the Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party or Greens. The possibility of a hung parliament has emerged in recent days as the opinion polls show a narrowing of the Conservatives' lead. A new survey by YouGov for The Times suggests Labour is just three points behind, a gap that could result in no party having a majority. Answering questions after a speech by Mr Corbyn in Basildon, Essex, Ms Thornberry was asked whether Labour would be ready to do a coalition deal - or even try to persuade MPs from Sinn Fein to attend the House of Commons in order to support them. She replied: ""The truth is we are fighting to win and we are fighting to win with a majority. That's what we are fighting to do. ""If we end up in a position where we are in a minority, we will go ahead and we will put forward a Queen's Speech and a Budget. ""If people want to vote for it, then good. If they don't want to vote for it, they are going to have to go back and speak to their constituents and explain to them why it is that we have a Tory government instead. ""If we are the largest party we go ahead - no deals - with our manifesto, our Budget and our Queen's Speech."" Mr Corbyn was more cautious when he tackled the question, but also insisted there would be no coalition deal. ""We are fighting every constituency to win this election, to form a Labour government,"" he said. ""We are not doing deals, we're not doing coalitions, we're not doing any agreements. ""We are fighting to win this election on a manifesto that I'm very proud of because it will fundamentally transform our society. That is what we are looking forward to doing on 9 June."" In his speech, Mr Corbyn delivered one of his strongest attacks yet on Mrs May's integrity - and asked voters to consider who they trusted more. He said the Tories are ""weak and wobbly"" and cannot be believed after the PM's U-turn on her controversial social care reforms and her failure to set out how many pensioners stand to lose their winter fuel payments - policies that have been widely credited as a factor in the narrowing of the polls. Mr Corbyn also turned his fire on the PM over Brexit, accusing her of risking a ""jobs meltdown"" with her hardline stance to negotiations that he said risked Britain crashing out of the EU without any deal at all. ""The Conservatives' reckless approach has left us isolated and marginalised, increasing the chances of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal, which would be the worst possible outcome for Britain,"" he told a campaign event in Basildon. ""That would mean slapping tariffs on the goods we export - an extra 10% on cars - with the risk that key manufacturers would leave for the European mainland, taking skilled jobs with them. ""In sector after sector, 'no deal' could prove to be an economic disaster. Theresa May's approach risks a jobs meltdown across Britain."" Responding to Labour's comments on a hung parliament, Conservative chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin said: ""The truth is out: Jeremy Corbyn will invite the other parties to prop him up as Prime Minister if there is a hung parliament on June 9. ""Brexit negotiations start 11 days after you vote, but instead of focusing on those negotiations, Corbyn would be busy haggling with Nicola Sturgeon and the Lib Dems. That will cause chaos."""

2017-06-02,Theresa May is under fierce attack from opponents for her response to Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-accused-of-dereliction-of-duty-over-trump-climate-move-10901624,"In a statement issued three hours after the US President's announcement at the White House, the Prime Minister expressed ""disappointment"" at the decision. But as senior Conservatives expressed their dismay, the PM was attacked by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party for failing to protest in more robust terms. Labour claimed the PM was guilty of a ""dereliction of duty"" and ""failing to raise the quietest peep"" in protest, while the Lib Dems said that after holding the President's hand she should ""hold his feet to the fire"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused Mrs May of an ""appalling abdication of leadership"" for failing to join Europe's other G7 members - France, Germany and Italy - in rejecting Mr Trump's call to renegotiate the deal. Reacting to the controversial announcement, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""President Trump called the Prime Minister this evening to discuss his decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement. ""The Prime Minister expressed her disappointment with the decision and stressed that the UK remained committed to the Paris Agreement, as she set out recently at the G7. ""She said that the Paris Agreement provides the right global framework for protecting the prosperity and security of future generations, while keeping energy affordable and secure for our citizens and businesses. ""The President made clear that the door remains open to future US involvement in the agreement. ""The Prime Minister and President agreed on the importance of continued cooperation on wider energy issues."" In a statement on Twitter shortly after Mr Trump's announcement, Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""UK played a major role in securing Paris Agreement and we are committed to it. ""Clean growth a key pillar of our modern industrial strategy."" Michael Howard, the former Conservative Party leader and a former environment secretary, also said that the UK's interests were served by maintaining its commitment to the UN process. ""It is clear that the UK's interests do not lie in allowing Mr Trump's position to sway our own; we can be friends, while agreeing to differ on this issue,"" he said. ""We have done very well from the UN climate convention - in the 25 years since Sir John Major and I negotiated it, Britons' wealth has grown faster than citizens of any other G7 nation, and our emissions have fallen further. ""Doing our fair share to combat climate change is clearly not harming our economy. ""As the Government seeks enhanced relationships with other nations around the world, maintaining our strong and stable commitment to reduce our carbon emissions while helping poorer countries do the same can only be a sensible strategy."" In a tweet, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Pulling out of the Paris climate deal is reckless and regressive. Instead of hand-holding, I'll work for a sustainable future for our planet."" But Labour's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, went much further, attacking the Prime Minister for not protesting against the President's decision. After criticising Mr Trump for ""an act of global, generational vandalism... inflicting damage that our grandchildren will be unable to undo"", she moved on to his ""so-called 'closest allies' in our own Tory government, who have failed to raise even the quietest peep in protest"". She said: ""Even earlier today, while Trump's decision hung in the balance and leaders around the world were pressuring him to do the right thing, all Theresa May could say was: It's up to the President to decide."" ""That is a total dereliction of her duty, both to our country and our planet, and it is not just her lack of backbone that has been exposed during this campaign, but her hopelessness at diplomacy and negotiation."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron urged the Prime Minister to use any influence she may have over the US President to urge him to reverse his decision. In a direct appeal to Mrs May, who was the first foreign leader to visit Mr Trump following his inauguration, Mr Farron said: ""You have gone to Washington to hold Donald Trump's hand, now is the time to hold his feet to the fire. ""If the special relationship between the Prime Minister and Mr Trump actually exists, it exists for moments like this. ""We need to make him see sense on climate change. ""Prime Minister: if your special relationship with Donald Trump means anything, prove it."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""Now more than ever world leaders must recognise the threat of climate change and join forces to protect public health, reduce toxic pollution and help sustain a greener planet. ""The President of the USA's decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord is profoundly regrettable."" Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: ""We are the climate movement. We will not be stopped by Trump. ""We are stronger. We will win."" But the UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said: ""Trump says he will withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Trump gets elected. Trump withdraws. That's democracy, folks."""
2017-06-02,The 2017 General Election will be remembered by history as the Brexit election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/general-election-five-key-seats-to-watch-in-8-june-poll-10900149,"But the overall story will be woven from a range of sub-plots that will play out across the 650 parliamentary constituencies that determine the outcome. Will Theresa May's gamble to increase her majority backfire if Labour puts aside its internal divisions and performs better than anyone expected mere weeks ago? Can the Conservatives roll back the years of famine in Scotland and re-establish a parliamentary presence there? A similar battle will be waged in Wales but here Labour is still the preferred choice of most voters. Then there is UKIP's and the Liberal Democrats' fate to be settled. Last time, more than one in eight voters chose to follow Nigel Farage's lead. Many of those voters have deserted, it appears, but will it be Labour or the Conservatives that has appeal? The Liberal Democrats have gone for broke with their Remain strategy - appealing to the almost half of the voters that wanted to stay inside the EU with the promise of another referendum. There are five key seats that taken together address these themes. The outcome in each will determine whether the Brexit election will be remembered as a brilliant tactical gambit by a new and inexperienced Prime Minister or a reckless and futile attempt to strengthen our hand in the negotiation with Europe. :: Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland One of the first to declare himself out of the 2017 election was Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP of the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency since 2010. A vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn, he supported his rivals at the two leadership elections. His decision not to contest the seat is symptomatic of the deep divisions that have undermined Labour for years. The critics say he jumped before the voters pushed him out of office given his slender 2,000 vote majority. The Conservatives need a swing of just 2.5% and the seat lies 21st on its target list. Success here should see Theresa May pass the 50-seat majority milepost. :: Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk An easier, although symbolically important, Conservative target is the delightfully named Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk which nestles in the Scottish borders. This was seized by the SNP from the Liberal Democrat incumbent in the drama of the 2015 election. But it is the Conservatives that lie a mere 328 votes short of the winning line. Each Conservative gain in Scotland has a disproportionate impact on the fate of the 'Scottish question'. The 1997 general election saw the Conservatives wiped out in Scotland and since then they have only ever held one constituency. Gaining Berwickshire and other seats will give credence to the Conservative claim to represent the union. :: Bridgend A Conservative advance in Leave-voting Wales is also an important part of the Brexit mandate. Bridgend tops the target list where a swing of 1,000 voters from the Labour to Conservative column tips the balance. Used to winning over half the votes here, Labour has watched its buffer-zone erode. In 2015, the Conservatives unexpectedly won the seat of Gower by just 27 votes. Should that return to Labour, then Bridgend would be the compensation the Conservatives need. :: Walsall North At the 2015 election, UKIP's Elizabeth Hazell secured over 8,000 votes in Walsall North. That might not sound a lot but it represented more than one in five of the votes cast in the constituency won by Labour's David Winnick. This is another Conservative target that if won lifts the majority to 'comfortable' rather than 'impressive'. Wooing more UKIP voters than Labour is the key Conservative strategy both here and across other marginal constituencies in the Midlands. :: Kingston and Surbiton As UKIP tumbles, the Liberal Democrats recover. Or so we were led to believe. So irate were Remain voters that they would easily fall into line behind the party that promised another go at answering the Europe question. A trio of knights of the realm, Sirs Vince, Simon and Ed would lead the charge, re-gaining the ground lost spectacularly in 2015. The Liberal Democrats have set their stall out to re-conquer south-west London which includes Ed Davey's former seat of Kingston and Surbiton. Ousted by 3,000 votes, Mr Davey now hopes to turn the tables on Conservative James Berry. Unlike in Richmond Park and Twickenham, however, the Green party is contesting the seat. In a close finish, this leakage of anti-Conservative voters could be crucial."

The data showed this was a drop from April's 2.6% - while on a monthly basis, prices across the country fell by 0.2%, following on from dips of 0.3% and 0.4% in March and April, respectively. The figures showed the average house price in the UK is currently around £208,711. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said it was too early to say whether the slowdown was ""merely a blip, a reflection of the impact of the squeeze on household budgets, or is due to mounting affordability pressures in key areas of the country"". He said: ""It is still early days, but this provides further evidence that the housing market is losing momentum. ""Moreover, this may be indicative of a wider slowdown in the household sector,"" he said, adding that it was unlikely to be linked to the upcoming General Election. ""In our view, household spending is likely to slow in the quarters ahead, along with the wider economy, as rising inflation increases the squeeze on household budgets. This, together with mounting housing affordability pressures, is likely to exert a drag on activity and house price growth in the quarters ahead,"" he said. ""However, the subdued level of building activity and the shortage of properties on the market are likely to provide support for prices. ""As a result, we continue to believe that a small increase in house prices of around 2% is likely over the course of 2017 as a whole,"" he added. Earlier this week, the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for home buyers fell to a seven-month low in April, in a further sign that the housing market may be slowing. The National Association of Estate Agents said buyers and sellers were taking a ""wait and see"" ahead of next week's vote."

US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of hacking into and leaking Democratic Party emails, helping Mr Trump to victory in last year's presidential election. Congressional and FBI investigations are under way into links between the Kremlin and Mr Trump's campaign. :: Former FBI director to testify in Russia inquiry The Russian President criticised what he branded ""Russo-phobic hysteria"" in the US and said it made it ""somewhat inconvenient to work with one another or even to talk"" and added ""someday this will have to stop"". The aim was to ""establish an atmosphere that is going to prevent us from addressing common issues, say with regard to terrorism,"" he claimed. He said Moscow had been encouraged by Mr Trump's campaign promises to improve Russia-US relations and expressed hope this could still happen. ""We are patient, we know how to wait and we will wait,"" Mr Putin said. :: Farage dismisses Russia investigation link The Russian leader hailed Mr Trump as ""a straightforward person, a frank person"" and said he viewed his US counterpart's lack of political background as beneficial because ""he has a fresh set of eyes"". Speaking at a meeting with senior editors of leading international news agencies in St Petersburg, Mr Putin denied state involvement in hacking insisting ""we never engage in that at the state level"". However, he said it was ""theoretically possible"" heightened tensions between Moscow and the West could lead some people to launch cyberattacks. Mr Putin said: ""Hackers are free people, just like artists who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start painting. ""The hackers are the same. They would wake up, read about something going on in interstate relations and if they feel patriotic, they may try to contribute to the fight against those who speak badly about Russia."" He also argued hackers could not influence the outcome of elections as public opinion was not that easy to manipulate."
2017-06-02,"Labour has returned its focus to the railways after claiming that passengers would be £1,000 better off"" if they were to win the General Election. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-rail-passengers-would-be-1631k-better-off-under-renationalisation-10900156,"The party has already said that it would renationalise the network were it to be in Government, bringing franchises back into public ownership as they run out. It has also said that it would bring in new caps on how much fares could rise, using a different measure of inflation that, says Labour, would result in lower increases. ""Under the Conservatives, rail fares have sky-rocketed and tickets are some of the most expensive in Europe,"" said leader Jeremy Corbyn. ""Labour will take Britain's railways back into public control and put more money into people's pockets by capping fares. This will save commuters £1,014 on their rail season tickets over the next Parliament."" However, the party is likely to face claims that it has distorted the figures, after quoting a ""potential cost"" to commuters if a Conservative Government raised fares by more than inflation - a system that was actually scrapped four years ago. Under existing rules, certain train fares - known as ""regulated"" fares - can only rise by a measure of inflation known as the retail price index (RPI). This figure includes housing costs and is calculated in a slightly different, and much more complicated, way. It normally produces a significantly higher figure than the consumer price index (CPI) statistic, which is the one normally used to measure the price of living. For example, at the moment RPI is running at 3.5% while inflation measured by CPI is 2.7%. Labour says it will change the system so fares can only go up by the lower CPI figure, protecting passengers from painful increases. According to its figures, that would mean a cumulative saving of £551 over the five years of the next Parliament, compared to increases based on RPI. But Labour has gone a step further, assuming that a Tory Government would go back to the previous system of allowing increases of 1% more than RPI. That is how the party has reached the figure of £1,000, but there's no mention of such a change in the Conservative manifesto. Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: ""Theresa May's failure to commit to freezing rail fares shows just how out of touch they are. ""Privatised rail has failed and it will take more than tinkering around at the edges to deliver much needed improvements for passengers."" A Conservative spokesman said: ""Renationalising the railways will either add billions of pounds to our national debt or hit ordinary working people in the pocket with higher taxes. ""It's yet more economic shambles from Labour."" There is little doubt that the train network does need huge investment, but there is also disagreement about how that can be delivered. For one thing, critics of Labour's policy are likely to claim that curtailing increases in rail fares will less money being available for investment. That, in turn, is likely to mean the Treasury being asked to make up the shortfall. Some will portray this as a subsidy for train users. Popular, perhaps, with commuters, but not so attractive for voters who never use the network. Also, the great bulk of Britain's daily train journeys happen around London and the South-East - the idea of capping train fares would be welcomed in London's commuter belt, but that is also one of the most fiercely Conservative regions of the whole country."

The newspaper said Mr Farage has not been accused of wrongdoing and is not a suspect or target of the investigation. Mr Farage has been drawn into the wide-ranging inquiry because of his relationships with individuals linked to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, according to the report. WikiLeaks published hacked emails from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign and is suspected of having worked with Russia via third parties, according to former CIA director John Brennan. The FBI is looking into alleged collusion between the Kremlin and President Trump's campaign team, aimed at securing the White House for the real estate tycoon. Mr Farage said a meeting with Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in March was set up by radio station LBC with a view to carrying out an interview. In a statement titled ""fake news"", he said: ""In response to the Guardian article, it has taken me a long time to finish reading because I am laughing so much. ""This hysterical attempt to associate me with the Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and the election of President Trump. ""For the record I have never been to Russia, I've had no business dealings with Russia in my previous life and I have appeared approximately three times on RT (Russia Today) in the last 18 months. ""I consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia."" Mr Farage's office said he would be making no further comment on the matter. He was the first British politician to meet the President in person following his election victory, and Mr Trump later suggested Mr Farage should become the British ambassador to the US. Mr Farage recently ended an interview with the German newspaper Zeit in which he was quizzed over alleged links with Russia - including whether his campaign to leave the EU during last year's referendum received Russian money - and his visit to Mr Assange. He denied Russian money was given, saying: ""I never received a penny from Russia. I wouldn't have taken it, even if it had been offered."""

It blames rising inflation, triggered by a slump in the value of the pound and an increase in the cost of imports in the wake of Britain's Brexit vote. This, it said, has pushed up prices by 3% in the last three months, compared with a 1% increase over the previous two years. It added prices could go up further as the figures do not take into account the rise of 3.9% in alcohol duty announced in the March Budget, adding another 8p to the average-priced bottle. WSTA chief executive Miles Beale said: ""Last year the WSTA predicted that Brexit and the fall in the value of the pound, compounded by rising inflation, would force the UK wine industry to up their prices. ""Sadly this is now a reality as an average priced bottle of wine in the UK is at an all-time high. ""Unfortunately, for both British businesses and consumers, we are clear that this is not a one-off adjustment, but rather that wine prices will continue to rise. ""We all know that Brexit will be complicated, but something has got to give and Government must start showing its support for the UK wine industry and the 275,000 jobs that our industry supports by tackling our excessive duty rates at the Autumn Budget."" In October, the WSTA warned the price of a bottle of wine from the EU could go up by an average of 29p as a result of Brexit, with a weaker pound since the 23 June vote having a ""serious and immediate impact"" on importers. It said bottles from outside the EU could increase by an average of 22p. The group said 99% of the 1.8 billion bottles of wine consumed in the UK are imported, meaning that any additional potential tariffs - should the UK leave the EU without a trade deal - would have a ""punishing"" effect."

The latest Scottish poll, by Ipsos Mori for STV, has the SNP on 43%, the Tories and Labour both on 25% and the Lib Dems on 5%. Campaigning in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said: ""With a week to go, Scotland is really finding itself in a potentially pivotal position in this election. ""We've seen Theresa May exposed as a weak and evasive Prime Minister who can't even answer questions about the impact of her own cuts on pensioners and hard-working families across the country.

Mr Rennie began his ""flying finish"" to the campaign with a visit in Edinburgh West, one of the party's top target seats, while Ms Dugdale was in Edinburgh East.

A vote for a Liberal Democrat is a vote against another divisive independence referendum, it's a vote for a chance to reject a bad deal on Brexit and it's a vote on prioritising investment in our services like mental health."""

In the video officers are seen approaching Woods in the car. Woods can be seen stumbling and swaying through a sobriety test before being arrested. A breath test showed a blood alcohol level of 0.00% and in a statement Woods, 41, said his condition had been caused by the effects of prescription medicines. He had been taking drugs after having several operations on his back. A police report claimed Woods was found asleep at the wheel and when officers spoke to him he had ""extremely slow and slurred speech"". In a statement, the 14-time major champion said: ""I didn't realise the mix of medications had affected me so strongly."" He apologised to his family, friends and fans, adding he would ""do everything"" in his power ""to ensure this never happens again"". Woods underwent surgery on his back for the fourth time on 20 April and last week claimed he had ""not felt this good in years"". Since winning the last of his major titles at the US Open in 2008, Woods' golfing career has taken a spectacular slide amid problems in his personal life. He admitted infidelity in 2009 and divorced his wife and mother of their two children a year later. Woods recently said he was ""positive"" about a return to golf following his surgery. Woods will appear in Palm Beach County Court on 5 July charged with drinking under the influence."

2017-06-02,President Donald Trump has announced plans for the United States to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170602020248/http://news.sky.com/story/trump-announces-us-will-withdraw-from-paris-climate-deal-10901316,"In a news conference in the Rose Garden at the White House, Mr Trump said he was fulfilling his ""solemn duty to protect America and its citizens"". He said: ""I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. ""Therefore, in order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. ""But begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction. ""We're getting out, but we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair."" Mr Trump said the US will ""cease all implementation"" of the accord as of Thursday. But France, Germany and Italy have said the climate deal could not be renegotiated. White House documents claim the accord ""is a BAD deal for Americans"" and that by withdrawing Mr Trump will keep ""his campaign promise to put American workers first"". The documents state: ""The accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama administration and signed out of desperation. ""The US is already leading the world in energy production and doesn't need a bad deal that will harm American workers."" It also adds that the agreement ""front loads costs on American people"" and that Mr Trump hopes to seek ""a better deal"". Only Syria and Nicaragua are non-participants in the 195-nation accord agreed in Paris in 2015. But Syria was unable to send an official to sign the accord because of the civil war and Nicaragua chose not to sign because it felt the agreement did not go far enough. Nations voluntarily committed to steps aimed at curbing global emissions of greenhouse gases under the accord. That includes carbon dioxide generated from burning fossil fuels blamed for a warming planet, rising sea levels, droughts and more frequent violent storms. Former president Barack Obama, who was instrumental in brokering the deal, said the Trump administration was joining a ""small handful of nations that reject the future"". In a statement, he said: ""The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. ""I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect the future generations the one planet we've got."" Mr Trump had vowed to cancel the Paris accord within 100 days of becoming president on 20 January. But he has come under pressure from advisers, businesses and politicians of both parties to keep the US in the agreement. Under Mr Obama, the US had committed to reducing its emissions by between 26% and 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. The US accounts for more than 15% of the worldwide total of greenhouse gas emissions. Only China exceeds it."

In a statement, Scotland Yard confirmed Butt was known to police and MI5 - but added there was no intelligence to suggest an attack was being planned. They went on to say that Redouane was not known to those authorities. Sky News knew the name of at least one attacker but we did not publish it at the request of the security services. However, we have built up an extensive profile of Khuram Butt, his family life and career. :: Second victim of London terror attack named Local to his home in east London, Butt was known as Abu Zaitun - or Abu for short. The 27-year-old came to Britain as a child when his parent's sought asylum from Pakistan - and he lived in a ground-floor flat in Barking. Neighbours tell a mixed picture of Butt. One woman, who didn't want to be named, said he stared angrily whenever he saw women cycling on the estate. She described it as ""sinister"" and ""sexist"". Another neighbour said they enjoyed arguing about Arsenal and whether Arsene Wenger should remain manager. :: LIVE - Mayor says terror 'will not win' Two young boys told me he had given them sweets and £2 each in a nearby park last week. He told them they must be polite to their dads and respect their elders. But a parent also told us that she confronted him and asked him not to speak to her children any more - fearful they were being radicalised. An online CV shows that Butt obtained an NVQ in business administration in 2009, and a diploma in teaching English to adults in August 2016. The CV lists two jobs: one he started in May at Transport for London, and another at a company called Auriga Holdings, which we believe to be a franchise for a local KFC restaurant. :: Anti-terror barriers installed on London bridges It has also been reported that Butt worked at a local gym, Topshop and a property company - although Sky News has not independently verified this. Rachid Redouane was 30 years old and born in July 1986. He had said he was Moroccan and Libyan. Scotland Yard says he also used the name Rachid Elkhdar, as well as a different date of birth which made him five years younger. According to Sky sources, an Irish ID card was found on Redouane's body. :: The moment police took down terrorists Police in Ireland are investigating, with detectives trying to establish whether he travelled to Syria. He is understood to have lived in the Rathmines area of Dublin for eighteen months between 2014 and 2016. He was married to a Scottish wife. An investigation is under way to establish the identity of the third accomplice - and Scotland Yard has asked for people with information about any of these men to come forward."
2017-06-06,It is a gulf Arab state that supports various Islamist groups - with critics saying it uses a TV channel as a tool of its foreign policy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170606043406/http://news.sky.com/story/why-arab-rivals-have-joined-together-to-take-on-qatar-10905486,"You could say that about a number of Arab countries, but it is Qatar that is being singled out for criticism and diplomatic ostracisation to a degree seldom seen before in the Arab world. The reason? Qatar has long been out of line with the regional consensus and its neighbours believe this is the time to pull the small Gulf kingdom into line. Other countries in the region may well support various Islamist militias in Syria. Some sponsor TV channels perceived by many to have clearly biased agendas. Saudi Arabia is accused of spending billions exporting a hardline form of Islam that its critics say leads to extremism. But none of them share the sympathies and pet causes of Qatar. :: Chaos in Qatar as Arab states cut travel links It has provided a base for the leadership of Palestinian militant organisation Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood which has long been a thorn in the side of Egypt's military dictatorship. It has good relations with Hezbollah to the fury of most other Sunni Arab nations because of the Lebanese Shia militia's close ties with Shia theocratic regional power Iran. Qatar defends these relations with diverse groups because it says there is considerable support for them among ordinary people across the Arab world. But that cuts no ice with the elites who rule them. Qatar-based TV channel Al Jazeera has long been an irritant for the undemocratic elites who run that world. It was a scapegoat during the Arab Spring uprisings, its staff often the victims of intimidation and worse by repressive regimes fighting for survival during those revolutions. And regimes across the Middle East have for a long time sought to take revenge. Qatar has been cast out before. But this is more severe and likely to be longer lasting. :: Oil price wobble amid Qatar diplomatic rift Its regional rivals have found a common sense of purpose. They are united in their fear of Iran and suspicion about Qatar's alleged ambivalence towards Tehran. And they have been galvanised by US President Donald Trump's recent tour of the region. Mr Trump challenged them to tackle extremists in their own backyards. They have instead come down hard on a country they say is easy on extremists. Previous administrations have taken a more nuanced, even-handed approach cultivating ties with as many countries as possible. :: Investors watch Gulf diplomatic spat with unease The Trump administration is being more blunt: stamp out extremism or else. In that climate, Qatar's maverick foreign policy is more exposed. Qatar has little leverage if the region remains united against it. The country houses a huge US military base, but it could be moved. The diplomatic rupture is sending economic shockwaves across the region which will cause concern for all its governments - but Qatar is smaller and more vulnerable than its far richer, bigger neighbours and has more to fear from a protracted economic fallout. It may choose to try and sit this one out as it has with previous moments of isolation, hoping the alliance ranged against it will begin to fracture, but it won't be able to for long."
2017-06-06,"On Saturday, I went up to Manchester to cover a benefit concert on a scale far bigger than anything I had imagined.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170606043406/http://news.sky.com/story/one-love-manchester-citys-unbreakable-spirit-10905045,"After the unimaginable happened at the Manchester Arena, it was clear the music industry was determined to step up. Ariana Grande wanted to perform again to honour the victims, so organisers were attempting the impossible - throw a mega concert with some of the world's biggest stars in less than one week. I'd spent the best part of that time apologetically trying to get answers from it's press team about how it would work. How long would the show last? What could we film? Would we see the stage? There wasn't much The Outside Organisation could really say. There was a lot of: ""Honestly? We're not sure...but we'll make this work"". On Saturday, while filming preparations at the cricket ground, I got to talking to Outside's CEO, Dominic Mohan, former editor of The Sun. ""It's remarkable isn't it?,"" he said, looking down from the ground's stands at the roadies, riggers, lighting technicians. ""These people have agreed to drop everything and come here to make this happen."" Staging a massive benefit concert just four days after the idea was floated is pretty remarkable. Was it not for Festival Republic - a subsidiary of Live Nation who were running Grande's Dangerous Wiman tour - being on board as one of the producers it would have been a struggle. Securing the talent was down to Ariana Grande's management Scooter Braun. More than a few favours were called in to make a concert of this scale happen in such a short time, but it was being pushed through by sheer determination. Then, on Saturday night, everything suddenly stopped. Less than two weeks after Manchester, terrorists had attacked London. Again choosing to target innocent people on a night out. For those who'd been at the Ariana gig, or had loved ones caught up in the attack, deciding whether or not they felt ready to return to a concert environment must have already been a challenge. Waking up to learn it had happened must have brought all those memories back. To then decide to come out, not give into fear, showed incredible strength. Security was never going to be an issue. Armed police had patrolled the site throughout the weekend, Old Trafford Cricket Ground was on lock-down. Sniffer dogs inspected everything that came in. Everyone was given a full body pat down before being allowed into the arena, it was a ring of steel. Inside, double the number of stewards were on hand. Smiling and supportive, there to quickly escort anyone out who might be struggling to special quiet rooms. When Marcus Mumford, from Mumford & Sons, opened the show by asking the audience to stand for a moment's silence, 50,000 people stopped. You could have heard a pin drop. ""Let's not be afraid,"" were the next words he said. Manchester wasn't. The line-up was pitched perfectly. Young pop acts which meant something to the young audience - Katy Perry, Little Mix, Justin Bieber - mixed with music that meant something to Manchester - Liam Gallagher, Robbie Williams, Chris Martin singing Don't Look Back in Anger. The emotional parts, for me, came from some unexpected moments. Looking down from the press room to see the sun break through the clouds as the entire stadium danced and sang with Pharrel Williams and Miley Cyrus to the song Happy. Manchester, then London, it's been a truly awful couple of weeks - to see and to hear that defiance. Ariana Grande's performance of My Everything with the Parrs Wood High School was another. How the little girl who led the singing looked like she was bursting with emotion to be singing with her idol. The thought that many of the 22 who died that night were around the same age as those students. Then there was the policeman that fist bumped every person as they walked past him to get to the toilets. The Red Cross volunteers that kept being asked to pose for selfies. And the people at the back who grabbed hands with people they didn't know and danced in a gigantic circle. Proudly holding hands with emergency workers who helped this city to get through the darkest of times. Given the number of countries it was shown in, combined with the fact it was live streamed, it's estimated One Love Manchester beat the billion people who tuned in to Live Aid in 1985. It took a Herculean effort to make the concert happen, as I left I met people who could barely keep their eyes open they'd had such little sleep. They did it all to raise money for the charity which will support those people were affected by the attack, the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. It was awful what happened to Manchester, it's awful what's happened in London, and this was what we needed. This strength, this determination - this unbreakable spirit. Well done Manchester, you were brilliant."

Grande had arranged Sunday's concert at Manchester's Old Trafford cricket ground in tribute to the 22 people killed and 116 injured at the Manchester Arena on 22 May. The 23-year-old star arrived on stage an hour into the show, for which there were extra security measures in place following Saturday night's terror attack in London. Grande wore a white jumper emblazoned with the slogan One Love Manchester as she performed. Many in the crowd were in tears as Grande sang with a choir from Parrs Wood High School. Some members of the choir had been present at the tragic 22 May show. Grande comforted soloist Natasha Seth, who was overcome with emotion, mouthing to the schoolgirl: ""Babe, it's ok."" In between songs, Grande told the crowd: ""I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for coming today, I love you so, so much. Thank you. ""I think the kind of love you're displaying is the kind of medicine the world really needs right now. So I want to thank you for being just that."" Grande described how she changed her plans for the show after the mother of bombing victim Olivia Campbell had revealed the 15-year-old ""would have wanted to hear the hits"". She joined Coldplay to perform Oasis hit Don't Look Back In Anger, recalling how city centre crowds had spontaneously burst into a rendition of the song in the days after the Manchester bombing. Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Usher, Miley Cyrus, Liam Gallagher, Niall Horan and The Black Eyed Peas were among other A-list acts to appear on stage, with the Old Trafford show raising money for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. More than £10m has already been raised, with £2m of the total sum donated during the three hours of the benefit concert solely through text and online pledges. All of those who had attended Grande's concert last month had been offered free tickets to Sunday's show, while those who were still recovering from their injuries in hospital were watching on TV. The large crowd had fallen at the start of the concert to remember those who were killed and injured in both Manchester and London. Kicking off the concert, Marcus Mumford told concert-goers: ""Let's not be afraid."" Robbie Williams led the thousands inside the venue in a chorus of: ""Manchester, we're strong, we're strong, we're strong. ""We're still singing our songs, our songs, our songs."" Additional security measures were in place for the concert following Saturday night's marauding van and knife attack in London. Some of those attending Old Trafford admitted to feeling nervous in the wake of the third mass casualty terror attack in the UK within four months. Before Grande's appearance, the star's manager Scooter Braun told the crowd: ""Last night, this nation was challenged and all of you were challenged and you had a decision to make if you were going to come out here tonight. ""And this is so beautiful, you guys made that decision, you looked fear right in the face and you said 'no we are Manchester and the world is watching'."" Grande was in tears after being joined on stage by all her fellow artists. She ended the concert by singing Somewhere Over The Rainbow."

2017-06-06,"Theresa May upbraided the big internet companies for providing a ""safe space"" for terrorists.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170606043406/http://news.sky.com/story/three-key-battlegrounds-for-fighting-terrorism-online-10905480,"Facebook, Google and Twitter all responded quickly, condemning the attack and pointing to their existing anti-terrorism work. But in the back and forth, it's perhaps not immediately clear what the issues are. There are three, and they're distinct. :: ENCRYPTION Encryption has long been a source of friction between governments and technology companies. It means scrambling information so that only the sender and receiver can read a message. Criminals - and governments - can't peep. It's used by messaging apps like WhatsApp, iMessage and Telegram, as well as in internet banking and e-commerce to keep transactions secure. The UK Government argues encryption provides a safe place for terrorists to communicate but they don't want to ban it, just limit it. Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told Sky News: ""Where we are trying to beat terrorism there is going to be a lawful basis for doing so and it's not enough for companies to say 'oh well it's encrypted' because they know perfectly well they can alter their algorithms to enable that material to be intercepted where appropriate."" Technology companies argue they can't limit encryption without effectively removing it for everyone. If the UK Government has access to your messages or financial information, so can any other government - hello Russia! - or criminal. For example, the recent NHS cyberattack was possible because the US government found a weakness in Microsoft Windows, exploited it, then had that knowledge stolen in turn by hackers. And encryption is based on mathematics. If WhatsApp or Apple remove encryption, it's straightforward for bad actors to use another, less conscientious, platform, or to make their own. :: INTELLIGENCE REQUESTS The tech giants are mainly based on the West Coast of America. That means they obey US laws - not the UK's. The process for security services and police requesting data, known as MLAT, is very slow. Matt Tait, an ex-GCHQ analyst and now consultant, told Sky News: ""Both the State Department in the US and Home Office in the UK need to be involved. ""It's a very long-winded process and, as we've seen in the past, it can take hundreds of days to service these requests, which is simply not the pace that is necessary for these investigations."" That's not really the fault of tech companies. But work is under way at diplomatic levels to come up with a new bilateral agreement. :: EXTREMIST MATERIAL Tech companies have come under scrutiny from advertisers about hosting extremist content, particularly YouTube. Facebook recently announced it was nearly doubling its team of moderators who remove images, videos and posts that violate its guidelines. For governments, the specific fear is that people are radicalised online - through videos but also via one-on-one interaction. The Daily Telegraph reported that one of the London Bridge attackers was radicalised watching YouTube videos. All platforms remove a lot of content already. It's easy enough when the material is clearly terrorism-related. But what the UK Government labels ""harmful"" or ""extremist"" is harder to define. The issue of free speech quickly raises its head. David Levesley, a former Facebook employee and now social media manager at the i newspaper, told Sky News: ""I do think there is something tech companies can do and it's by looking at working in smaller communities, instead of just considering the two billion people that use them. ""There are also groups that they can interact with and try and not censor but moderate and communicate with."""

Sallis died peacefully with his family by his side on 2 June, his agents announced. His role as Wallace, a loveable inventor with a penchant for Wensleydale cheese and a canine companion called Gromit, made his voice famous around the world. He first became involved with the show after its creator Nick Park wrote to Sallis when he was a student in 1983 - and asked him to voice the clay character. Sallis agreed, on the condition that £50 was donated to his favourite charity. The cartoon went on to scoop several Academy Awards - with Sallis speaking of his delight at becoming an unlikely Hollywood star and enjoying success so late on in his career. Sallis said: ""It is pleasing knowing millions are going to see your work and enjoy it. ""To still be involved in a project like this at my age is heart-warming.

Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""heartbroken"" a Canadian was among those killed. He said: ""These hateful acts do not deter us; they only strengthen our resolve. ""Canadians stand united with the British people. We will continue to work together with the United Kingdom and all our allies to fight terrorism and bring perpetrators to justice."" The injured victims A total of 48 people - including foreign nationals from Spain, Germany, New Zealand and Australia - were hurt in the attack, and 36 of them are still being treated in hospital. NHS England said 21 of those are in a critical condition. The three male attackers were gunned down by armed police in a barrage of bullets within eight minutes of the officers receiving the first report of the atrocity. Those hurt included people stabbed in the face, neck and stomach, with the attackers reported to have wielded foot-long knives. Oliver Dowling, a 32-year-old from New Zealand, was left in a coma after undergoing four hours of surgery for his injuries. It was reported that his girlfriend, Marie Bondeville, was also injured. It is thought three Australians were wounded. Candice Hedge, 31, needed an operation after being stabbed in the throat as she ate dinner with her boyfriend. Andrew Morrison received stitches for a wound and was on his way home to Australia. Sky News Australia showed footage of him holding a bandage around his neck, saying: ""All of a sudden a guy comes up with a knife, I ducked it, but he got me,"" he said in the footage. The identity of a third Australian injured has yet to be confirmed. Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho was also slashed in the throat after reportedly stepping in to help a lone bouncer being targeted by the attackers. Videos emerged online of Mr Ho being escorted topless by police after ""jumping in"" when the guard was attacked. ""Don't know whether it was stupid or noble to jump in and break up the fight,"" he posted on Facebook moments after the incident. ""But two a******** trying to do over the lone bouncer on the door isn't happening on my watch."" A British Transport Police officer and an off-duty Metropolitan Police officer are in hospital with serious injuries but neither are believed to be in a life-threatening condition, Scotland Yard said.

Hundreds of flights were cancelled after a shutdown of BA's data centre knocked out its systems, and reports suggest it could face a compensation bill of up to £150m. Mr Walsh, speaking at an airline industry meeting in Mexico, said: ""We have commissioned an independent company to conduct a full investigation."" He said the company would be ""happy to disclose details"" and that as a result of lessons learned ""we'll all be better"". The IAG chief executive explained that the incident occurred when an electrical engineer disconnected the ""uninterruptible power supply"", therefore shutting down the data centre. He said that would not have been a problem in itself, but the damage was caused when the power was restored in an uncontrolled fashion. Mr Walsh said: ""It's very clear to me that you can make a mistake in disconnecting the power. ""It's difficult for me to understand how to make a mistake in reconnecting the power."" He admitted that the incident had damaged the British Airways brand but said it would recover, and apologised again to customers. ""This is something I wouldn't wish on anybody,"" Mr Walsh said. ""When you see customers who suffered, you wouldn't want it to happen to any airline or any business."" Consumer group Which? has said that BA ought to do more than the legal minimum to help affected customers after the three days of chaos that started on 27 May. It claims some passengers were forced to sleep on terminal floors, with complaints that staff did not keep travellers properly informed. Affected customers were later caught in a tussle between the airline and insurers over where to make claims for expenses incurred as a result of disruption - which saw BA agree to change the wording of advice on its website."

They said of Mr Khan: ""He has risen above this crisis of death and destruction, as mayors continue to do, to alleviate fear, to bring comfort to his people of London and to give support to the first responders who continue to protect, defend and provide emergency care to his people of London. ""Thank you, Mayor Khan, for your leadership during this crisis."" New York City's mayor Bill de Blasio had already made his feelings known on Twitter, writing: ""Mayor Sadiq Khan is doing an extraordinary job supporting Londoners in a time of pain. President Trump's attack on him is unacceptable."" At least seven people were killed and dozens injured after three terrorists drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and then got out to stab people. In the hours after the attack, US President Mr Trump tweeted to his 31.6 million followers using it as a reason to push his travel ban on visitors and refugees from six mainly Muslim countries; offer support to London; call for the end of ""political correctness""; bring guns into the debate and finally to twist Mr Khan's words and to criticise him. Mr Khan's spokesperson had described the first round of presidential tweets as ""ill-informed"" - and said they had deliberately taken the mayor's remarks out of context. Mr Trump hit back, however, tweeting: ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM (mainstream media) is working hard to sell it!"" Staff of previous president Barack Obama were among those who tweeted their disgust. Ben Rhodes, a former national security aide to Mr Obama, wrote: ""To my friends in the UK: I apologise for this.""

Lewis Lukens, the acting US ambassador to the UK (a permanent one has yet to be confirmed) tweeted: ""I commend the strong leadership of the Mayor of London as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack."" Mr Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, however, blamed the media for putting ""spin"" on the issue. She said: ""I don't see that the president is picking a fight with the mayor of London at all."""
2017-06-06,The Tories are unleashing Boris Johnson to attack Jeremy Corbyn in the tense final days of the General Election campaign.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170606043406/http://news.sky.com/story/tories-unleash-attack-dog-boris-johnson-on-jeremy-corbyn-10905596,"With one new opinion poll suggesting the Tory lead over Labour is down to just one point, the Foreign Secretary will say the thought of Mr Corbyn as Prime Minister makes him ""shudder"". Survation, which at the start of last month gave the Conservatives a 17-point lead, now puts the Tories on 41.5% with Labour on 40.4%, the Liberal Democrats on 6% and Ukip on 3%. Mr Johnson's attack comes as Theresa May and the Conservatives attempt to steer the election agenda back to Brexit after facing accusations of cutting police numbers. Labour is returning to another issue on which the Tories have looked vulnerable during the campaign, Mrs May's social care plans - branded a ""dementia tax"" by opponents. Speaking in Brexit-voting north-east England, Mr Johnson will say: ""It is this country's destiny to engage not just with our friends and partners in the EU but with the whole of the rest of the world. ""If we are to make the most of that opportunity then we need the right economic policies. ""And it makes me shudder to think that we could seriously be about to elect a Corbyn-led coalition that would impose destructive new taxes on businesses, on homes, on gardens - at the very moment when we could be about to go forward with Global Britain."" Despite accusations from critics he is prone to gaffes, Mr Johnson has been used by the Tory high command as their leading attack dog against Mr Corbyn during this election campaign. He previously called the Labour leader a ""mutton-headed old mugwump"" and, after Mr Corbyn linked UK foreign policy to terror attacks in Britain, Mr Johnson called the Labour leader ""monstrous"", despite making a similar link himself in the past. On Brexit, the Prime Minister is also promising new trade structures to make sure all parts of the UK benefit from leaving the EU. A new Board of Trade will bring together leading figures from business and politics across all four corners of the UK. The Conservatives will also seek to establish a network of new HM Trade Commissioners around the world to promote British exports, seek inward investment and drive UK trade policy overseas. The Prime Minister will say: ""The UK has always been a great trading nation, but 12 months ago the British people chose to build a more Global Britain. ""As we begin this exciting new chapter in our nation's story, we are ready to pursue a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the EU and strike new deals with old friends and new allies around the globe."" But while the Tories campaign again on Brexit, Labour is claiming Conservative plans to means-test the winter fuel allowance for pensioners could lead to almost 4,000 more deaths this winter. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has branded the Tory manifesto - including scrapping the pensions ""triple lock"" and changes to social care - ""the single biggest attack on pensioners in a generation"". Labour highlighted public health research that found the fuel allowance was responsible for a 46% fall in excess winter deaths between 2000 and 2012 - accounting for 4,277 less deaths out of the drop of 9,298. The party calculates that if the Conservative plans were to lead to 90% of pensioners losing the allowance it could be expected to lead to an additional 3,850 deaths this winter. Mr McDonnell said: ""Removing the winter fuel payments from millions of pensioners could leave thousands of the most vulnerable at even more risk this winter. ""On top of their dementia tax, it means that pensioners in our country will struggle to heat their homes and keep their homes under the Tories."" Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green criticised ""irresponsible scaremongering"" by Labour and insisted the Tories ""will always look after the most vulnerable""."

Police say searches are ongoing. It comes after seven women and five men, aged between 19 and 60, were arrested under the Terrorism Act on Sunday following raids on flats in Barking and East Ham, east London. A 55-year-old man was later released without charge. Several residents at the Elizabeth Fry flats in Barking, where a number of the arrests were made, said they recognised one of the suspected attackers from a photograph. They said he had children and had lived in the area for a number of years. One neighbour told Sky News the suspect was ""a very affable person"" who was ""very much a member of the community"" and ""always pleasant to our family"". Islamic State has claimed ""a detachment"" of its fighters were behind the attack, according to the Amaq online news agency which is affiliated with the jihadists. :: LIVE - Police raids after terror attack Witnesses to Saturday night's attack said terrorists deliberately drove into pedestrians on London Bridge shortly after 10pm - in the same way as Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood. Attacking people after abandoning the van, the three attackers headed to Borough Market where the pubs and restaurants were packed with Saturday night crowds, many watching the Champions League final. One woman, Elizabeth O'Neill, said her son Daniel was approached by one of the men who said, ""this is for my family, this is for Islam"", before sticking a knife in him. The 23-year-old was left with a seven-inch wound from his stomach to his back and was saved by a friend who applied a tourniquet and took him downstairs in a pub. :: 'Hero' tried to distract attackers from victim The three men, wearing fake suicide bomb vests, were shot dead by eight officers outside a pub after police opened fire with an ""unprecedented"" hail of 50 bullets, while a bystander was also shot. Tales of heroism emerged in the aftermath, with one British Transport Police officer taking on the trio armed only with his baton before being stabbed in the head, face and leg. An off-duty Metropolitan Police officer was also injured after he tackled the men. Six of those who lost their lives were pronounced dead at the scene. The first victim of the attack has been named as Canadian national Christine Archibald, who worked in a homeless shelter until she moved to Europe to be with her fiance. Her family said in a statement: ""We grieve the loss of our beautiful, loving daughter and sister. She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected. ""She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death."" :: Eight minutes of terror: What happened where A total of 48 people - including foreign nationals from Spain, Germany, New Zealand and Australia - were hurt in the attack, and 21 of them critically injured. France's foreign ministry says seven of its citizens were wounded, and four are in a critical condition. Another French national is unaccounted for. A vigil will be held on Monday evening near London Bridge in honour of the victims of the attack, while a minute's silence will take place at 11am on Tuesday. Flags in Downing Street and elsewhere in central London have been flying at half-mast. Counter-terrorism police units and security services have launched a huge investigation for the third time in a matter of weeks. Speaking on Sunday outside Scotland Yard, the Metropolitan Police's assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said ""significant progress"" had been made in identifying the attackers. He said that as well as more armed police across the capital in coming days, ""the public will also see increased physical measures in order to keep public safe on London's bridges"". London Bridge rail station has reopened but as exit only, while the Underground station will be open, Transport for London said. The mainline station is a key gateway for travellers heading to Kent and Surrey, with National Rail saying services on Southeastern, Southern and Thameslink are likely to be disrupted.

2017-06-06,Scotland Yard has named two of the terrorists involved in the London Bridge attack as Khuram Shazad Butt and Rachid Redouane.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170606043406/http://news.sky.com/story/what-we-know-about-the-london-attackers-10905642,":: Khuram Butt Butt was known to police and MI5 and Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said an investigation into him started in 2015. But, with ""no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned...the investigation had been prioritised accordingly"". In his neighbourhood in east London, Butt was known as Abu Zaitun - or Abu for short. The 27-year-old came to Britain as a child when his parents sought asylum from Pakistan - and he lived in a ground-floor flat in Barking. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said he stared angrily whenever he saw women cycling on the estate. She described it as ""sinister"" and ""sexist"". Another neighbour said they enjoyed arguing about Arsenal and whether Arsene Wenger should remain manager. Two young boys told me he had given them sweets and £2 each in a nearby park last week. He told them they must be polite to their dads and respect their elders. But a parent also told us that she confronted him and asked him not to speak to her children any more - fearful they were being radicalised. An online CV shows that Butt obtained an NVQ in business administration in 2009, and a diploma in teaching English to adults in August 2016. The CV lists two jobs: one he started in May at Transport for London, and another at a company called Auriga Holdings, which we believe to be a franchise for a local KFC restaurant. :: Rachid Redouane Redouane was 30 years old and born in July 1986. He claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan. Scotland Yard says he also used the name Rachid Elkhdar, as well as a different date of birth which made him five years younger. Redouane was not known to those authorities. According to Sky sources, an Irish ID card was found on Redouane's body. Reports have said he lived in Rathmines, Dublin. It is believed he used Irish jurisdiction to get a European Union permit allowing him to be in the UK. Police in Ireland are investigating, with detectives trying to establish whether he travelled to Syria. He is understood to have lived in the Rathmines area of Dublin for 18 months between 2014 and 2016. He was married to a Scottish wife. :: A third terrorist An investigation is under way to establish the identity of the third accomplice - and Scotland Yard has asked for people with information about any of the three men to come forward."

Excluding those who answered ""neither"" or ""don't know"", 78% support arming police and 22% oppose. The poll was conducted in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in Manchester and London. Theresa May has come under pressure from Labour for presiding over cuts to numbers of armed police, while she in turn has criticised Jeremy Corbyn over his past opposition to a ""shoot to kill"" policy in the event of a terror attack. Support for routinely arming police is consistent across every demographic, although Londoners are slightly less likely to support arming police than people in the rest of the country. They remain overwhelmingly in favour, however, by 68% to 25% compared with 72% support and 20% opposition across the country as a whole. A poll of Metropolitan Police officers in February found that 44% think there should be more specialist firearms officers in their force, while 26% said police should be routinely armed.

""Yet that is precisely what the internet - and the big companies that provide internet-based services - provide."" It was extraordinary in the aftermath of the recent attack, where facts remain unclear and where victims have not yet been named, for the Prime Minister to make such a political response. She continued: ""We need to work with allied, democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremism and terrorist planning. ""And we need to do everything we can at home to reduce the risks of extremism online."" She also posted her statement to Facebook, and the social media giant was the first to respond. You don't have to read between the lines to see that Facebook is not happy. The company believes that it already does a lot. Facebook's policy director wrote: ""Using a combination of technology and human review, we work aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it. ""If we become aware of an emergency involving imminent harm to someone's safety, we notify law enforcement. ""Online extremism can only be tackled with strong partnerships. We have long collaborated with policymakers, civil society, and others in the tech industry, and we are committed to continuing this important work together."" Sources at other technology companies are also keen to stress how much, in their view, they work with government. They were surprised to be singled out by the PM so quickly. ""Today isn't the day for a public row,"" one source told me. In her statement, the PM was driving at two different agendas: ""spreading extremism"" and ""planning attacks"". On the first, it is reasonable for tech companies to do a little more. Over the last few years, they've become much quicker at removing flagged videos and accounts. And here the Government's and the technology companies' interests are pretty aligned: social networks do not want harmful content on their sites - to keep both users, and advertisers, happy. The problem comes with content that is not obviously terrorist and thus illegal. When does free speech become extremism? The Government itself has struggled to define extremism legally, and technology companies are not going to be able to do any better. The second part - ""terrorist planning"" - is a reference to the problems posed by end-to-end encryption. Encryption keeps users secure but also makes it hard for governments to monitor communications. The issue is a long-running one. The Westminster and Manchester attacks brought it back to our attention. What is often missed is that the Government already has the legal powers to order companies to provide communications unencrypted. But it has never enforced them. That may well change now. And it will lead to a very big showdown indeed."

In the wake of Saturday's terror attack, which saw three attackers kill seven people and critically injure 18 in just eight minutes, Mrs May has come under increasing pressure over her time as home secretary. In a question and answer session on the campaign trail on Monday, Mrs May repeatedly refused to say she was wrong to cut police numbers while she was in the Home Office. The Prime Minister insisted that counter-terrorism policing budgets had been protected and that the Government had funded an increase in firearms officers. :: What we know about the London Bridge killers The Labour leader accused Mrs May of trying to ""protect the public on the cheap"" by cutting 20,000 police officers, despite a Police Federation warning over public safety. When asked if he would back calls for Mrs May's resignation, Mr Corbyn said: ""Indeed I would, because there's been calls made by a lot of very responsible people on this who are very worried that she was at the Home Office for all this time, presided over these cuts in police numbers and is now saying that we have a problem - yes, we do have a problem, we should never have cut the police numbers.""

Ms Dick has said that in the light of the changing terror threat, with thousands of people prepared to carry out ""low tech"" attacks, resources and strategy should be reviewed. She said that police and intelligence agencies had foiled 18 plots since 2013 - five in the last nine weeks - and that there was a ""high volume of people who want to attack us"". Ms Dick said she hoped the pace of the attacks in the last nine weeks would not become the ""new normal"". ""We have been, in many respects, extremely successful and we have built a very powerful machine but we have now seen these ghastly attacks in London and Manchester over the last several weeks. ""During that time we have also foiled another five plots so, yes, of course I think it is appropriate for us all to look at the amount of resource that the police have, both counter-terrorism police but also our neighbourhood officers. ""The majority of people who responded on Saturday night and are now keeping London safe aren't counter-terrorism police, they are general police."" Government figures show the number of police officers has fallen from 146,030 officers in 2010 to 126,766 in 2016 - the number of armed officers has dropped from 6,976 to 5,639 in the same time. However, in 2015 the Home Office did provide £148m for an extra 1,500 armed police officers by 2018. According to the National Police Chiefs' Council, there are 640 more armed police officers in 2017 than there were in 2016. Former counter-terrorism chief Jim Gamble said the ""blanket of austerity had excused all sorts of cuts"". In a blog for HuffPost UK, he wrote: ""No matter how you cut it, no matter what spin you put on diversification of resource or doing things differently, there are 20,000 fewer police now than there were in 2010. ""That's fewer eyes and ears on the street, fewer 'bobbies' building relationships, community confidence and critically creating that visible reassurance and deterrence that is key at times like this."""
2017-06-06,Donald Trump has doubled down on his criticism of Sadiq Khan in the wake of Saturday's terror attack in central London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170606043406/http://news.sky.com/story/trump-attacks-pathetic-excuse-by-sadiq-khan-after-terror-attack-10905312,"The US President accused the capital's mayor of giving a ""pathetic excuse"" for how he reassured Londoners after seven people were killed on London Bridge and in Borough Market. Mr Trump had written: ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM (mainstream media) is working hard to sell it!"" In response, a spokesman for Mr Khan said: ""The mayor is focused on dealing with Saturday's horrific and cowardly attack and working with the police, the emergency services and the Government to keep London safe."" During a news conference on Monday, the mayor even said that some state visits were ""welcome, some less so"" - a possible reference to Mr Trump's expected trip to the UK. After several repeated questions from journalists, Prime Minister Theresa May suggested at a campaign event that Trump had been wrong to criticise the mayor. Mr Khan's former Labour colleague in the Commons, David Lammy, had a less subtle response to the President. Mr Lammy wrote: ""You are truly beneath contempt. You are just a troll. Show some bottle please PM. Cancel the state visit and tell Trump where to get off. ""You demean your office by misquoting and smearing the Mayor of a city that has just been attacked and is also the capital of your close ally. ""You besmirch the presidency, you taint previous Presidents with your behaviour & you bring shame on your great country and its great people."" The war of words had began after the London mayor gave an interview on Sunday morning in which he urged people not to be frightened by an increased police presence. He had said: ""My message to Londoners and visitors to our great city is to be calm and vigilant today. You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers and uniformed officers. ""There is no reason to be alarmed by this. We are the safest global city in the world. ""You saw last night as a consequence of our planning, our preparation, the rehearsals that take place, the swift response from the emergency services tackling the terrorists and also helping the injured."" This had been followed by Mr Trump firing off an incendiary barrage of tweets attacking Mr Khan for his plea for calm - and promoting his contentious travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. Mr Khan's spokesperson had described the first round of presidential tweets as ""ill-informed"" - and said they had deliberately taken his remarks out of context. On Monday afternoon, the White House insisted Mr Trump was not picking a fight with the mayor - but just raising an issue of national security. Tensions between Westminster and the White House have been fraught for several weeks after intelligence gathered by the UK security services on the Manchester Arena attack was leaked to US media."

Eilidh was from Vatersay, which is connected by a causeway to the island of Barra, where her funeral was held. She had been in Manchester for the concert. The teenager's coffin was flown back to Traigh Mhor beach on Sunday, draped in the Barra flag.

They were inside a locked box stolen from the boot of a vehicle reported to have been used by Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale, who is head of counter-terrorism for West Midlands Police. So far, the force has refused to confirm or deny Mr Beale is the officer involved, or where the theft took place. It comes as the country remains on high alert after three terrorism attacks in three months, including two over the past fortnight. West Midlands Police spokesman Craig Hughes said: ""An investigation has been launched after items were stolen from a West Midlands Police officer's unmarked car. ""A number of personal items were taken during the theft along with a locked metal box that contained documents relating to police matters. The box was locked in the boot. ""The officer remains at work."" Labour West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said: ""There are active investigations under way. At the appropriate moment we will be holding West Midlands Police to account for this incident.""

Mrs Wadsworth's barrister, David Hislop QC, accused prosecutors of trying to portray her as ""salacious and predatory"", while, in reality, she was a ""professional public figure"". Urging jurors to try her on criminal charges, rather than for her morals, Mr Hislop said she she had merely been ""foolhardy"" and ""stupid"" after being ""flattered by the thought that young men found her attractive"". ""Unless you are Joan Collins or the president of France it's unusual to take a sexual partner half your age but it does happen."" While admitting some may find her actions ""abhorrent', he added: ""The wisdom of her judgement or morality in the late 1990s is quite irrelevant,"" he told the court. Summing up their defence, lawyers for both defendants addressed the jury at Warwick Crown Court, with Mr Wadsworth's counsel accusing the prosecution of hiding the weakness in their case by likening the couple's behaviour to ""some seedy Soho club"". Mr Hislop accused the Crown of ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"" by using a charity calendar featuring Mrs Wadsworth posing as Lady Godiva to suggest her career was based ""on the twang of a stocking"". He told the jury of five women and seven men: ""This (the calendar) was obviously part of a PR machine that undoubtedly drove ratings. ""This, I suggest, is an intelligent and sensible view of what all those publicity photographs were about. ""Why are they trying to force us to have this rather jaundiced and tabloid view of Julie Wadsworth? I suggest that their reason for it is shortcomings in their evidence."" Barrister Michelle Clarke, representing Mr Wadsworth, said the calendar photoshoot had been sanctioned by the BBC, and amounted to Mrs Wadsworth wearing fancy dress at work. Miss Clarke said one of the alleged victims had been allowed into the Wadsworths' ""private moment"" in the deepest, most hidden part of a wooded area. ""They didn't want to demonstrate in front of others like some seedy Soho club,"" the lawyer added."

""Perhaps the most ominous signal emanating from the data... is that contributors still expect house prices to increase at a faster pace than wages over the medium term despite the difficulty many first time buyers are clearly having in taking their first steps onto the property ladder,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said. RICS said demand, new instructions and sales all fell in May, with price growth easing too. Fewer homes were put up for sale and the average number of properties on estate agents' books was just 43, it said. Surveyors reported the biggest slide in listings since the wake of the Brexit vote last year. RICS said a ""sheer lack of supply continues to support prices for the time being"". It said ""little change"" was expected in the market during the next three months, but there was slightly more optimism looking ahead to the next 12 months with surveyors anticipating sales to increase. Earlier this week, Halifax said there had been ""virtually no change"" in house prices over the last three months, though house prices rose by 0.4% in May for the first time in five months to reach £220,706 on average across the UK. Contrasting figures from rival lender Nationwide earlier this month showed house prices had fallen for three consecutive months for the first time since 2009. Last week, the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for home buyers fell to a seven-month low in April, in a further sign that the housing market may be slowing. The National Association of Estate Agents said buyers and sellers were taking a ""wait and see"" approach."

Speaking after losing his seat, the ex-Lib Dem leader said he had never ""shirked a fight"" but conceded: ""You live by the sword, you die by the sword."" In a constituency dominated by two universities, Mr Clegg appeared to have finally paid the price for infamously reneging on his 2010 election pledge to block tuition fee increases. The ardent pro-European warned there was an ""agonising"" future ahead for the next Government as it seeks to unite a divided country. Alex Salmond, who led the SNP into the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, lost his Gordon seat to the Conservatives. The former Scottish First Minister won 19,254 votes, but was beaten by Conservative Colin Clark on 21,861. He admitted the results had been a ""grievous blow"" for the SNP, but said his colleagues should use their influence at Westminster to ""build a progressive alliance"" and keep Theresa May out of Downing Street. Rising Conservative star Ben Gummer - one of the architects of Theresa May's widely-panned manifesto - lost by 831 votes in Ipswich. The Cabinet Office minister and son of former agriculture minister John Gummer - who had been defending a 3,733 majority - lost the seat to Labour's Sandy Martin. The SNP's leader in the Commons Angus Robertson was defending a majority of nearly 10,000 in Moray. But Nicola Sturgeon's deputy - one of the most consistent PMQs performers since 2015 - went down to Tory Douglas Ross. Mr Robertson said: ""It seems to me there's a lot of change going on.

Labour are projected to win between 260 and 266 seats - more than under both Ed Miliband and Gordon Brown. Such a result would throw plans for Brexit negotiations to start this month into chaos, with the parties having to enter negotiations over who will form a government. :: Live updates on election night Yet another night of high political drama began at 10pm when a broadcasters' exit poll suggested an election designed to strengthen Mrs May's hand - and increase her working majority of 17 - could in fact do the opposite. Her u-turn on calling a snap election appears to have spectacularly backfired, with former chancellor George Osborne describing the exit poll figures as ""completely catastrophic"". The woman who fired him a year ago is now facing questions over her own political future. In a sombre speech after retaining her Maidenhead seat, Mrs May refused to answer question from Sky's Kay Burley about whether she would resign. :: Comprehensive results service: National maps and who won each seat She then told supporters: ""The country needs a period of stability and whatever the results are the Conservative party will fulfil our duty of ensuring that stability so we can all go forward together.""

""I would have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all the people of this country."" Prior to the election Mrs May declared that losing just six seats would put Mr Corbyn in charge of negotiating the country's exit from the EU. :: Pound plunges after shock exit poll It is far from clear at this stage whether that will happen - while the prospect of yet another election could also be raised. In Scotland, both Labour and the Tories have made gains on a bad night for the SNP, with the exit poll suggesting the party would end up with just 34 MPs - down 22. Former leader Alex Salmond is among the most high-profile names who won't be returning to Westminster after losing to the Tories. Angus Robertson, SNP leader in the Commons, also lost. For the Lib Dems, former deputy PM Nick Clegg lost his Sheffield Hallam seat, though overall the party looked set to make gains. They have ruled out joining any coalition. UKIP is projected to win no seats, casting doubt on the future of leader Paul Nuttall, who himself came a distance third in the Brexit heartland of Boston and Skegness.

When news of his potential connection to London emerged, he left the neighbourhood and has not been seen for days. His material is a well-known inspiration to Islamic State fighters and extremists, including, reportedly, London terror attack ringleader Khuram Butt. Jibril, whose work is still widely available online, has previously been to prison for fraud. But authorities have also been concerned about his hardline views on religion, and his neighbours report regular visits from the police. ""He is still loose,"" said a man who lived two doors down but didn't want to give his name. ""Of course I worry. ""We have kids to worry about."" Another, who confided that he had spoken to the police about Jibril but did not know if anything had ever come of it, said: ""The FBI or whoever came over. ""I don't know what is going on. ""It is up to authorities to do something if he is dangerous."" The pair discussed how Jibril would circle around the street on the bike but hardly ever interacted with the residents. A mother living on the opposite side of the road said: ""People talk around here. ""People said he was with ISIS, in prison … he was scary."" Razi Jafri got to know Jibril through a university Muslim association but became worried about his hardline ideas. Mr Jafri eventually left a message with Jibril telling him he was not welcome to speak at campus events anymore. He said: ""It was just a kind of general intolerance not just for people outside the Muslim faith but within it too. ""This was in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and we were trying to promote understanding and spiritual and social growth. ""Jibril threatened that."" Any possible connection to the London attack is particularly hard for Dearborn to bear. It is home to America's largest Arab population and is often held up as a model of unity and co-operation in the fight against extremism. In part that is due to the deep and hard-won ties between local police and community leaders. Dearborn police chief Ron Haddad described how his department's outreach programme could well have saved lives. He said that there had been five cases of families turning their own children in when they had been veering towards violence or even a full-blown terror attack. Early intervention meant that each potential offender was given the help they needed to recover, with a particular focus on mental health. He said: ""What works here might not work perfectly everywhere else, but I will tell you that people in this community report crimes to us every single day. ""I think we do lead the nation with community policing, it has been recognised countless times. ""The vast majority of people in this country are good people and they want to be a part of the solution."" Nearby, at one of America's largest mosques, Kassem Allie reflected on a fight his congregation cannot afford to lose. He said: ""Extremism of any type is about division. ""We need to be resilient. ""We are vigilant because we are aware that whatever happens in our community will affect us first and foremost. ""It is in our own best interests to counter that message."""

He said: ""The explanations confused me and increasingly concerned me."" Mr Comey repeatedly said he believed he was fired because of his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to swing the elections. Then referring to the President's comments about the FBI being in disarray and poorly led, Mr Comey said: ""The administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI. ""Those were lies, plain and simple."" Mr Comey said that he kept detailed memos of his meetings and calls with Donald Trump because he was ""honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting"". He added he ""knew there would come a day"" he would need a contemporaneous account of the interactions because he was so uncomfortable about Mr Trump's requests for his loyalty. He said the President asked him to drop an investigation in to former national security adviser Mike Flynn, and to ""lift the cloud"" of the Russia investigation. He revealed that he believed Mr Trump was not asking but directing him to drop an active criminal investigation in to Flynn's contacts with Russia at a time when Flynn was in ""legal jeopardy"". Mr Comey would not answer questions on whether that amounted to obstruction of justice. But he said that he was ""stunned by the conversation"". In an explosive revelation, Mr Comey said that when Mr Trump tweeted of the possible existence of tapes of their conversations, he directed a ""good friend"" to leak the content of his memos to a journalist. His reason for doing so was to prompt the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the investigation in to whether Mr Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. I'm pretty sure that Comey's testimony put his own ""character"" on trial. Leaks, admitted weakness, Lynch double standard. Come on now. https://t.co/BHBk83NFhd He added: ""Lordy, I hope there are tapes."" At the same time, speaking in Washington in front of the Faith and Freedom Coalition (FCC), Mr Trump said he takes elections seriously and will do everything to ensure they will be conducted without interference from anyone. Remaining defiant, he said to the room full of supporters: ""We're under siege... But we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever. You watch."" He went on to say he believed the entrenched interests in Washington are against him but that ""we will not back down from doing what is right"". In May Robert Mueller was appointed as a special counsel. Mr Comey said he believed Donald Trump's repeated discussions about his employment was an effort to ""get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job"". He said things became awkward with the President after he asked for his loyalty because ""he was asking for something and I was refusing to give it."" Mr Comey also told the committee that he had ""no doubt"" about Russia interfering in America's elections.

""We remain that shining city on the hill, and they don't like it.""

This is what America rallied against, but the DC elite don't get it or know any other way."" In a White House press briefing a spokeswoman said that President Trump was not a liar and that she was offended by the question. Mr Trump's lawyer has said that the President never demanded ""loyalty"" from Mr Comey or told him to ""let Flynn go"".

2017-06-08,Around 30 million voters are going to the polls in the General Election called by Theresa May just over seven weeks ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170609024252/http://news.sky.com/story/general-election-2017-millions-of-voters-head-to-the-polls-10907926,"Polling stations all over the UK are open from 7am until 10pm on Thursday, with the results being declared overnight and throughout Friday. Polling day follows a frantic dash for votes in the final 24 hours of campaigning by the Prime Minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. Mrs May campaigned across England in five constituencies; in London, Southampton, Norfolk, Nottinghamshire and Birmingham. :: Vote 2017: When will you know the result? Mr Corbyn made six campaign visits, to Glasgow, Runcorn, Colwyn Bay, Watford and Harrow before ending up in Islington, north London. Mr Farron also clocked up six visits, to Solihull, St. Albans, Twickenham, Carshalton, Bath and Oxford. But many voters have already cast their vote. It is estimated that by the time the polls close about one in five of the electorate will have cast a postal vote. This is the first time since 1992 that a General Election has been a stand-alone event without local elections being held on the same day, which should speed up counting on Thursday night. It is also the first UK General Election where campaigning has been halted by terrorist attacks. It was halted for three days after the Manchester bombing last month and for a day after the London Bridge attack. The snap poll was called by the Prime Minister in a shock announcement on 18 April, the day MPs returned to Westminster after Easter. Some 650 seats in the House of Commons are being contested, 553 in England, 59 in Scotland, 40 in Wales and 18 in Northern Ireland. To win a overall Commons majority, a party needs to win 326 seats. At the last General Election in 2015, David Cameron won a majority of 12 for the Conservatives after five years leading a Coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. Turnout in 2015 was 66.2%. The Conservatives won 37.7% of the votes and 330 seats, Labour 31.2% and 232 seats, UKIP 12.9% and one seat and the Liberal Democrats 8.1% and eight seats. But Mr Cameron then quit as Prime Minister immediately after the UK voted to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June last year and he was succeeded by Mrs May last July. In this election there are fewer candidates, 3,306, than in any General Election since 1992, largely because UKIP and the Greens have stood aside in certain constituencies. UKIP is fighting 378 seats, 246 fewer than in 2015, and the Greens 468, 105 fewer than two years ago."

2017-06-08,Premier League bosses have backed changes to club ownership rules that will make it easier to block potentially unscrupulous investors in the wake of controversies surrounding takeovers at Hull City and Southampton.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170609024252/http://news.sky.com/story/premier-league-bosses-approve-tougher-club-ownership-rules-10908980,"Sky News has learnt that the 20 club chairmen voted unanimously to approve changes to the Premier League's Owners and Directors Test at its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. The move will have the effect of enhancing the League's ability to block new owners in a bid to preserve the integrity of the competition, which is watched by billions of people globally every season. A source said that the chairmen had voted to give the Premier League ""the power to impose such conditions as it sees fit in order to ensure compliance with PL Rules on finance, Owners and Directors Test, disclosure of ownership issues and associations and influence"". New ""disqualifying events"" in relation to the ownership test would include a failure to provide all relevant information, or the provision of false, misleading or inaccurate information about a prospective new owner's finances, according to the source. For the first time, the Premier League's rules will also allow it to block a new owner where they have ""engaged in conduct outside the UK that would constitute an offence… if such conduct had taken place in the UK, whether or not such conduct resulted in a conviction"". Sources told Sky News last month that that amendment to the rule book had been partly inspired by a move by Chinese businessman Gao Jisheng to take control of Southampton FC in a deal reported to be worth £200m. Mr Gao had admitted to bribery offences, but gave evidence for the prosecution in two separate cases, meaning that he escaped charges himself. Because he has not been convicted of an offence, the Premier League is understood to have had no existing grounds to block his bid. The changes to the Owners and Directors Test follow growing unease - both in football and in Westminster - about the influx of club owners who have often sought to keep details of their financial affairs beyond the scrutiny of the Premier League. There have also been growing objections to the number of clubs being bought by Chinese backers amid suggestions that there is a degree of opacity surrounding the ultimate ownership of some of those investors. Roughly three-quarters of the 20 Premier League clubs are foreign-owned, including new champions Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Aston Villa, Reading, Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion are among the prominent English clubs now owned by Chinese shareholders. Controversy erupted over an attempt by Dai Yongge and Hawken Xiu Li, his sister, to buy Hull City after a third party involved in the transaction insisted that he controlled the relevant funds necessary to undertake the deal. It subsequently transpired that the finances were actually under the control of Mr Dai, with the Financial Times reporting earlier this year that a Premier League investigation into him had raised several ""red flags"" over his commercial background. Mr Dai has since acquired Reading, who missed out on promotion to the Premier League in the Championship Play-Off Final when they lost to Huddersfield Town. The Premier League's rules already permitted close scrutiny of the finances of club-owners whose business plans are deemed to be unsustainable by the Premier League. Clubs are permitted to overspend their budgets by £105m over a three-year period, providing they can demonstrate the viability of their financial forecasts, or that directors and financiers are prepared to write off their debts. One source said this area was also likely to be tightened, although the League already powers to impose draconian measures such as a transfer embargo. The Premier League had previously made incremental changes to what was known as the 'Fit and Proper Person Test' in the decade since Alexandre Gaydamak's tenure at Portsmouth led to the club's financial ruin. The Premier League could not be reached for comment on Thursday."

2017-06-08,Profits at Sir Philip Green's retail empire plummeted by 79% last year as it took a hit from the closure of BHS and a tough fashion market.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170609024252/http://news.sky.com/story/sir-philip-greens-retail-empire-sees-profits-plunge-79-10908161,"The company said competition from new fashion retailers and a squeeze on household budgets, with people cutting back on shopping for new clothes, contributed to the poor performance. Accounts filed at Companies House for Taveta Investments - which owns Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Burton parent firm Arcadia - show pre-tax profits slumped from £172.2m to £36.8m in the year to 27 August 2016. The figures include a £26.4m exceptional cost relating to BHS and other one-off charges relating to ""onerous leases"" on the group's properties, Taveta said. The BHS department store chain plunged into administration just over a year ago, triggering around 11,000 job losses and leaving 19,000 staff facing shortfalls in their retirement earnings. In February, Sir Philip, agreed to pay £363m to settle the BHS pension scheme - significantly less than the £571m pension deficit the firm was left with when it went bust in April last year. Speaking about the latest figures, Taveta said: ""The retail industry continues to experience a period of major change as customers become ever more selective and value conscious and advances in technology open up more diverse, fast-changing and complex sales channels. ""Clothing has also become a less important part of the household budget."" The firm also pointed to Brexit for causing economic uncertainty and the collapse in the value of the pound following last year's vote to leave the European Union. ""The group's financial performance is below prior year levels including a significant additional charge on its trading results through the deterioration of currency exchange rates. ""The group is looking at initiatives to improve margin to offset the ongoing impact of weaker sterling."" Sir Philip has reportedly brought in management consultants McKinsey & Co to help with online sales."

But in the moments after the Conservatives were predicted to be the largest party, but with fewer MPs, the currency dived to around $1.2730 - its lowest point since the election was called in April. The result would plunge domestic politics into turmoil and could delay Brexit talks - inflicting months of further uncertainty on businesses and financial markets. :: LIVE: Exit poll predicts no majority for May Sky News Economics Editor Ed Conway said: ""Yet again there's been another shock to the system. ""Traders out there who were nervous about that exit poll but thought there was going to be an overall majority - you can see what they're doing, they're selling the pound.""

If she fails to win a majority, her position as Conservative leader could be called into question - raising the prospect of another election later in the year. A Jeremy Corbyn-led government would be likely to rattle financial markets further after the veteran socialist's manifesto pledged a corporation tax hike and income tax rises for the UK's richest 5%. Labour promised to push ahead with Brexit but said it would scrap the PM's plan and prioritise keeping the benefits of the EU single market and customs union."

Twenty-two people were killed in the atrocity, which took place as fans were leaving the show. The youngest was eight years old. The One Love event, held on Sunday, featured performances from artists including Katy Perry, Justin Bieber and Coldplay, with a surprise appearance from Manchester's own Liam Gallagher. It raised more than £2.7m for the British Red Cross We Love Manchester Fund, taking the total past £10m by Monday. The fund was established for the victims of the concert attack and their families. Those who attended Grande's original show were offered free tickets and some injured fans left their hospital beds to attend. The star also visited victims of the attack in hospital. Some 50,000 people attended the concert. Many in the crowd were moved to tears by performances that included a duet between Grande and local schoolchildren. It took place less than 24 hours after a knife and vehicle attack killed at least eight people at London Bridge, the second major incident to hit the UK in as many weeks. Enhanced security was added in response to the potential threat, but organisers expressed defiance in the face of further attacks. ""The only thing we can do now is choose how we let this affect us and how we live our lives from here on out,"" Grande said in a statement on Twitter. ""Music is meant to heal us, to bring us together, to make us happy. So that is what it will continue to do for us."" Grande's single One More Time was also re-released following the attack, with some of the proceeds going towards the Red Cross Fund.

A hung parliament of the kind produced by the 2010 election must surely throw the Prime Minister's preferred Brexit timetable into doubt. ::What happens if there is a hung parliament? First, a government may not be in place by 19 June, when detailed negotiations with Brussels' chief negotiator Michel Barnier are due to begin. And if there is to be another General Election later this year or early next year, the whole two-year plan for Brexit could be wrecked. Justifying her decision to call a ""Brexit election"", the PM said back in April: ""The country is coming together, but Westminster is not."" And accusing the Opposition parties of ""political game playing"", she said: ""Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country."" Well, if the exit poll is anywhere near correct, Westminster is going to be more divided than it was before Mrs May took her gamble. Veteran Europhile Ken Clarke, breaking his silence after a three-month illness that required heart surgery, almost appeared to be gloating when he said: ""Perhaps a little more cross-party discussion, particularly on Brexit, and a little less shouting slogans."" And Lord Newby, the Lib Dems' leader in the Lords has told Sky News that those who disagree with the Tories' Brexit approach ""will be emboldened"". They certainly will. And perhaps some of those MPs who voted for Article 50 in the Commons and the Lords back in March now regret doing so. :: Election results in full: Live vote share and seat changes In the palaces and chancelleries of Europe - not to mention in Brussels - the presidents, prime ministers and European Commission bureaucrats will no doubt be chortling with uncontrolled glee at the humiliation that Mrs May could be heading for. One can imagine the thirsty Jean-Claude Juncker pouring himself another large Cognac and Germany's Angela Merkel quaffing another of those huge beers she swigged at a campaign event just 11 days ago. Throughout the election campaign, the PM has repeated over and over again that Brexit negotiations begin just 11 days after the General Election. In her final rally of the campaign, in Birmingham on Wednesday, she said it again and claimed once more that only she could offer the ""strong and stable leadership to get the best deal in Europe"". The other Brexit slogan she kept repeating during the campaign was that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". With the benefit of hindsight, she perhaps should have been careful what she wished for. It was the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Monsieur Barnier, who set 19 June as his favoured date for the start of Brexit talks, which are due to last around 14-18 months. There is no reason why that could not be postponed. But if that happens the negotiations will have to be speeded up. That's because the date of Britain's departure from the EU is due to take place exactly two years after the triggering of the Article 50 Brexit process, on 29 March, 2019 - whether or not a withdrawal deal has been reached. Under the terms of Article 50 of the EU treaties, the two-year deadline for the UK to leave the union can be extended only with the agreement of the other 27 member states. :: General Election results in full :: LIVE: Sky's Election blog The European Council president, Donald Tusk, has said he believes Article 50 can be reversed. But Theresa May has insisted there is no turning back. In one of her most colourful claims during the election campaign, the PM said: ""Jeremy Corbyn's minders can put him into a smart blue suit for an interview with Jeremy Paxman. ""But with his position on Brexit, he will find himself alone and naked in the negotiating chamber of the European Union."" Suddenly - even though it's only an exit poll and few election results have been declared - two possibilities have opened up. One is that it might be Mr Corbyn and not her in the negotiating chamber of the EU, even if he leads a minority government, which is a possibility, if the exit poll is anywhere near accurate. And the other is that she will look very exposed when she sets foot into the negotiations."

The inquest is looking at whether the 44-year-old businessman was poisoned or died of natural causes. The married father-of-two emitted strange green-yellow bile as he was given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in an attempt to revive him. Russ Whitworth, claims and underwriting director at lead insurer Legal & General, told the inquest Mr Perepilichnyy made multiple life insurance applications between 17 June and 4 July 2012. He said had they all been successful the total amount would have been £8.5m. The inquest heard Legal & General granted a £2m policy, while Mr Perepilichnyy had held an existing policy with London Victoria. Mr Perepilichnyy applied to AIG for three other life insurance policies totalling £5m in June 2012, but the insurance firm asked that medical tests were carried out. John Begg QC, representing the Russian's widow Tatiana Perepilichnaya, questioned the motives of Legal & General. He said over four years the company's lawyers had advanced ""florid theories"", including that Mr Perepilichnyy could have been murdered, with a poisonous vegetable being slipped into his sorrel soup. ""In one hearing (there was) a reference to security services, creating a kind of John le Carre scenario,"" the barrister said, as he asked Mr Whitworth: ""Do you think it is a responsible thing to do?"" When the witness appeared to smile, Mr Begg said: ""It's not actually so funny for the children of Mrs Perepilichnaya who have had to endure the media coverage."" Mr Whitworth said: ""I do regret any upset to the family,"" adding: ""I think what I need to say here is I'm only the claims and underwriting director for Legal & General and not a spokesman for the company."" Mrs Perepilichnaya had said her husband applied for the insurance policies to help secure a mortgage as they were both keen to buy an expensive property, the inquest heard. They had considered homes in Chelsea in west London and St George's Hill in Surrey, and had looked at a particular property worth £7.8m, it was told. The hearing continues."

Captain Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, died along with James Male, 22, from Southampton, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56, both from Somerset. The search for the yacht was called off after two days but reinstated after lobbying from the men's families and the British government. Standing trial on four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence, Douglas Innes is accused of choosing an ""unsafe"" route for the yacht because it was shorter and would get the vessel back to Britain in time for bookings. The prosecution told the court the yacht had been grounded three times in three years - but it had not been properly inspected. It is said to have had a fault with bolts that should have secured the keel to the hull. Nigel Lickley QC said the Cheeki Rafiki was not licensend to sail solo more than 60 miles from a ""safe haven"". He said that when Innes, who ran Stormforce Coaching Limited, got an email marked ""Urgent"" from the crew explaining the yacht was taking on water, he carried on drinking in a pub. ""There he received a telephone call directly from the yacht,"" Mr Lickley said. ""It was Andrew Bridge calling from the Cheeki Rafiki saying the situation was getting worse."" The prosecutor said the yacht ""hadn't been looked after considering the work it was required to do, months - in fact, years - of hard racing from early 2011 without from any point thereafter being inspected by an expert to ensure she was safe to use"".

2017-06-08,Automated social media accounts are proving more subtle during the 2017 General Election compared to other campaigns.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170609024252/http://news.sky.com/story/invisible-election-social-media-bots-proving-low-key-in-2017-10907641,"""Bots"" are Twitter accounts set up to tweet automatically according to algorithms, while ""botnets"" are large, linked networks of bots which tweet similar messages simultaneously. Research between Sky News and the Centre for Analysis of Social Media (CASM) uncovered previously unknown botnets tweeting during the 2017 General Election. But the work also found very few Twitter accounts had tweeted at ""super-human speeds"". High-volume tweeters - whether human or bot - also tended to espouse more left-wing messages, according to the research. Josh Smith, a researcher at CASM, told Sky News: ""The botnets we picked up were tweeting the same thing at the same time - that's very stupid. ""Bots which tweet hundreds of thousands of times a day are very easy to pick up. They can be very effective at shutting down debate… but we have not seen that kind of activity in this election. ""What we're interested in is botnets that have the ability to be extremely clever in the way they behave. ""If you're trying to be a real person… you need to employ quite sophisticated tactics to convince you are indeed just concerned about [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn or politics in Britain."" Pinpointing who controls bots is tricky. Philip Howard, professor of internet studies at the Oxford Internet Institute, said: ""It's tough to say where the bots come from. ""We know, depending on the country, between 10 to 20% of all the social media traffic over Twitter is driven by these highly automated accounts. ""We know some of them originate in Russia, we know others originate in the US, and there's plenty of home-grown bots here in the UK."" The low-key impact of bots during the 2017 General Election contrasts with a less subtle, more sledge-hammer approach seen in other countries. In 2014, the Mexican government used around 75,000 automatic accounts to tweet spam material and drown hashtags used to organise protests with a huge volume of useless posts. And when Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was assassinated in 2015, fake stories began circulating that his killers were Ukrainian. Those messages were supercharged by 2,900 bots all tweeting the same messages. Mr Howard said: ""We call it computational propaganda. ""It's the combination for a computer programme which gets a message out to thousands and thousands of users with some junk news or some fake facts that have been made up that try to poison conversations."" But less obvious bots may be more effective. During the recent French presidential elections, coordinated human accounts - combined with small-scale bots - helped boost the National Front's social media impact. Mr Smith told Sky News: ""One of our worries is what is being called automated activity is quite often just people who are excited about a cause. ""And this has especially been true for [Donald] Trump and [Marine] Le Pen - it's the side of people who think they have something to gain in an election, on the cusp of historic victory."""

The families of the London attackers have condemned their actions on Wednesday, with relatives of Khuram Butt, Youssef Zaghba and the ex-partner of Rachid Redouane saying they were shocked at what had happened. Also, footage emerged online appearing to show the moment armed police gunned down the three knife-wielding terrorists. There were more than 100 people injured in the Manchester and London attacks combined."
2017-06-08,"A former head of UK counter-terrorism once told me his job was a bit like playing the video game Space Invaders, in which the player has to zap aliens moving down the screen at ever-increasing speed.  ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170609024252/http://news.sky.com/story/security-services-must-reveal-what-was-known-about-terror-attackers-10907122,"He said: ""You're busy dealing with the ones you can see in front of you, then lots more appear from nowhere."" A simple but vivid description of the scale of the threat posed to the UK public. The police and MI5 say they have 500 current joint terror investigations under way, involving around 3,000 suspects. On top of that there are another 20,000 suspects who have been investigated in the past but are no longer thought to be active, though they might still pose a risk. :: London Bridge attack: Body found in Thames :: The victims of the London terror attack You can't arrest and prosecute them all, of course, nor can you put more than a handful under constant surveillance, but there is legislation through which they can be controlled if there is evidence to show a serious risk to the public. None of the measures appear to have been applied to the five terrorists who carried out the three attacks on Westminster Bridge, the Manchester Arena and London Bridge, even though they were all, to varying degrees, on the radar of our security forces. In 2005, to replace emergency detention legislation introduced after the 9/11 attacks in the United States, the Labour government introduced control orders, a measure that was controversial from the start. Ten suspects released from detention in Belmarsh Prison were immediately put under the orders, which allowed restrictions on items they could possess and use, where they lived and travelled, whom they spoke to and, in some cases, involved electronic tagging. Critics described the orders as ""prison without bars"" and court challenges led to some being revoked. In 2012 the Tory government - with Theresa May as home secretary - replaced control orders with terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPIMs). Some said they were simply the old orders under a different name, while others described them as control orders-lite. They were less restrictive and withdrew the power to force a suspect to live up to 200 miles from their home, though Mrs May reintroduced that measure in 2015. We don't know why such legislation was not used against the killers before they struck and whether it could have prevented their attacks. Police and MI5 are reviewing what they knew and did about Manchester Arena bomber, Salman Abedi, and the Prime Minister has said she expects a similar analysis of the London Bridge attackers. Let's hope it's done and is published in full. We know that Khuram Butt was under police and MI5 investigation, but his priority was later reduced. Italian citizen Youssef Zaghba was flagged up to the UK by the Italians as a suspected jihadi, and Rachid Redouane appears to have used an immigration loophole to get into Britain after being refused asylum. Whatever your politics - and whatever her record in slashing police numbers - no one will disagree with the Prime Minister's words this week: ""Enough is enough."""
2017-06-08,"Whether it's crunching the numbers as the results come in, analysing voting trends, taking the key players to task or providing a real-time picture of the make-up of the country, Sky News has got election night covered.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170609024252/http://news.sky.com/story/vote-2017-key-results-as-they-happen-10909049,"Here are the key moments so far (and we'll update these throughout the night): :: 10pm - Polls have closed Counting in the 2017 General Election is under way. The exit poll shows the Conservatives projected to win 314 seats, making them the largest party but without enough for a majority in the Commons (they need 326). Labour would be on 266 seats, the SNP 34 seats and the Lib Dems on 14 seats. UKIP would have no seats. :: 11pm - The first constituency has declared Newcastle Upon Tyne Central is the first to declare this year. Labour candidate Chi Onwurah has held the seat with a majority of just under 15,000. Turnout was 66.8%. Houghton and Sunderland South was close behind, and the seat was held by Labour's Bridget Phillipson. Turnout was 61%, up from 56.3% in 2015. The slick counting operation means the city's two other constituencies, Washington and Sunderland West and Sunderland Central may be the next to declare - also, they hope, within an hour. So what comes next? :: From 12am - The early results The North East will dominate the early declarations, with constituencies in Durham as well as Sunderland prominent. :: 1am - First marginal seat declares All constituency declaration times are approximate, but the outcome of the first marginal seat will be known around 1am. Nuneaton, in Warwickshire, is seen as a bellwether seat, having flipped between Conservative and Labour but the Tories had a 4,882 majority in 2015. The then prime minister David Cameron said he knew he had won when his party held Nuneaton. :: 1.30am - Vale of Clwyd Another early marginal that may point the way to the overall result, the north Wales seat was won by the Conservatives by just 237 votes in 2015 and is a key Labour target. :: 2am - Declarations begin to pile up Around 20 constituencies will declare before 2am, but thereafter the announcements come thick and fast. :: 2.30am - Islington North Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's London constituency declares around this time. :: 3am - More declarations The next two hours are the busiest for results to be announced. The Conservative-held Welsh seat of Gower, which has the smallest current majority - just 27 votes - is due around now. :: 4am - Maidenhead Conservative leader Theresa May has held the Berkshire seat since it was created in 1997. She will have a good idea about whether she is still Prime Minister by now. :: 4.30am - City of Chester Labour's most marginal seat, the City of Chester, where the majority is 93, is due to declare. :: 5am - Boston and Skegness A big moment for UKIP, whose leader Paul Nuttall is standing in an area which voted heavily for Brexit. :: 6am - Morecambe and Lunesdale The North West coastal seat will be among the last to declare. Concession? Traditionally, the winning party leader waits until the loser concedes before declaring victory. That concession can come any time, but the leader of the losing party will often head back to party HQ first. In his resignation speech after losing in 2015, the then Labour chief Ed Miliband revealed he had called Mr Cameron to concede defeat. Candidates A total of 3,306 candidates are standing in the 2017 General Election - fewer than any election since 1992. In 2015, there were 3,971. The most significant reduction this year is the number of UKIP (down 246) and Green Party (down 105) candidates. A record 983 women candidates are also standing this year - up from 947 in 2015, when a record 191 women were elected to Parliament. The larger number of female candidates is partly down to the selection process, which has been more controlled by the main parties than in previous years, but also because of the short amount of time to select candidates. Labour leads the way with 256 female candidates, up 43 from 2015. The Conservatives have 182 - up 14 - and the Lib Dems are up 20 with 184 female candidates this year.

2017-06-08,The exit poll predicts that the Conservatives will be the largest party but will not have a majority which means there will be a hung parliament.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170609024252/http://news.sky.com/story/hung-parliament-how-a-government-would-be-formed-if-there-is-no-majority-10909125,"So what does that mean for the next five years? What is a hung parliament? A hung parliament happens when no party has the 326 seats needed for the majority that allows them to govern outright. A coalition generally needs more than 326 MPs in order to govern successfully, but, as Sinn Fein opts not to take their seats in the UK parliament, the number required can sometimes be smaller. What happens immediately after all the results are in? Protocol means that the previous government generally remains in place while there is a period of negotiation while discussions take place to form a coalition. Following the General Election in 2010, when no party had a majority, Gordon Brown remained as prime minister while the talks were taking place. :: General Election results in full :: LIVE: Sky's Election blog It can take several weeks before parties strike an agreement to form a coalition. If the incumbent government is unable to form a coalition big enough to rule, they may either resign and the largest opposition party may be invited to form a government, or they may try to continue to govern as a minority government. In 2010, once talks between David Cameron's Conservatives and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats had been going for some time, Gordon Brown realised he would be unable to form a majority government and resigned, paving the way for David Cameron to become prime minister. Does the Prime Minister have to resign? The Prime Minister only has to resign if it is clear they cannot command a majority of the House of Commons on votes of confidence or supply. :: Election results in full: Live vote share and seat changes A confidence and supply agreement happens when a party or member of parliament agree to support the government on motions of confidence. If a party can garner enough support to prevent them losing a motion of confidence, they can usually govern as a minority government but they may have some difficulty getting legislation through parliament unless they can win support of MPs outside their own party. What happens if there is no overall control? There were a number of occasions in the 20th Century when there has been no overall control. In 1923, the Conservative Party lost their majority and were unable to form a coalition. The party, led by Stanley Baldwin, stumbled on for nine months before they lost a vote on the King's speech in January 1924. The Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald then took office and governed as a minority administration until October of that year when that government too was defeated. It resulted in another election that was won by the Conservatives, with a much increased majority. In February 1974, the incumbent Conservative administration lost its majority. Edward Heath, who was four seats behind Harold Wilson's Labour Party, remained prime minister for a few days while he tried to form a coalition. He failed, leaving Mr Wilson to form a government but without a majority. He, like the government in 1923, carried on for a short time (seven months), before another election took place, which resulted in a Labour majority of three. With such a small majority, Labour was able to govern but by 1977 it had to draw on the support of the Liberals and a pact was formed that lasted until May 1978. What will happen this time if there is a hung parliament? A coalition looks unlikely at this stage as the Liberal Democrats have ruled out working with either party. The Conservatives will look to work with the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland but that still may not give them a working majority. Even if Labour forms a pact with the Scottish National Party, they may also not have enough to form even a minority government. If no party is able to command a majority on the basis of confidence and supply, the parties may have no choice but to call for another General Election."

The three terrorists were dead - eight minutes after they drove their van into London Bridge and started stabbing anyone they could find. They killed eight people and injured 48. Police said on Wednesday night that they had arrested another three men, meaning that they are now questioning five men in connection with the attack. All were arrested in Ilford, east London, one on drugs charges and two on terrorism charges. The families of the three London attackers have condemned their actions. Charisse O'Leary, the former partner of attacker Rachid Redouane, said she had ""shed many tears"" for those caught up in the attack.

During the hearing at Manchester Civil Justice, a map was shown which pinpointed where each victim was at the time of the 22 May blast. The nearest was just five yards from Abedi, 22, while the furthest was 20 metres away. Nineteen died at the scene while three were rushed to hospital and pronounced dead shortly afterwards, the inquests were told. Detective superintendent Jonathan Chadwick said Abedi's device was ""designed to kill and maim indiscriminately the largest number of innocent people"". At the time of the explosion, the foyer near Victoria Station was full of people making their way out following a concert by Ariana Grande, he added. Of the 220 people who received medical treatment, a number sustained life-changing injuries and some remain critically ill. Providing an update on Greater Manchester Police's investigation, Detective Superintendent Chadwick said 32 addresses had been searched and 10 were still under police control. Three people remain in custody and police are examining ""significant evidence"" found in a car linked to Abedi. Concluding the inquests, coroner Nigel Meadows paid tribute to the ""truly unbelievable dignity and strength of spirit that all the bereaved families have demonstrated in the face of such overwhelming grief"". Mr Meadows said there were ""too many to list"" who worked ""behind the scenes"" to assist and treat those injured in the attack. He also praised the ""tremendous"" work done by Greater Manchester Police crime scene management officers, police family liaison officers, mortuary staff and forensic pathologists. Mr Meadows said: ""The response to this tragic incident has been a complete and total team effort from all."" Prior to the hearing, which none of the families of the deceased attended, a minute's silence was held for those affected by the bombing and also the London Bridge atrocity. An inquest into Abedi's death will be opened at a later date."

Labour directly courted the youth vote with the promise to scrap tuition fees and increase the minimum wage in their anti-austerity manifesto. :: LIVE: Hung parliament - latest updates from General Election 2017 :: Hung parliament: What happens when no one wins? A backlash against last year's EU referendum result and concerns over a Tory-led ""hard Brexit"" may also have been a factor. Data shows the vast majority of younger people backed Remain while older people voted Leave. While precise figures for turnout among the 18 to 25-year-olds at the General Election are not yet available, Mr Thrasher said the exit poll revealed ""constituencies containing large numbers of graduates were flocking towards Labour"". ""Higher turnout hinted that younger people were voting in higher numbers than two years ago,"" he added.

But hardline Brexiteers in the Tory party have grown wary. Mr Hammond, a Remainer, could be pushing for a softer exit from the EU at the top of Government. His credibility was partly eroded after his first Budget ended in a shambles in March, forcing the Chancellor to climb down on a tax hike for self-employed workers. Tensions with the Prime Minister's team were heightened further when he hinted the Tories would ditch their triple tax lock in the 2017 manifesto, before it had been finalised by Number 10. The reported row fuelled speculation Mr Hammond was being lined up for the exit door if Mrs May won a sizeable majority, which the Chancellor had dismissed as media ""tittle-tattle"". Home Secretary - Amber Rudd Ms Rudd took on Mrs May's old job at the Home Office, since when she has led the department's response to three terror attacks. When Mrs May declined to take part in TV election debates, Ms Rudd stepped in as the Prime Minister's understudy, suggesting she has become one of Number 10's most trusted Cabinet ministers. She has been touted as a future Tory leader and potential rival to Mrs May, but the MP for Hastings and Rye only just scraped through the election with a majority of 346. Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson BoJo, as he is nicknamed by some, is often tipped as a likely successor to Mrs May and she will prefer to have him in the Cabinet rather than sniping from outside. The former London mayor has made no secret of his ambitions to hold the top job, but was badly burnt following last year's referendum vote when he was very publicly knifed in the back by fellow Brexiteer Michael Gove. With the PM weakened, there is already a suggestion the charismatic politician is ""on manoeuvres"", and he will at the very least be seeking to reassert his influence in Government after being sidelined in the election campaign. The master of bluff and bluster, who once famously became stuck on a zip wire, retained his seat in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, but ducked questions over his party's dire poll showing by making a swift exit after the count. Defence Secretary - Sir Michael Fallon The knight of the realm is the calm at the centre of the storm for the Prime Minister and she will value his apparently unflappable nature in the tough times ahead. Often wheeled out to defend controversial Tory policy, the Sevenoaks MP's deadpan delivery provides a foil to interviewers' probing questions. A former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, he has held a variety of jobs in government, including serving as business and then energy minister in the coalition administration. The defence brief, which he had held since 2014, was his first Cabinet role. Brexit Secretary - David Davis The one-time contender for the Conservative leadership is a leading Leave campaigner and was handed the job of overseeing Britain's departure from the EU by Mrs May, bringing him back to the Tory frontbench after a 19-year absence. A leaked report of a recent meeting between EU bosses and Mrs May at Downing Street revealed the visitors were left wondering if Mr Davis would survive beyond the election. It had been speculated Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer was being lined up as a new Brexit Secretary, but he lost his seat on Thursday night."

Impressive, but not a win. He told Sky News that Theresa May had lost the election and should resign. :: LIVE: Hung parliament - latest updates from General Election 2017 :: May: I'll lead the country at this critical time But currently, Mr Corbyn has no path to Number 10, with Mrs May set to stay on and cobble together a working majority with the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs. So what happens next? Mr Corbyn now has a huge challenge and an opportunity. :: May's Brexit mandate 'has been rejected' :: Election results: How did your constituency vote? Having dramatically outperformed expectations, he has strengthened his position in his party and there is little doubt he stays on as leader. Mrs May is discredited by the fact that a party which the Conservatives dismissed as an unelectable shambles gave the Tories a run for their money. He won't be walking into Number 10. Even with a rainbow alliance of 14 Lib Dems, 35 Scottish Nationalists, four Plaid Cymru and one Green MP, which he has ruled out, it doesn't add up to the magic number of 326. His challenge is to unite his party at a time when talented critics, who have so far shunned his frontbench, may be open to working with him. :: Did youth vote buoy Corbyn at the polls? :: Corbyn: We are ready to serve the country He and his allies may be reluctant to extend a hand, but with the Tory party set for a period of turmoil, unity would be Labour's strength. He can also put pressure on a weakened Theresa May, whose agenda from Brexit to public services will need to change. A source close to Mr Corbyn told me: ""She has no mandate for reducing pensioner incomes; for cutting the winter fuel allowance; for the dementia tax; for fox-hunting; for taking away free school lunches or a race-to-the-bottom Brexit."" There will be Tory MPs who agree with some of that, and the challenge for Mr Corbyn - always happier on the campaign trail than managing the House of Commons - is to use his new strength effectively to inflict defeats on the Government. Seven weeks ago, Labour went backwards at the local elections. :: How close was that! Seat won by TWO votes :: Britain's hung parliament 'yet another own goal' Last night, from South Stockton in Yorkshire, to Weaver Vale in Cheshire and Canterbury in Kent (Tory-held for more than 100 years), the party won seats with its radical programme. A strategy of holding rallies in a lot of safe - or apparently out-of-reach - seats had seemed ill-targeted at times. But it was closely influenced by the almost daily focus groups at Labour HQ which showed areas such as Warrington, Crewe, Colne Valley and Swindon (where Labour increased its majority but didn't win) were very much in play. Insiders believe the turning point was his manifesto. Billions of pounds for the struggling NHS, more money for schools, no more tuition fees and a promise that only those earning more than £80,000 would pay higher taxes. It was positive; it was hopeful, and most of all it appealed to young voters. And as Mr Corbyn sold it in TV interviews, he seemed increasingly confident and energised, as Mrs May - deploying attack lines - seemed nervy and uncomfortable. :: Hung parliament could jeopardise Brexit plan :: Hung parliament: What happens when no one wins?  He was also gifted a Tory manifesto which MPs admitted to me privately at the time was a disaster. Many thought the social care policy was botched, there were no sunlit uplands in sight and discussion of fox-hunting took voters' minds back to the pre-David Cameron ""detoxification"" era. Tories say their presidential-style campaign - focused on Mrs May - ignored the economy and therefore failed to rebut Labour's spending plans. Mr Corbyn has shown his party he can make gains on a more left-wing manifesto than they have had in 30 years. The Conservatives - even if their leader changes - will also need to take it on board."

It did not happen. There was no ceremonial walk down Downing Street. It is worth noting where we were just before the PM called the snap election. The Prime Minister had inherited David Cameron's 12-seat majority. She has now lost that. She had a manifesto that had been voted on by a majority, limiting the House of Lords capacity to interfere on manifesto promises. Now the House of Lords is free to use its legislative block on Tory manifesto promises that have not won majority support from the electorate, such as leaving the single market and the customs union. :: Theresa May's 'new' Cabinet: Who are they? :: May and inner circle face backlash from furious Tory MPs The PM needs to pass a Queen's Speech in the next few days - with the help of the Democratic Unionist Party. Doing a deal with the DUP has created acute concern among some Conservatives, in particular Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, over climate change denial and gay rights. The PM had promised to strengthen her hand in negotiation with the EU. Paris, Berlin and Brussels are now well aware that her hand is weaker not stronger. So what happens if the first thing that happens is that the EU levies a so-called exit bill of tens of billions of pounds? Does Mrs May have a mandate to threaten leaving with no deal? If time ran out would Parliament extend the deal? Does the House of Lords feel obliged to pass the Great Repeal Bill? The PM has immediate problems because of her lack of MPs. :: Election live: May under pressure as she clings to power :: General Election 2017: Results in full Many are also furious with a campaign lacking in vision and positivity, but also a strategic mistake. The May strategy was to alienate ""citizens of nowhere"" and win over Labour working class heartlands. It failed. On Thursday probably a majority of voters were Remain voters, and yet Mrs May targeted her Brexit efforts at a subset of Leave voters. They were meant to hoover up millions of UKIP 2015 voters. Instead, Labour benefited the most. Tory MPs report a wave of hostility from young voters and Tory voters too over Mrs May's Brexit plans. In London, some Tory councillors and Tory aides to ministers voted Lib Dem. Kensington and Battersea went to Labour. In Downing Street Mrs May said only the Conservatives ""have the legitimacy"" to form a government. And yet she said at almost every election campaign rally that if she lost just six seats she would have lost the election. She is still in Downing Street - mainly because the Tory backbenchers can think of no better option. :: Theresa May's SPADs in firing line after election woe :: Seven challenges facing PM in next 10 days There is a myriad of pitfalls that await her. Any number could catalyse her exit from Downing Street. One Conservative MP thinks she will last just six months. Another has called for her to fire her top aides. Minority governments can last: Scotland has seen examples of that. But normally it requires avoiding controversial legislation that will test the discipline of a party. The combination of no majority, a split party and having to pass dozens of pieces of controversial Brexit legislation seems completely unsustainable. It is a matter of when, not if, it falls apart."

Mr Nuttall, who came third in Boston and Skegness, said he had left the foundations for a new leader and insisted UKIP was ""still on the pitch"" and ""more relevant than ever"". He said ""a new era must begin with a new leader"", adding the party would be the ""guard dogs of Brexit"". :: LIVE: Hung parliament - May to visit Queen Mr Nuttall added: ""It is clear that UKIP requires a new focus, new ideas and a new energy - and it is there amongst out ranks. ""I predict after last night that if things go the way I expect, UKIP could in 18 months' time be bigger in terms of poll rating and members than it ever has been before."" Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage praised Mr Nuttall for an ""excellent speech"" and said he was ""very sorry"" about his departure. Earlier, Mr Farage said he did not blame Mr Nuttall for UKIP's poor performance and refused to be drawn on whether he would make a comeback as the party's leader. Although Boston and Skegness yielded one of the biggest Leave votes in last year's EU referendum, Mr Nuttall finished a distant third behind the Conservatives and Labour. Tory Matt Warman claimed the seat with 27,271 votes - a 19.8% vote share increase. :: Theresa May working to form a government with DUP backing It was Mr Nuttall's sixth unsuccessful attempt to get into Parliament, having finished second behind Labour at the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election earlier this year. Sky News correspondent Tom Rayner, who followed UKIP throughout its campaign, says there are four reasons why support for the party collapsed: :: Relevance UKIP has always claimed to be more than a single-issue party, but voters have made clear that is precisely what they are. In the wake of the Brexit referendum, it seems the vast majority of the nearly four million people who voted for UKIP in 2015 have decided it is now a party without purpose. Calls for burka bans, slashing the foreign aid budget and zero percent net immigration fell on deaf ears. Outgoing leader Paul Nuttall predicts the party is simply ahead of its time on these issues - but whether that's true will perhaps only be seen at then next election, and UKIP may well not be around to capitalise on it. :: Resources UKIP stood aside in a number of seats in order to allow hardline Brexiteers from both Labour and the Conservatives an easier run, but that doesn't entirely account for fielding 246 fewer candidates compared to 2015. The truth is the party has haemorrhaged money and membership in the last year. It went into this election, materially-speaking, a shell of what it was two years ago. Mr Nuttall tried to spin this as an opportunity to focus on a few key seats rather than spread resources across the country - but if that's what they did, it didn't work. In areas where the party had previously enjoyed support and put in some campaign effort - Thanet South, Boston and Skegness, Dagenham and Rainham, Clacton and Thurrock - they were left embarrassed. :: Labour When the election was called, the key dynamic everyone was talking about was how many of those 3.8 million UKIP voters from 2015 would switch to the Tories. Predictions were that anything from 50% to 70% could make the shift. What was not predicted is that Labour would hoover up a good proportion of those voters too. This has disproved the theory that UKIP was a ""gateway drug"" - the route by which former Labour diehards could bring themselves to do the unconscionable and vote Conservative. This is not only one of the key reasons Theresa May failed to win the majority she had hoped for, but very bad news for UKIP. They were confident they could win back eurosceptic Tory voters in a year or two if they didn't like how she handled Brexit. But if those voters are spread between a governing and an opposition party, it seems unlikely former Ukippers will return en masse. :: Leadership Paul Nuttall has quit the party leadership after less than a year in charge. He had talked down both his own chances of winning a seat and the likely fortunes of his own party throughout the campaign. But even he cannot have imagined how bad the results turned out to be. Many will ask whether it could have been any different had Nigel Farage still been leader. Mr Nuttall has been fairly strong at communicating from behind podiums, but lacks the electricity of his predecessor out on the doorstep. Charisma alone would not have saved UKIP's national vote share, but there's just a chance Mr Farage might have had a shot in Clacton or Thanet South if he'd have given it a high-profile push. Although he has backed Mr Nuttall throughout, Mr Farage has kept his distance from the campaign. Now the party embarks on yet another leadership election - the third in a year - with no obvious heir, no obvious voter base and with the party's ultimate existence in question."
2017-06-09,It took the blink of an eye for the City to react to the first exit poll.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170610032840/http://news.sky.com/story/the-citys-reaction-to-election-result-explained-10909535,"On Thursday night, at 10pm, a hung parliament was predicted and the value of the pound fell by nearly 2%. Many expected it to fall a lot further, because of fears of chaos. :: LIVE: Hung parliament latest  There is no City mantra better known than the one about markets hating uncertainty, and some analysts had predicted a much bigger slide in the value of sterling. But in fact, it stopped there for hours, even as that exit poll was borne out over the course of the evening. The pound took a tumble - a nasty tumble - but it didn't fall down the side of a mountain. And then on Friday morning, the FTSE 100, our main index of shares, opened up, breaching the 7500 point mark and adding very nearly 1% in early trading. You might just have asked yourself if the City was actually pretty pleased with what it was seeing. The answer, as ever, is a bit of a mixture. Certainly most investors in the financial sector had, like the bookmakers and most observers, been expecting the Conservatives to win a comfortable overall majority. When that didn't happen, ushering in the uncertainty of a hung parliament, the pound was sold off. But something else happened - the immediate calculation that a so-called hard Brexit was now less likely. That option - of walking away from negotiations, leaving a single market and reverting to the rules of the World Trade Organisation - has struggled to find many supporters in the City. :: Hung parliament could jeopardise Brexit plan The idea that a hard Brexit was now being pushed back seemed to inspire some to buy the pound, stemming its losses. It still fell, but not spectacularly. So why did the FTSE 100 go up? Simply because it is an index of big companies, not a barometer of the British economy. Over the past couple of decades, a growing proportion of those companies have earned the big bulk of their money in foreign currencies - but still report profits in pounds. :: How close was that! Seat won by TWO votes So if the pound weakens by 1.5%, then immediately those overseas earning are worth 1.5% more. These days, when the pound weakens, the FTSE 100 rises mechanically. The next 250 biggest companies in Britain have their own index, known, somewhat predictably, as the FTSE 250. That index is much more focused on British business, and far less prone to the effects of currency fluctuations. On Friday, it fell by 1% on opening, but then it, too, recovered. :: A momentous election night in pictures Many are simply waiting to see what happens on two fronts - the profound question of who leads the nation and guides the economy. But also the granular details of how the UK will approach Brexit, and whether a government will stick to the March 2019 deadline, or now try to negotiate a transitional period. For British business, for the City, the investors and the nation's biggest industries - these are the questions that all need answering. Until those answers come, you're going to hear a lot about that old City favourite - uncertainty - with investors, perhaps, earning the right to be heartily sick of electoral shocks. In a sign of frustration, one senior investment banker said to me of Theresa May's election: ""This is a total, unnecessary mess... we've got no faith in her as a Prime Minister."""

But as she stood waiting for the declaration in her Maidenhead constituency just before 3.30am, the Prime Minister had a face like thunder. When she spoke, her voice was cracking. She sounded - as well as looked - badly shaken. She must know her days as Prime Minister are numbered. By calling for a ""period of stability"" in her acceptance speech, she sounded as if she was pleading with Conservative MPs not to move to oust her just yet. :: Hung parliament: What happens when no one wins? Oh dear! Her gamble of a snap election to win a Brexit mandate had horribly backfired. Despite her plea, members of her Cabinet were already plotting. Close allies like Ben Gummer had lost their seats and the woman some saw as a potential Chancellor and future Tory leader, Amber Rudd, was taken to two recounts. Many Tories would claim it was no more than the pipsqueak Gummer deserved. After all, they would argue, he was the clown who wrote the vote-losing manifesto. :: Hung parliament could jeopardise Brexit timetable A week ago, some were tipping him for promotion to the Cabinet and possibly even taking over as Brexit Secretary from David Davis. Rough old game, politics. But it wasn't just the Conservatives who suffered big-name casualties. Back in 1997, the cry went up: ""Were you still up for Portillo?"" At the last election, in 2015, the question was whether you were you still up for Ed Balls and Vince Cable. This time, perhaps the most stunning casualty was Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister. Not surprisingly, his face was a picture of gloom and dejection as it became clear that he was crashing to defeat. It must have hurt even more because just as he was losing in Sheffield Hallam, Vince Cable was winning back his old Twickenham seat. Later, another Lib Dem member of the 2010-15 Coalition cabinet, Ed Davey, won his old seat back, too. Then, within an hour of predicting that Theresa May would be gone within 48 hours, Alex Salmond lost his seat in Aberdeenshire, following the defeat of the SNP's Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, earlier. Contrast the mood in Maidenhead with that in Islington. We should have known something was up when we saw two police officers standing guard outside Mr Corbyn's home just before 10pm. Did somebody tip off the Metropolitan Police that the Labour leader's status was about to be enhanced by the shock exit poll predicting a hung Parliament? Earlier this week, Mr Corbyn sounded rather foolish when two days before polling day he called on the Prime Minister to resign over cuts in police manpower. He sounded much more convincing when, in his victory speech in Islington, he called on her to quit after the election results showed Labour holding on to seats the party previously thought were vulnerable to the Tories. Back in Maidenhead, Mrs May faced - and ignored - questions over whether she was going to resign as she arrived in the hall for the result of her count. Who would have thought as recently as two days ago that it would be Theresa May facing questions about her future on election night and not Jeremy Corbyn? Despite Mr Corbyn's better than expected performance, however, there will be plenty of Labour MPs who will claim that with a better leader the party could have won a handsome election victory. But that's churlish. Mr Corbyn, too, was looking his smartest on election night: a neat, dark suit and a red tie as bright as Theresa May's lipstick. He's never going to be a fashion icon. But he does seem to have heeded the advice David Cameron passed on from his mother at PMQs last year: ""Put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem."" He's done the first two. He just needs to learn to do the third! And as for Theresa May, after results like these, she's left with a face as red as her crimson lipstick and Mr Corbyn's tie."

The Prime Minister called the General Election to try and boost her mandate ahead of Brexit negotiations. But the gamble failed as she did not get an absolute majority. And with the EU divorce looming she will have to convince both Remainers and Brexiteers that she can secure a good deal for the country. However, a sticking point is set to be continuing to be a member of the single market which Mrs May and the Tories had ruled out in their manifesto. Brussels has insisted that freedom of movement is a requirement of access to the single market, and this will almost certainly be opposed by the Conservatives because of their commitment to take back control of the UK borders and curb immigration. 2. Negotiating with the Democratic Unionist Party She has called upon the support of the DUP in Northern Ireland to shore up her minority government. They have 10 seats which will be crucial in pushing ahead with the PM's plans in the House of Commons. The DUP is likely to drive a hard bargain for its support. On top of seeking to broker a beneficial deal for Northern Ireland, the party has warned against a hard Brexit, despite campaigning to leave the EU And it will oppose any move with the Republic to impose checks at the border. In addition, it looks likely to be a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement - which does not provide the greater security and certainty that would be offered in a formal coalition. The DUP could agree to back the Government on the budget and any vote of confidence while deciding other measures on a vote-by-vote basis. 3. Form her new Cabinet, including senior and junior ministers Theresa May will have several posts to fill after she lost eight frontbenchers. Ministers Jane Ellison, Simon Kirby, Gavin Barwell, James Wharton, Nicola Blackwood, Rob Wilson and Edward Timpson all lost their seats. Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer, the author of the widely criticised Tory manifesto, was also ousted. Will the top people keep their jobs? For example Chancellor Philip Hammond, who was rumoured to have fallen out with Mrs May, and who had a fairly low profile during the campaign. 4. Tory dissent over her leadership The Tory campaign sought to make Mrs May an asset and she ended up being a liability. Some Tory MPs did not like making her the sole focus of the campaign and were also deeply critical of the manifesto which led to a political own goal over changes in social care plans. Her remote style and unwillingness to engage with the public, in stark contrast to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also drawn criticism. Both inside and outside the party, Mrs May has ruffled feathers, not least arch-critic, former chancellor and now Evening Standard editor George Osborne, and there will be no shortage of people wanting her job. And in the Commons, she will require total loyalty from her backbenchers, given her precarious political position. 5. Could she appoint new advisers and shake-up her internal team? Mrs May's two key advisers are Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, but there will now be serious questions asked over their future given their close ties to the failed campaign and their bunker approach. The PM's gamble of calling a snap election to increase her majority had backfired in spectacular fashion, so could the pair be casualties or will she stick by them? Co-chief of staff Mr Timothy was widely blamed for the disastrous proposal to reform social care funding in the party's manifesto without consultation. Tory MP Nigel Evans blamed the social care policy debacle for the loss of the majority, saying ""we hijacked our own campaign"" and called for change in Mrs May's leadership team. Fellow Tory MP Sarah Wollaston also called for the PM's inner circle to go, as she tweeted: ""Hope we never again have such a negative campaign. ""I cannot see how the inner circle of special advisers can continue in post. Needs to be far more inclusive in future."" 6. Preparing for the Queen's Speech on 19 June Having lost her majority, the PM is now faced with having to push through parliament a legislation programme that her critics will insist she has no mandate to deliver. And she is likely to face stiff opposition both in the Commons and in the House of Lords where the government already does not have a majority. 7. Demands for another election Despite insisting ""now let's get to work"", her opponents are unlikely to be silenced in their calls for her to go and given her lack of mandate, ultimately demand another election."

Sky's Northern Ireland Correspondent, David Blevins, said: ""The DUP have a very delicate balance to strike between how they use this power they suddenly find themselves with, and how they ensure that anything they demand does not derail efforts to restore devolution here.

2017-06-09,The exit poll predicts that the Conservatives will be the largest party but will not have a majority which means there will be a hung parliament.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170610032840/http://news.sky.com/story/hung-parliament-how-a-government-would-be-formed-if-there-is-no-majority-10909125,"So what does that mean for the next five years? What is a hung parliament? A hung parliament happens when no party has the 326 seats needed for the majority that allows them to govern outright. A coalition generally needs more than 326 MPs in order to govern successfully, but, as Sinn Fein opts not to take their seats in the UK parliament, the number required can sometimes be smaller. What happens immediately after all the results are in? Protocol means that the previous government generally remains in place while there is a period of negotiation while discussions take place to form a coalition. Following the General Election in 2010, when no party had a majority, Gordon Brown remained as prime minister while the talks were taking place. :: General Election results in full :: LIVE: Sky's Election blog It can take several weeks before parties strike an agreement to form a coalition. If the incumbent government is unable to form a coalition big enough to rule, they may either resign and the largest opposition party may be invited to form a government, or they may try to continue to govern as a minority government. In 2010, once talks between David Cameron's Conservatives and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats had been going for some time, Gordon Brown realised he would be unable to form a majority government and resigned, paving the way for David Cameron to become prime minister. Does the Prime Minister have to resign? The Prime Minister only has to resign if it is clear they cannot command a majority of the House of Commons on votes of confidence or supply. :: Election results in full: Live vote share and seat changes A confidence and supply agreement happens when a party or member of parliament agree to support the government on motions of confidence. If a party can garner enough support to prevent them losing a motion of confidence, they can usually govern as a minority government but they may have some difficulty getting legislation through parliament unless they can win support of MPs outside their own party. What happens if there is no overall control? There were a number of occasions in the 20th Century when there has been no overall control. In 1923, the Conservative Party lost their majority and were unable to form a coalition. The party, led by Stanley Baldwin, stumbled on for nine months before they lost a vote on the King's speech in January 1924. The Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald then took office and governed as a minority administration until October of that year when that government too was defeated. It resulted in another election that was won by the Conservatives, with a much increased majority. In February 1974, the incumbent Conservative administration lost its majority. Edward Heath, who was four seats behind Harold Wilson's Labour Party, remained prime minister for a few days while he tried to form a coalition. He failed, leaving Mr Wilson to form a government but without a majority. He, like the government in 1923, carried on for a short time (seven months), before another election took place, which resulted in a Labour majority of three. With such a small majority, Labour was able to govern but by 1977 it had to draw on the support of the Liberals and a pact was formed that lasted until May 1978. What will happen this time if there is a hung parliament? A coalition looks unlikely at this stage as the Liberal Democrats have ruled out working with either party. The Conservatives will look to work with the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland but that still may not give them a working majority. Even if Labour forms a pact with the Scottish National Party, they may also not have enough to form even a minority government. If no party is able to command a majority on the basis of confidence and supply, the parties may have no choice but to call for another General Election."

Alex Salmond, who led the SNP into the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, lost his Gordon seat to the Conservatives. Ben Gummer, who helped write the Tory manifesto, lost his seat in Ipswich. Housing minister Gavin Barwell lost in Croydon Central and Jane Ellison's 8,000 majority in Battersea was overturned with a 10% swing to Labour.

Impressive, but not a win. He told Sky News that Theresa May had lost the election and should resign. :: LIVE: Hung parliament - latest updates from General Election 2017 :: May: I'll lead the country at this critical time But currently, Mr Corbyn has no path to Number 10, with Mrs May set to stay on and cobble together a working majority with the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs. So what happens next? Mr Corbyn now has a huge challenge and an opportunity. :: May's Brexit mandate 'has been rejected' :: Election results: How did your constituency vote? Having dramatically outperformed expectations, he has strengthened his position in his party and there is little doubt he stays on as leader. Mrs May is discredited by the fact that a party which the Conservatives dismissed as an unelectable shambles gave the Tories a run for their money. He won't be walking into Number 10. Even with a rainbow alliance of 14 Lib Dems, 35 Scottish Nationalists, four Plaid Cymru and one Green MP, which he has ruled out, it doesn't add up to the magic number of 326. His challenge is to unite his party at a time when talented critics, who have so far shunned his frontbench, may be open to working with him. :: Did youth vote buoy Corbyn at the polls? :: Corbyn: We are ready to serve the country He and his allies may be reluctant to extend a hand, but with the Tory party set for a period of turmoil, unity would be Labour's strength. He can also put pressure on a weakened Theresa May, whose agenda from Brexit to public services will need to change. A source close to Mr Corbyn told me: ""She has no mandate for reducing pensioner incomes; for cutting the winter fuel allowance; for the dementia tax; for fox-hunting; for taking away free school lunches or a race-to-the-bottom Brexit."" There will be Tory MPs who agree with some of that, and the challenge for Mr Corbyn - always happier on the campaign trail than managing the House of Commons - is to use his new strength effectively to inflict defeats on the Government. Seven weeks ago, Labour went backwards at the local elections. :: How close was that! Seat won by TWO votes :: Britain's hung parliament 'yet another own goal' Last night, from South Stockton in Yorkshire, to Weaver Vale in Cheshire and Canterbury in Kent (Tory-held for more than 100 years), the party won seats with its radical programme. A strategy of holding rallies in a lot of safe - or apparently out-of-reach - seats had seemed ill-targeted at times. But it was closely influenced by the almost daily focus groups at Labour HQ which showed areas such as Warrington, Crewe, Colne Valley and Swindon (where Labour increased its majority but didn't win) were very much in play. Insiders believe the turning point was his manifesto. Billions of pounds for the struggling NHS, more money for schools, no more tuition fees and a promise that only those earning more than £80,000 would pay higher taxes. It was positive; it was hopeful, and most of all it appealed to young voters. And as Mr Corbyn sold it in TV interviews, he seemed increasingly confident and energised, as Mrs May - deploying attack lines - seemed nervy and uncomfortable. :: Hung parliament could jeopardise Brexit plan :: Hung parliament: What happens when no one wins?  He was also gifted a Tory manifesto which MPs admitted to me privately at the time was a disaster. Many thought the social care policy was botched, there were no sunlit uplands in sight and discussion of fox-hunting took voters' minds back to the pre-David Cameron ""detoxification"" era. Tories say their presidential-style campaign - focused on Mrs May - ignored the economy and therefore failed to rebut Labour's spending plans. Mr Corbyn has shown his party he can make gains on a more left-wing manifesto than they have had in 30 years. The Conservatives - even if their leader changes - will also need to take it on board."

Even normally loyal MPs say the social care muddle was a big vote loser and are holding her joint chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, responsible. :: Theresa May's SPADs in firing line after election woe Some top Tories are also unhappy that Mrs May has turned to the Democratic Unionist Party - which opposes gay marriage - to prop up the Tories in the Commons. :: Who are the DUP power brokers? The heroine of the Conservative campaign, Scottish leader Ruth Davidson, signalled her opposition by tweeting a link to a same-sex marriage lecture she gave last year. As a Protestant Unionist about to marry an Irish Catholic, here's the Amnesty Pride lecture I gave in Belfast...https://t.co/NdRaT2s3W5 Ms Davidson telephoned the Prime Minister and demanded assurances that she was not planning to ditch Tory commitments to gay rights in return for DUP votes in the Commons. According to many MPs, re-appointing the Chancellor Philip Hammond, who was tipped for the sack if the Tories won a big majority, is seen as sign of the Prime Minister's weakness. :: Theresa May's 'new' Cabinet: Who are they? Also re-appointed, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is said to be ""on manoeuvres"" and sounding out MPs about a leadership bid. Loyalists but potential rivals Amber Rudd, David Davis and Sir Michael Fallon also stay put, meaning it's as you were for the top five Cabinet ministers. As she retreated inside No. 10, it was claimed the Prime Minister had to be told to apologise to her defeated MPs and ministers, by the chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady. In a TV interview, she said: ""As I reflect on the result, I will reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward. ""I am sorry for those candidates and hard-working party workers who weren't successful but also particularly sorry for those colleagues who were MPs or ministers who had contributed so much to our country and who lost their seats and didn't deserve to lose their seats."" :: Theresa May: I wanted different result, but now I'll lead One Conservative MP, Heidi Allen, predicted she would be gone in six months. Other Conservative MPs are said to be taking soundings about removing Mrs May in the autumn. Others such as Sarah Wollaston, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan have also called for Mrs May to step aside - with the latter suggesting she should go within ""weeks or months'"" because her ""credibility is shot"". :: Seven challenges facing PM in next 10 daysAfter the backlash from her MPs the Prime Minister left Downing Street by the back door. But she can't hide from those Tory MPs who are now turning on her. And nearly 24 hours after polls closed across the country, Labour finally took the central London seat of Kensington after three recounts, meaning the final tally remained at 318 seats for the Conservatives and 262 for Labour. The painstaking counting process ended up revealing Emma Dent Coad won by just 20 votes, claiming 16,333 against Tory's Victoria Borwick's 16,313."
2017-06-10,"Jeremy Corbyn says he is ""ready to serve the country"" but refused to be drawn on whether he would try to form a minority government.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170611042303/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-we-are-ready-to-serve-the-country-10909295,"Following a disastrous night for the Conservatives, Mr Corbyn reiterated his call for the Prime Minister to resign as he claimed it was ""pretty clear who won this election"". Mr Corbyn said his party had made no deals or pacts, but added: ""We are ready to do everything we can to put our programme into operation."" He said: ""Parliament must meet and Parliament will have to take a decision on what happens, when a government puts forward the Queen's Speech, we will put forward our point of view, we are of course ready to serve."" :: LIVE: Hung parliament but May will not quit Asked about Brexit talks due to begin on 19 June, Mr Corbyn said they ""will have to go ahead"" and called for a ""jobs-first"" agreement with the EU. The Tories remain the biggest party with 318 seats and Labour currently have 261 - with 326 required for a majority and one seat left to be called. Though Labour fell well short of a majority, the party pulled off a shock and defied pollsters by increasing its vote share by 9.5% and making gains across the country. In one of the biggest surprises of the night, former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg lost his Sheffield Hallam seat to Labour's 25-year-old candidate Jared O'Mara. :: Hung parliament: What happens when no one wins? Elsewhere, rising Conservative star Ben Gummer - one of the architects of Theresa May's manifesto - lost to Labour in Ipswich by 831 votes. In Canterbury, Labour edged out the Tories by 187 votes to win the constituency for the first time since it was formed in 1918. Kensington, a seat which the Conservatives have held since 1974, is also in play for Mr Corbyn's party as it has gone to a third recount. In Scotland, Labour bounced back from its near collapse in 2015 - gaining East Lothian, Midlothian, Rutherglen & Hamilton West, Coatbridge, Chryston & Bellshill, Glasgow North East and Kirkcaldy & Cowdenbeath. Earlier, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour was ""ready to form a government"" and described any possible Conservative-Democratic Unionist Party arrangement as a ""coalition of chaos"". :: Theresa May 'working to form a government' He told Sky News: ""We've always said, whatever the circumstances, we're ready to serve the country and we're ready to form a government. ""In our position that'd be a minority government and the way that would operate is we'd put forward our own Queen's Speech and our own Budget as well, and then would expect other parties to vote for it."" :: A momentous election night in pictures Former home secretary Lord Blunkett told Sky News he had ""never been a Corbynista"" but gave ""all credit"" to the Labour leader for the party's surge in the polls. He said: ""The anti-austerity programme that he led has been extremely successful, backed up by those who didn't always agree with him so there's been unity across the country in the last seven weeks with the Labour party. ""We are very pleased not only that we have got colleagues back but we have new colleagues."" More follows..."

But that means it is worse than the national average, and the North-South divide is acutely felt. ""The town's in bits,"" Ms McGinnis told Sky News. ""Labour might get stuff done.""

A 24-year-old man, who police believe was a passenger in the VW, was shot in the head. The driver of the car, who suffered minor injuries, drove the victim to hospital where he later died. There are road closures in place and police have advised the public to avoid the area as they carry out a full examination of the crime scene. Detectives from the Homicide and Major Crime Command are investigating the shooting, and are appealing for witnesses to contact them. Despite the Metropolitan Police's commitment to cracking down on weapon crime in London, gun crime is on the rise. According to official statistics, which are recorded by the financial year, there were 2,544 firearms offences in 2016/17 in London - a 41% rise compared with 1,793 in 2015/16."

Airport authorities said 151 passengers left flight EZY3246 on the emergency slides after ""the pilot had been informed about a suspicious conversation on board"". They were taken to a gate to be checked by police and the airport said experts had ""blown up"" an item of luggage. A passenger on the flight told Sky News they were told the aircraft was diverting for ""operational reasons"". He said police gathered outside the plane, which was escorted to a quiet area of the airport. ""We were told they would board to deal with a security situation,"" said the passenger. ""When they boarded, they went to the back and took off two men plus two other passengers, who were the ones that reported the two men to cabin crew. ""The two men were questioned outside separately, then handcuffed and taken away and police wanted us off the plane quickly, so we had to use emergency slides."" He said all passengers were briefly questioned by police and told they would be put up in a hotel for the night. Take-offs and landings were suspended for three hours during the security alert, causing 10 flights to be diverted and delays to 20 outbound flights. Easyjet said the captain had landed ""as a precaution to enable the aircraft to go through additional security checks in Cologne where the aircraft was met by the police"". It added: ""We plan to operate the flight tomorrow morning and so are providing all passengers with hotel accommodation and refreshments along with regular updates. ""We thank passengers for their understanding. The safety of easyJet's passengers and crew is our highest priority."""

During the hearing at Manchester Civil Justice, a map was shown which pinpointed where each victim was at the time of the 22 May blast. The nearest was just five yards from Abedi, 22, while the furthest was 20 metres away. Nineteen died at the scene while three were rushed to hospital and pronounced dead shortly afterwards, the inquests were told. Detective superintendent Jonathan Chadwick said Abedi's device was ""designed to kill and maim indiscriminately the largest number of innocent people"". At the time of the explosion, the foyer near Victoria Station was full of people making their way out following a concert by Ariana Grande, he added. Of the 220 people who received medical treatment, a number sustained life-changing injuries and some remain critically ill. Providing an update on Greater Manchester Police's investigation, Detective Superintendent Chadwick said 32 addresses had been searched and 10 were still under police control. Three people remain in custody and police are examining ""significant evidence"" found in a car linked to Abedi. Concluding the inquests, coroner Nigel Meadows paid tribute to the ""truly unbelievable dignity and strength of spirit that all the bereaved families have demonstrated in the face of such overwhelming grief"". Mr Meadows said there were ""too many to list"" who worked ""behind the scenes"" to assist and treat those injured in the attack. He also praised the ""tremendous"" work done by Greater Manchester Police crime scene management officers, police family liaison officers, mortuary staff and forensic pathologists. Mr Meadows said: ""The response to this tragic incident has been a complete and total team effort from all."" Prior to the hearing, which none of the families of the deceased attended, a minute's silence was held for those affected by the bombing and also the London Bridge atrocity. An inquest into Abedi's death will be opened at a later date."

The 47-year-old suffered a fractured knee while racing an electric super car, but was not seriously injured. Hammond's friend and fellow presenter Jeremy Clarkson described it as the ""biggest"" and ""most frightening"" crash he had ever seen, adding in a Twitter post: ""Thankfully, Richard seems to be mostly OK."" A spokesperson for The Grand Tour said: ""Richard was conscious and talking, and climbed out of the car himself before the vehicle burst into flames. ""He was flown by air ambulance to hospital in St Gallen to be checked over - revealing a fracture to his knee. ""Nobody else was in the car or involved in the accident, and we'd like to thank the paramedics on site for their swift response. ""The cause of the crash is unknown and is being investigated."" It was the biggest crash I've ever seen and the most frightening but incredibly, and thankfully, Richard seems to be mostly OK. Hammond was racing a Rimac Concept One car, built in Croatia, during the Hemburg Hill Climb. It was filmed as part of the second series of The Grand Tour, the Amazon Prime programme that Hammond, Clarkson and James May joined after leaving the BBC's Top Gear in 2015. According to the car manufacturer's website, the Concept One can reach a maximum speed of 220mph thanks to its 1,224 horsepower. The Hemburg Hill Climb takes place over a one mile-long course, which climbs 157m (515ft). Contestants average speeds of more than 70mph. In 2006, Hammond suffered brain injuries after crashing a jet-propelled car while travelling at close to 300mph. The horror accident left him in intensive care, where he was in a coma for two weeks. Hammond had been behind the wheel of a Vampire dragster that had previously broken the British land speed record. Last month, Hammond revealed he is now more cautious about what car stunts he is willing to film. He told the Daily Mirror: ""I've a beautiful wife and two beautiful daughters. I'm not going to risk leaving them. ""Not for their sake, but for mine."""

Critics of the Prime Minister say the result is a rejection of her pursuit of a so-called ""hard Brexit"", shorthand for the UK leaving the single market, exiting the customs union and ending freedom of movement from Europe. :: May's top aides resign after election When asked if her 13 MPs in Scotland should back remaining in the single market regardless of how their colleagues south of the border vote, Ms Davidson said: ""There are an awful lot of issues surrounding Brexit that need to be discussed. ""Clearly there's no majority government that's come through after this election, and that means that we do have to listen to other parties."" Ms Davidson said the party's representatives in Scotland will vote ""entirely as they believe they should"", a hint that they could prove problematic for Mrs May on certain issues as she attempts to keep her minority government together. :: Who could replace May? The PM's likely successors In separate remarks, Ms Davidson vowed to put Scotland's case ""forcefully"" to the PM and dismissed reports she will break the Scottish Conservatives away from the UK party in the aftermath of the election. The PM's decision to seek support from the Democratic Unionist Party has caused unease, given the DUP's opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion. Ms Davidson said she had received assurances from Mrs May that there would be no ""rowing back"" on LGBTI rights in return for DUP votes in the Commons. :: 'Matter of time' before May government crumbles Meanwhile, several hundred protesters have gathered in central London to voice their anger at Mrs May's prospective agreement with the DUP. People carrying placards bearing anti-DUP and pro-Jeremy Corbyn messages congregated in Parliament Square. Organisers from Stand Up To Racism and the Stop The War Coalition spoke to the crowd, and there were cheers when the Labour leader's name was mentioned. Musicians performed to the protesters, who seemed in good spirits. One organiser led chants of ""racist, sexist, anti-gay, the DUP has got to go"".

2017-06-10,"The Conservatives will be the largest party but have not won the seats needed for an overall majority, which means we now have a hung parliament.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170611042303/http://news.sky.com/story/hung-parliament-how-a-government-would-be-formed-if-there-is-no-majority-10909125,"So what does that mean for the next five years? What is a hung parliament? A hung parliament happens when no party has the 326 seats needed for the majority that allows them to govern outright. A coalition generally needs more than 326 MPs in order to govern successfully, but, as Sinn Fein opts not to take their seats in the UK parliament, the number required can sometimes be smaller. What happens immediately after all the results are in? Protocol means that the previous government generally remains in place while there is a period of negotiation as discussions take place to form a coalition. Following the general election in 2010, when no party had a majority, Gordon Brown remained as prime minister while the talks were taking place. :: General Election results in full :: LIVE: Sky's Election blog It can take several weeks before parties strike an agreement to form a coalition. If the incumbent government is unable to form a coalition big enough to rule, they may either resign and the largest opposition party may be invited to form a government, or they may try to continue to govern as a minority government. In 2010, once talks between David Cameron's Conservatives and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats had been going for some time, Gordon Brown realised he would be unable to form a majority government and resigned, paving the way for David Cameron to become prime minister. Does the Prime Minister have to resign? The Prime Minister only has to resign if it is clear they cannot command a majority of the House of Commons on votes of confidence and supply. :: Election results in full: Live vote share and seat changes What is confidence and supply? Less formal than a full-blown coalition, a confidence and supply agreement happens when a party or member of parliament agree to support the government on motions of confidence. If a party can garner enough support to prevent them losing a motion of confidence, they can usually govern as a minority government but they may have some difficulty getting legislation through parliament unless they can win support of MPs outside their own party. If the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agree to such a deal with the Tories they would support (or possibly abstain on) a Queen's Speech put forward by a minority Conservative government. They would do the same with a Tory budget and a vote of no confidence, if one is tabled. But the DUP would judge other proposals on merit and would reserve the right to vote against the Tories on them. Why ""supply""? ""Supply"" refers to bills required for a minority government to receive money to allow it to enact its policies. It does not mean supplying policy concessions to smaller parties, although that is also involved. Why ""confidence""? This refers to the agreement of backing on votes of no confidence. It is not allusion to the trust, or otherwise, that signatories to the deal have in each other. What happens if there is no overall control? There were a number of occasions in the 20th century when there has been no overall control. In 1923, the Conservative Party lost their majority and were unable to form a coalition. The party, led by Stanley Baldwin, stumbled on for nine months before they lost a vote on the King's speech in January 1924. The Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald then took office and governed as a minority administration until October of that year when that government too was defeated. It resulted in another election that was won by the Conservatives, with a much increased majority. In February 1974, the incumbent Conservative administration lost its majority. Edward Heath, who was four seats behind Harold Wilson's Labour Party, remained prime minister for a few days while he tried to form a coalition. He failed, leaving Mr Wilson to form a government but without a majority. He, like the government in 1923, carried on for a short time (seven months), before another election took place, which resulted in a Labour majority of three. With such a small majority, Labour was able to govern but by 1977 it had to draw on the support of the Liberals and a pact was formed that lasted until May 1978. What will happen this time? A coalition looks unlikely at this stage as the Liberal Democrats have ruled out working with either party. The Conservatives will look to work with the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland but that still may not give them a working majority. Even if Labour forms a pact with the Scottish National Party, they may also not have enough to form even a minority government. If no party is able to command a majority on the basis of confidence and supply, the parties may have no choice but to call for another general election."
2017-06-10,"In office but not in much power. The rapid reappointment of five top Cabinet ministers, including Chancellor Phillip Hammond, shows Theresa May's hand is neither strong nor stable.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170611042303/http://news.sky.com/story/matter-of-time-before-theresa-mays-minority-government-crumbles-10910572,"An extensive reshuffle had been planned. It did not happen. There was no ceremonial walk down Downing Street. It is worth noting where we were just before the PM called the snap election. The Prime Minister had inherited David Cameron's 12-seat majority. She has now lost that. She had a manifesto that had been voted on by a majority, limiting the House of Lords capacity to interfere on manifesto promises. Now the House of Lords is free to use its legislative block on Tory manifesto promises that have not won majority support from the electorate, such as leaving the single market and the customs union. :: Theresa May's 'new' Cabinet: Who are they? :: May and inner circle face backlash from furious Tory MPs The PM needs to pass a Queen's Speech in the next few days - with the help of the Democratic Unionist Party. Doing a deal with the DUP has created acute concern among some Conservatives, in particular Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, over climate change denial and gay rights. The PM had promised to strengthen her hand in negotiation with the EU. Paris, Berlin and Brussels are now well aware that her hand is weaker not stronger. So what happens if the first thing that happens is that the EU levies a so-called exit bill of tens of billions of pounds? Does Mrs May have a mandate to threaten leaving with no deal? If time ran out would Parliament extend the deal? Does the House of Lords feel obliged to pass the Great Repeal Bill? The PM has immediate problems because of her lack of MPs. :: Election live: May under pressure as she clings to power :: General Election 2017: Results in full Many are also furious with a campaign lacking in vision and positivity, but also a strategic mistake. The May strategy was to alienate ""citizens of nowhere"" and win over Labour working class heartlands. It failed. On Thursday probably a majority of voters were Remain voters, and yet Mrs May targeted her Brexit efforts at a subset of Leave voters. They were meant to hoover up millions of UKIP 2015 voters. Instead, Labour benefited the most. Tory MPs report a wave of hostility from young voters and Tory voters too over Mrs May's Brexit plans. In London, some Tory councillors and Tory aides to ministers voted Lib Dem. Kensington and Battersea went to Labour. In Downing Street Mrs May said only the Conservatives ""have the legitimacy"" to form a government. And yet she said at almost every election campaign rally that if she lost just six seats she would have lost the election. She is still in Downing Street - mainly because the Tory backbenchers can think of no better option. :: Theresa May's SPADs in firing line after election woe :: Seven challenges facing PM in next 10 days There is a myriad of pitfalls that await her. Any number could catalyse her exit from Downing Street. One Conservative MP thinks she will last just six months. Another has called for her to fire her top aides. Minority governments can last: Scotland has seen examples of that. But normally it requires avoiding controversial legislation that will test the discipline of a party. The combination of no majority, a split party and having to pass dozens of pieces of controversial Brexit legislation seems completely unsustainable. It is a matter of when, not if, it falls apart."
2017-06-10,Theresa May's bid to do a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party to save her Premiership has been plunged into uncertainty.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170611042303/http://news.sky.com/story/dup-and-conservatives-deal-or-no-deal-on-minority-government-alliance-10911773,"In a move that could jeopardise her frantic attempts to remain as Prime Minister, the DUP is accusing Downing Street of announcing a deal on its MPs voting with the Tories in the Commons before an agreement has been reached. After the PM sent her Chief Whip Gavin Williamson to Belfast to negotiate a deal to keep the Conservatives in power, No. 10 said the DUP had agreed to the principles of an outline agreement. But in a dramatic twist just before midnight on Sunday, Sky sources said No. 10's account of the talks had been issued in error and the DUP had not yet reached any agreement with the Tories. :: Downing Street made statement on DUP 'in error' ""The DUP today (Saturday) held discussions with representatives of the Conservative Party in line with Arlene Foster's commitment to explore how we might bring stability to the nation at this time of great challenge,"" the party said in its own statement. ""The talks so far have been positive."" But the DUP added: ""Discussions will continue next week to work on the details and to reach agreement on arrangements for the new Parliament."" Then, after midnight, Downing Street responded, saying: ""The Prime Minister has tonight spoken with the DUP to discuss finalising a confidence and supply deal when Parliament returns next week. ""We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond. ""As and when details are finalised both parties will put them forward."" :: Davidson: Tories need to 'listen' on Brexit Some Tories, including the party's Scottish leader Ruth Davidson, are unhappy about a deal with the DUP because of the party's opposition to gay marriage and abortion and other policy clashes with the Conservatives. In another move in her bid to cling to power, the Prime Minister has parted company with her two closest No. 10 aides, joint chiefs of staff Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. :: May's top aides Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill resign They have been replaced by Gavin Barwell, a former government minister who lost his seat in the election. And in a phone call with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the PM attempted to show it's business as usual by confirming she'll start Brexit talks as planned in the ""next couple of weeks"". But, unlike during the election campaign, when she repeatedly referred to the talks starting on 19 June, she wasn't specific about the date, suggesting it might slip. :: Who could replace Theresa May? The PM's likely successors Amid a febrile atmosphere among Tory MPs, the Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, is reported to be preparing a new bid to become Prime Minister as Mrs May's grip on No. 10 becomes increasingly fragile. But he has responded in typically colourful fashion, tweeting: ""Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa may. Let's get on with the job."" Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa may. Let's get on with the job And his spokesman added: ""The Foreign Secretary is 100% supporting the Prime Minister and working with her to get the best deal for Britain."" But the leadership speculation confirms just how politically wounded the Prime Minister has suddenly become. A buoyant Jeremy Corbyn, however, says in an interview with the Sunday Mirror: ""I can still be Prime Minister. This is still on. Absolutely. ""Theresa May has been to the palace. She's now attempting to form a government. She's then got to present a programme to Parliament. ""There's a possibility of voting the Queen's Speech down and we're going to push that all the way. ""We have got a mandate to deal with issues of poverty, justice and inequality in Britain. We want to end austerity and invest in this country and that's what we're going to do. ""Nearly 13 million people voted for us to do it. That's why I'm here."""

Their departures from Downing Street came as Tory MPs demanded the Prime Minister to change her governing style in the wake of the election meltdown. The Prime Minister has also been criticised for investing too much power in the pair, who were notorious in Westminster for fiercely guarding Mrs May. But who are the duo, known as ""NiFi"" by some? :: LIVE: May's top aides quit after poll upset Nick Timothy The Birmingham-born son of a steel worker and school assistant, Mr Timothy is a passionate supporter of Aston Villa and a keen cricket fan. Like Mrs May he attended a grammar school, where it is suggested he first developed his Conservative beliefs - having noticed that if Labour had won the 1992 election they intended to shut his school. He then studied at Sheffield University, becoming the first member of his family to enter higher education, before entering politics. Mr Timothy is described as ""anti-Establishment"" in his beliefs, with his political hero being the radical 19th century mayor of Birmingham Joseph Chamberlain - about whom he has written a short biography. He worked as a Conservative researcher at the party's central office before becoming special adviser to Mrs May at the Home Office. A row over his refusal, as a publicly funded employee, to campaign for the Conservatives at a by-election in 2014 saw him ousted from the Home Office amid tensions between Mrs May and David Cameron. He was also barred from the Tories' candidates list for the 2015 General Election. Mr Timothy went on to work for the New Schools Network, a charity promoting free schools, and voted to leave the EU in 2016. He was appointed Mrs May's joint chief of staff in July 2016 after the Brexit vote led to her election as Tory leader and Prime Minister. Martin Selmayr, the powerful chief of staff to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, suggested the 37-year-old had been sacrificed by the Prime Minister so she can cling to power despite throwing away her House of Commons' majority. :: May's top aides pay the price after gamble backfires Fiona Hill Unfairly or not, Ms Hill has become known as the Prime Minister's defender-in-chief. The 43-year-old was born in Greenock, in the west of Scotland, and was state educated in Glasgow. She entered journalism as the sole female football writer for the Daily Record, before moving on to The Scotsman where she once praised the power of kitten heels - a favourite of Mrs May - in an article. Ms Hill entered TV journalism with Sky News and then moved to work for the Conservative press office while the party was in opposition. After a brief interlude at the British Chambers of Commerce, she returned to work for the Tory party and soon became special adviser to Mrs May at the Home Office, where she teamed up with Mr Timothy. Perhaps due to her own fondness for fashion, Ms Hill was often branded Mrs May's style adviser among her many other duties. It is also said Mrs May's focus on tackling modern slavery at the Home Office was a result of Ms Hill. Known by her married name of Fiona Cunningham at the time, Ms Hill was forced to resign from the Home Office in 2014 following a spectacular row with then education secretary Michael Gove over Islamic extremism in state schools. Ms Hill was revealed to have been the source of briefing against Mrs May's Cabinet rival. She went on to work for a lobbying firm before returning to Government - and having reverted to her birth name after a divorce - to link up with Mrs May and Mr Timothy again in Downing Street last summer. Since that time, Ms Hill's reputation as a fierce protector of the Prime Minister grew, getting involved in a furious text exchange with Nicky Morgan after the senior Tory MP criticised Mrs May's £1,000 leather trousers."

It also intercepted two B-1B Lancers and a KC-135R Stratotanker. The alliance is currently running its annual Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) exercise, a multinational, maritime-focused live training event which first began in 1972, in the region close to Russia's border. A Russian foreign ministry official said the appearance of the B-52H would not ease tensions between the West and Moscow. The ministry said the SU-27 approached at a safe distance, identified the aircraft as an American B-52 strategic bomber, and escorted it until it changed course and flew away from the border area. The Russian government-controlled news agency Sputnik quoted Mikhail Ulyanov, the director of the Russian Foreign Ministry, as stating that a number of the strategic bombers had been relocated to the UK to take part in the BALTOPS exercises. Mr Ulyanov said: ""The fact that NATO forces are converging near Russia's borders and carrying out military exercises supported by strategic bombers from the USA capable of carrying nuclear weapons hardly helps de-escalate tensions in Europe."" A statement from the US military claimed the exercise was taking place in international airspace. ""We can confirm that the US Air Force B-52 was operating in international airspace but we don't have any information to provide at this time regarding the behavior of Russian aircraft,"" Air Force spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said."

Former Tory MP Gavin Barwell will replace the duo as Mrs May's new Downing Street chief of staff. The ex-housing minister served in the Government until losing his Croydon Central seat on Thursday night. Mr Timothy acknowledged that one of his regrets was the way the party's controversial social care reforms, dubbed a ""dementia tax"" by critics, had been handled. :: LIVE: All the fallout from the General Election Mrs May was forced into a u-turn within days of unveiling the policy in the Tory manifesto, announcing that there would be a cap on care costs, something which had not been in the original policy document. In a resignation message on the ConservativeHome website, Mr Timothy said: ""I take responsibility for my part in this election campaign, which was the oversight of our policy programme. ""In particular, I regret the decision not to include in the manifesto a ceiling as well as a floor in our proposal to help meet the increasing cost of social care. :: 'Matter of time' before May's minority government crumbles ""But I would like to make clear that the bizarre media reports about my own role in the policy's inclusion are wrong: it had been the subject of many months of work within Whitehall, and it was not my personal pet project. ""I chose not to rebut these reports as they were published, as to have done so would have been a distraction for the campaign. ""But I take responsibility for the content of the whole manifesto, which I continue to believe is an honest and strong programme for government."" :: Sky Views: Ruthless Tories will see off 'loser' May Ms Hill said in a statement: ""It's been a pleasure to serve in government, and a pleasure to work with such an excellent Prime Minister. ""I have no doubt at all that Theresa May will continue to serve and work hard as Prime Minister - and do it brilliantly."" Announcing Mr Barwell as her new Downing Street chief of staff, Mrs May hailed his ""considerable experience"" of the Conservative Party. Mr Barwell, who also served as minister for London until this week, worked in a number of roles in Conservative central office between 1993 and 2010, when he was elected an MP. The Prime Minister said Mr Barwell would have an ""important role"" in reflecting on the General Election result and ""why it did not deliver the result I hoped for"". A ""thrilled"" Mr Barwell said: ""I voted for Theresa May to become Prime Minister. ""I believe she is the best person to heal the divisions in our country that last year's referendum and the General Election have laid bare, getting the best Brexit deal for the whole country and leading us towards a brighter future outside the EU."" :: Election results: How did your constituency vote? Mrs May is attempting to shore up her position in Number 10 as the head of a minority government and has sent her Chief Whip Gavin Williamson to lead talks with the Democratic Unionist Party. The PM has made clear she wants support from her ""friends and allies"" in Northern Ireland's DUP to secure her administration ahead of the Queen's Speech on 19 June. She is expected to make further appointments to her Cabinet this weekend, but a full-scale reshuffle is off the table given the damage done to Mrs May's standing by the election result. Philip Hammond, who was tipped to be removed as Chancellor if the Conservatives won a healthy majority, will remain at the Treasury. :: Tears, kisses and Mr Fishfinger - A momentous election night in pictures Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon will also stay where they are. Although the PM is working on the reshuffle of her ministerial team, further appointments are not expected to be made on Saturday, with the Government's focus on talks with DUP. As Mrs May clings on to power, there is disquiet within her party about the link-up with the DUP, which opposes same-sex marriage and abortion.

Edwards and Markham have been jailed for a minimum of 17-and-a-half years each for the ""brutal executions"" of Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her 13-year-old daughter Katie. Both were stabbed in the neck by Markham with a kitchen knife. The pair spent the 36 hours after the killings having sex, sharing a bath and watching the Twilight films. The ban on naming the pair was lifted by Sir Brian Leveson, Mr Justice Blake and Mr Justice Lewis. Sir Brian said: ""In the circumstances of this case, notwithstanding that the appellants are only 15 years of age, we have no doubt that the lifting of reporting restrictions is in accordance with law, pursues a legitimate aim and is a reasonable and proportionate measure."" He added that the naming allowed ""the full facts and circumstances"" of the case to become public. Sir Brian said the pair were ""besotted with each other"" and unhappy in their family homes. Edwards bore grudges towards her mother and sister which Markham came to share, leading them to ""jointly"" decide to kill Mrs Markham and ""entirely innocent"" Katie. The plot was apparently hatched in a McDonald's. Sir Brian said: ""The reality is that anonymity lasts only until 18 years of age and both appellants face a very considerable term of detention that will stretch long into their adult life.

That government lasted a few months, now all the talk in Westminster is of another General Election, just as in the two elections of 1974. In the second, October 1974 election, Wilson managed to gain 18 further seats and win a slender majority of four. He went to the country and asked them to give him a proper mandate. But Wilson had an advantage May doesn't. He was in opposition and defeated an incumbent PM in that election, Ted Heath. Wilson therefore was on the advance. May, by contrast, is in No 10 already, and went backwards already in the election. Tories therefore are believed to be terrified of another poll. They think Jeremy Corbyn has the wind at his back and could win yet more seats. They have reason to be worried. I've been crunching the numbers and sifting through Britain's new electoral geography. It doesn't make for happy reading for the Tories. There are now 29 Conservative seats in England and Wales which have majorities of less than 2,000 - and 17 of these have majorities of less than 1000. These range across the country, from Southampton Itchen in the south (majority 31) through to Pendle (majority 1,279) in the North. These seats would take only the smallest swing to Labour from the Conservatives for Jeremy Corbyn to win them. And if they did, Labour would become the largest party in parliament. By contrast, in the 2015-17 parliament there were only 19 Conservative seats with majorities of less than 2,000 - and the Tories lost 14 of them on Thursday. The Conservatives were supposed to be on the march at this election, instead they find themselves living up to their namesake and trying to conserve the seats they have. Should they be forced to put those at risk at yet another election, the electoral terrain they survey will be anything but favourable. The 30 Tory seats with the slimmest majorities 1. Southampton Itchen (31 majority, Labour second)2. Richmond Park (45 majority, Lib Dems second)3. Stirling (148 majority, SNP second)4. St Ives (312 majority, Lib Dems second)5.

Sky's Ireland correspondent David Blevins said: ""If they're going to squeeze out some concession from the Tories, is that concession going to frustrate Sinn Fein to the point where the prospect of devolution disappears and there is direct rule from Westminster again in Northern Ireland - with the potential of that direct rule being imposed by a Tory government shored up by the Democratic Unionists. ""You really couldn't make it up."" Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP's chief whip, has said the hung parliament ""puts us in a very strong negotiating position"". But what does the party stand for and what is it likely to demand to enable the Tories to form an administration? :: Brexit While it campaigned to leave the EU, the DUP is keen to maintain a ""frictionless border"" with the Irish Republic, because of the commercial benefits it brings. The party's leader Arlene Foster has spoken out against a ""hard Brexit"", which could threaten this, and so will almost certainly make this a red line. The party also called in its manifesto for an ""appropriate support programme"" for Northern Ireland farmers after Brexit. EU agricultural subsidies are worth about £350m a year and so a guarantee on this could form a part of any deal at Westminster. It also called for a ""fair share"" for Northern Ireland from dividends from leaving the EU. :: Tax While wanting to maintain close links with the UK, the staunchly pro-union party wants the power to reduce its cooperation tax rate to at least 12.5%, in line with the Republic. :: Pensions The DUP backs the continuation of the ""triple lock"" on retirement payouts, which the Tories had proposed to ditch. :: Benefits It has also pledged to ""resist any assault"" on universal benefits such as the the winter fuel allowance, which the Conservatives also wanted to curb.

The 83-year-old died suddenly in hospital on Thursday, having recently celebrated his 50th wedding anniversary. Mr Panopoulos had a number of successful restaurants with his brothers when he first threw together the unlikely ingredients at his Chatham restaurant in 1962. ""Nobody liked it at first,"" he told Canadian broadcaster CBC earlier this year. ""But after that, they went crazy about it, because (in) those days nobody was mixing sweet and sour and all that. It was plain, plain food."" Little did he know it would eventually become a fixture on pizza menus all over the world. The Hawaiian name is said to have come from the can of pineapples used the first time the iconic pizza was created. Mr Panopoulos' creation was ridiculed in February by the leader of a country rather far from Hawaii - Iceland. President Guoni Johannesson told schoolchildren he was ""fundamentally opposed"" to pineapple on pizza and said he wished he could ban it.

But as she stood waiting for the declaration in her Maidenhead constituency just before 3.30am, the Prime Minister had a face like thunder. When she spoke, her voice was cracking. She sounded - as well as looked - badly shaken. She must know her days as Prime Minister are numbered. By calling for a ""period of stability"" in her acceptance speech, she sounded as if she was pleading with Conservative MPs not to move to oust her just yet. :: Hung parliament: What happens when no one wins? Oh dear! Her gamble of a snap election to win a Brexit mandate had horribly backfired. Despite her plea, members of her Cabinet were already plotting. Close allies like Ben Gummer had lost their seats and the woman some saw as a potential Chancellor and future Tory leader, Amber Rudd, was taken to two recounts. Many Tories would claim it was no more than the pipsqueak Gummer deserved. After all, they would argue, he was the clown who wrote the vote-losing manifesto. :: Hung parliament could jeopardise Brexit timetable A week ago, some were tipping him for promotion to the Cabinet and possibly even taking over as Brexit Secretary from David Davis. Rough old game, politics. But it wasn't just the Conservatives who suffered big-name casualties. Back in 1997, the cry went up: ""Were you still up for Portillo?"" At the last election, in 2015, the question was whether you were you still up for Ed Balls and Vince Cable. This time, perhaps the most stunning casualty was Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister. Not surprisingly, his face was a picture of gloom and dejection as it became clear that he was crashing to defeat. It must have hurt even more because just as he was losing in Sheffield Hallam, Vince Cable was winning back his old Twickenham seat. Later, another Lib Dem member of the 2010-15 Coalition cabinet, Ed Davey, won his old seat back, too. Then, within an hour of predicting that Theresa May would be gone within 48 hours, Alex Salmond lost his seat in Aberdeenshire, following the defeat of the SNP's Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, earlier. Contrast the mood in Maidenhead with that in Islington. We should have known something was up when we saw two police officers standing guard outside Mr Corbyn's home just before 10pm. Did somebody tip off the Metropolitan Police that the Labour leader's status was about to be enhanced by the shock exit poll predicting a hung Parliament? Earlier this week, Mr Corbyn sounded rather foolish when two days before polling day he called on the Prime Minister to resign over cuts in police manpower. He sounded much more convincing when, in his victory speech in Islington, he called on her to quit after the election results showed Labour holding on to seats the party previously thought were vulnerable to the Tories. Back in Maidenhead, Mrs May faced - and ignored - questions over whether she was going to resign as she arrived in the hall for the result of her count. Who would have thought as recently as two days ago that it would be Theresa May facing questions about her future on election night and not Jeremy Corbyn? Despite Mr Corbyn's better than expected performance, however, there will be plenty of Labour MPs who will claim that with a better leader the party could have won a handsome election victory. But that's churlish. Mr Corbyn, too, was looking his smartest on election night: a neat, dark suit and a red tie as bright as Theresa May's lipstick. He's never going to be a fashion icon. But he does seem to have heeded the advice David Cameron passed on from his mother at PMQs last year: ""Put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem."" He's done the first two. He just needs to learn to do the third! And as for Theresa May, after results like these, she's left with a face as red as her crimson lipstick and Mr Corbyn's tie."

He succeeds Jeff Immelt, who has notched up 16 years in the role, a thoroughly impressive stint and in no way diminished by the fact this Mr Immelt's predecessor, Jack Welch, managed 20 years in the job. Despite being somewhat eclipsed in size during the last decade or so by tech titans like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook, GE is still America's 11th biggest company by market capitalisation, with a value of $243bn. It employs 333,000 people globally, including 22,000 in the UK, where it generates annual sales of $5bn and reckons to be the country's third largest industrial business. GE boasts a stupendous history. Its origins date back to the launch of the machine-moulded electric light bulb in 1892 by Thomas Edison, America's greatest-ever inventor, while it is the only one of the dozen founding members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896 that is still in the index. Over the years, it has been a pioneer in x-rays, television sets, turbines and, using technology developed by Britain's Sir Frank Whittle, it built America's first jet engines. Its activities these days sprawl across power generation, aviation, lighting, healthcare, digital and financial services. In other words, this is a big beast of the corporate world, making the appointment of a new boss absolutely critical. By plumping for Mr Flannery, 55, GE is adopting the same tactic - in hiring from within - that it did when Mr Immelt, 61, was appointed. Mr Immelt had been with GE for 19 years at the time of his appointment; Mr Flannery has been at the company for 30 years, much of that at GE Capital, the financial services arm. Moreover, like Mr Immelt, Mr Flannery has most recently been running GE's healthcare division at the time of his appointment, although in Mr Immelt's day, it was known as GE Medical Systems. The challenges facing Mr Flannery, though, differ from those of his predecessor. When Mr Immelt became CEO, his biggest challenge was escaping the shadow of Mr Welch, a man under whom GE was regularly named ""the world's most admired company"" and who was described by The Economist, no less, as ""the Princess Diana of business"". During his two decades at the top, Mr Welch - nicknamed ""Neutron Jack"" for the way he could leave buildings intact while removing the employees in them - took GE's annual sales from $25bn to $111bn and its annual profits from $1.4bn to $11bn, while somehow managing to keep GE's unusual spread of businesses together at a time when its rivals were having to focus or break themselves up. Mr Welch was a brutal boss, firing the bottom 10% of GE's managers each year regardless of how well the company was performing as a whole, but he got results. GE increased its profits every quarter that he was in charge. When Mr Immelt took the helm, he was almost immediately forced to manage the business through the shocking aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, which not only cost the company's insurance division an estimated $600m but also battered demand for the company's jet engines. Subsequent shocks through which he had to navigate included the financial crisis. During his time in office, he has remodelled GE, selling its property and consumer finance divisions, the latter of which racked up huge losses during the financial crisis that almost capsized its parent. He also sold the broadcaster NBC Universal to Comcast, the cable operator, and GE's appliances business, which was offloaded to Electrolux of Sweden. Taking their place as having greater strategic value was healthcare, which was pumped up by the 2003 acquisition of British healthcare technology company Amersham for £5.7bn and energy, on which Mr Immelt spent getting on for $25bn in acquisitions. That latter bet, arguably, has yet to pay off amid the downturn in global energy prices. Getting the most out of that business will be one of Mr Flannery's key challenges. Another will be coming to an accommodation with Nelson Peltz, the feared corporate raider, who has taken a 1% stake in the business and has been agitating for change. Running GE is a well-paid activity. Mr Immelt took home $27m last year, down from $33m in 2015 and $37m in 2014. But simply running a business of the size and complexity of GE would challenge most executives. Wringing growth out of GE's disparate arms, stepping up the company's exposure to new technology and proving that its conglomerate model still has relevance in the 21st century will be tougher still."
2017-06-11,"Business confidence has plunged because of the political uncertainty gripping the nation following the election, a lobby group has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612154445/http://news.sky.com/story/business-leaders-warn-a-parliament-in-paralysis-would-be-disastrous-for-uk-economy-10913076,"The hung parliament has triggered a ""dramatic drop"" in confidence, according to a survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD). A snap poll of its 700 members found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the UK economy since its last survey in May. The majority cited Brexit and growing concerns about the country's immigration system once Britain leaves the European Union as a priority issue for Theresa May's minority government to address. In particular, employers voiced worries about a future talent drain and demanded clarity on the status of EU workers in the UK, coupled with a plan for a higher skilled domestic workforce. They said they were keen to see quick agreement with the EU on transitional arrangements surrounding the UK's withdrawal, with a new trade deal an overall priority. Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD, said if the current political uncertainty was not addressed it would be ""disastrous for the UK economy"". The loss of Mrs May's Commons majority means her team is in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party to enter into a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement to keep the Conservatives in power. Some 69% of business leaders said there was little appetite for a further election later this year and the last thing UK business needed was a ""Parliament in paralysis"". They urged all parties to ""swallow their pride and work on a cross-party basis on the most important issues"". Mr Martin said: ""The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new Government. ""It was disheartening that the only reference the Prime Minister made to prosperity in her Downing Street statement was to emphasise the need to share it, rather than create it in the first place. ""With global headwinds and political uncertainty at the front of business leaders' minds, it would be wise for this administration to re-emphasise its commitment to a pro-business environment here at home."" He added: ""Business leaders are keener to see the new Government get to work in Brussels and on the domestic front. Ensuring negotiations start well, and delivering higher quality skills and infrastructure across the country, must be the priority."""
2017-06-11,A new study will look at how setting a 20mph speed limit affects safety and public health.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612154445/http://news.sky.com/story/study-to-examine-use-of-20mph-speed-limit-in-built-up-areas-10913019,"Researchers will evaluate how the policy of reducing the limit from 30mph has worked in parts of Edinburgh and Belfast, and rates of traffic accidents and injuries before and after the change will be measured to determine whether road safety has been improved. Led by the University of Edinburgh and the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy, the project could be used to advise other cities considering a reduction in speed limits. The study is the largest of its kind in the UK and will run until 2020. Dr Ruth Jepson, from the university's Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, said: ""We are excited to launch this major project, which we hope will provide very important insights into the public health effects of such initiatives. ""We anticipate that our broad focus will generate a wealth of evidence and learning that will be invaluable for informing future roll-outs of similar schemes in the UK and around the world."" The study is funded by the National Institute for Health Research and involves a partnership with other UK universities, NHS Health Scotland and the charity Sustrans. Green MSP Mark Ruskell has launched a consultation on a Members' Bill to change the default speed limit in built-up areas across Scotland from 30mph to 20mph. He said: ""This is a very timely study and I'm confident the report's findings will help the case we're making in the Scottish Parliament to introduce 20mph speed limits in built-up areas across Scotland. ""By bringing forward legislation I want to create safer streets so we reduce the risk for pedestrians and cyclists, especially children and the elderly."""
2017-06-11,"British employers are ""totally unprepared"" for a fall in migration once Britain leaves the EU, a study has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612154445/http://news.sky.com/story/firms-totally-unprepared-for-post-brexit-migration-fall-think-tank-finds-10913092,"Around a third of firms expect the current system of freedom of movement for EU nationals to the UK to remain the same so long as they have a job offer., according to a survey of 500 businesses who employ EU nationals by the think tank Resolution Foundation. A quarter expect their migrant workforce to increase, roughly the same proportion are also expecting numbers to fall, while almost half of employers do not expect any change during the next 12 months. The Foundation said these expectations were ""unrealistic"" given that Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to cut immigration to the tens of thousands. It said lower migration, coupled with a higher minimum wage and a tightening jobs market, could put an end to the era of readily-available cheap labour that has characterised the UK labour market in recent years. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""As the fallout from last week's election rumbles on, the new government will need to be making fast preparations for Brexit negotiations that start in just seven days' time. ""But it's not just government that needs to step up preparation for Brexit. ""Many British firms are totally unprepared for this change, particularly when it comes to migration. Ministers have compounded this uncertainty by choosing not to answer questions over what a post-Brexit immigration regime might be. ""Whatever people's views on Brexit, the journey, not just the destination, matter hugely to growth, jobs and living standards. ""Now is the time for both firms and government to focus on how we navigate that journey and the changes to our labour market it brings."" Mrs May is sticking by her controversial pledge to reduce net migration to below 100,000, something that was last achieved in 1997. Britain's Brexit deal following its departure from the bloc is expected to include restrictions on free movement rules, although the precise arrangements are yet to be decided."

Detective Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson confirmed 29 house searches have been conducted over the past three weeks - and evidence of explosive material has been found at several locations with links to Abedi. Officers are appealing for information about red and blue barrels which were stored in a Nissan Micra that Abedi had made ""repeated trips"" to before his attack. A search is also continuing at a landfill site for a blue suitcase which may contain ""crucial evidence"" that the 22-year-old discarded after assembling the bomb. Mr Jackson said: ""Our enquiries show that the assembly of the device is likely to have been by Abedi himself. What is less clear is whether he acted alone in obtaining the materials for the device...and whether others knew or were complicit in the storage of materials knowing what was being planned."" He also revealed that Abedi was identified within two hours of detonating the bomb in Manchester city centre which killed 22 people. Police now have a ""deep understanding"" of the terrorist's movements in the weeks leading up to the attack. Abedi had visited Libya on 15 April and returned on 18 May. Officers also know that he tried to send money out of the UK in the days leading up to the bombing. Mr Jackson added that British police want to interview Hasham Abedi, the attacker's brother, who is currently being detained in Libya. Some 22 people have been arrested in connection with the bombing, but all of them have been released without charge. The bomb - which was packed with a ""massive number"" of small metal objects to kill as many people as possible - claimed the lives of 22 people, and injured dozens of others. More than 1,000 officers have so far been involved in the ongoing investigation, with 8,000 entries on police logging system and at least 700 devices, such as phones, seized for examination."
2017-06-11,The number of nurses from the European Union registering to work in the UK has fallen by 96% since the Brexit vote last year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612154445/http://news.sky.com/story/applications-from-eu-nurses-to-work-in-uk-down-96-since-brexit-vote-10913295,"Figures collated by the Nursing & Midwifery Council show that the number of new applicants from the EU fell from 1,304 in July last year to just 46 in April this year. The dramatic fall in applicants to work in the UK is likely to place more pressure on the NHS as it grapples with a recruitment crisis, and increase political pressure to secure a guarantee for NHS staff from Brexit negotiations. There are an estimated 57,000 EU nationals working for the NHS, around 20,000 of whom are nurses. International staff have helped fill NHS vacancies for several years as the UK has struggled to recruit, train and retain enough homegrown staff, with EU nationals providing the majority. The Health Foundation, which obtained the figures following a Freedom of Information request, said the fall in EU applicants could impact patient care, with an overall shortage of around 30,000 nurses. Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, said: ""The recruitment and retention of nurses is one of the biggest challenges facing health and social care, with a shortage of 30,000 nurses in England alone. ""The drop in EU nurses registering to work in the UK could not be more stark - just 46 registered to work in the UK in April. ""Without EU nurses it will be even harder for the NHS and other employers to find the staff they need to provide safe patient care. The findings should be a wake-up call to politicians and health service leaders. ""But the overall shortage of 30,000 nurses is not a shortage caused by the Brexit vote. The chronic shortage of nurses is the result of years of short-term planning and cuts to training places. ""A sustainable, long-term approach to workforce planning is desperately needed."" Labour shadow health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said the NHS should be a priority in Brexit negotiations, which begin next week. ""Theresa May's weak and unstable government has pushed NHS services to the brink and it is patients who will pay the price,"" he said. ""Our health service has always relied on the contribution of overseas workers yet these staff are being forced out by this Government's neglect and disregard,"" he said. ""The Tories are overseeing an unforgivable drain of talent out of our country because of their chaotic attitude to the Brexit negotiations. The truth is that Theresa May has tried to use NHS staff as bargaining chips in her negotiations with Brussels. ""The NHS should be a priority in the Brexit negotiations and the Government should immediately guarantee the rights of EU staff who are working here in our health and care service."" The Department of Health is preparing a response to the Health Foundation statement."

His arrest is linked to the killing of Gareth Hutch, who is the nephew of notorious Irish criminal Gerry 'The Monk' Hutch. The 35-year-old was shot dead outside his home in May 2016 - just a few hundred yards from O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare. His murder was the latest killing in the ongoing Kinahan-Hutch gang feud, which has claimed the lives of 12 people since it started with the murder of Gary Hutch in Spain two years ago. Gary Hutch was also a nephew of Gerry Hutch, who is suspected of masterminding the two biggest armed robberies in the history of the Irish state. A 39-year-old woman, Regina Keogh, has been charged with that murder. Five months later, an audacious gun attack at Dublin's Regency Hotel during the weigh-in for a boxing match took place, in what is believed to have been a retaliation attack. One man was killed and two others injured after gunmen carrying AK-47 rifles burst into the hotel reception and opened fire. The man killed in the incident - David Byrne from the Crumlin area of Dublin - was an associate of the Kinahan family. The following month, a man in County Meath in the north of the city was killed in what was believed to be part of the ongoing turf war. The 55-year-old - who was a close friend of Gerry 'The Monk' Hutch - was shot while sitting in his car. In August 2016, Trevor O'Neill was shot while on a family holiday in Majorca in what was believed to be a case of mistaken identity. The Irish 40-year-old was shot in the back while outside a supermarket in the Costa de la Calma resort with his wife and three young children."

During the 11-minute opening number, he donned tap shoes and numerous costumes as he parodied the Broadway shows nominated for awards on Sunday night. ""I can't believe how many people do that eight times a week,"" a breathless Spacey said afterwards. ""But that's why we're gathered here to celebrate all the incredible work that you do. Now if someone will please find my cardiologist."" His opening performance started with a parody of a song from hit musical Dear Evan Hansen. Spacey dressed as its title character, an anxious teenager - but he adapted the lyrics to reference his hosting concerns. ""Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of going live on air? Have you ever felt the ratings could disappear?"" Spacey was named as Tony host after several other celebrities turned the job down. Comedian Stephen Colbert joined Spacey on stage to riff on Groundhog Day, while former Tonys host Whoopi Goldberg was on hand to help him with his Come From Away parody. He referenced speculation about her sexuality as he joked, ""How long have you been in that closet, Whoopi?"" She replied: ""Depends on who you ask, Kevin."" He went on to make light of rumours about his own sexuality by dressing as Sunset Boulevard's Norma Desmond. ""I'm coming out,"" he sang in a black and gold dress, before adding: ""Wait, no, wait."" Spacey also poked fun at US presidential candidate Hilary Clinton during the ceremony. Dressed as her husband Bill, Spacey referenced the plot of Dear Evan Hansen, which sees the teenager write fake emails to integrate himself into the family of a classmate who dies by suicide. He addressed the musical's star, saying: ""Ben Platt was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People. That's very impressive. I was on that list a couple times, but, Ben, you know who you bumped off that list? My wife. ""Now, between you and me, you might be a better singer. But after seeing your show, there's no doubt that Hillary is much better at creating fake email accounts than you."" While in character, he also joked about recent US election result: ""We've already had some surprising winners haven't we? I'm not even talking about the Tony Awards."" Dear Evan Hansen scooped the most Tony Awards of all the nominees, including Best New Musical. It also took home Best Orchestration, Best Book of a Musical. Platt fought off tough competition from stars in Groundhog Day and Falsettos to win Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical. Bette Midler took the equivalent award for actresses for her role in Hello, Dolly! She gave a four-minute acceptance speech that forced organisers to play music over the top in an attempt to drive her off stage. But the actress was having none of it, shouting to rapturous laughter: ""Shut that crap off!"" Hello, Dolly! also took home Best Revival of a Musical, and Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Musical. Best Play was won by Oslo, while a Tony went to August Wilson's Jitney for Best Revival of a Play."

It was the first time an England side had reached a world final since Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst and company won the Jules Rimet Trophy at Wembley in 1966. In a dramatic, open game, Paul Simpson's Young Lions were indebted to Newcastle goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, who saved a penalty from Venezuela's Adalberto Penaranda 16 minutes from the end. England started brightly and had the first chance when Dominic Solanke fluffed his shot after a defensive blunder put him through on the Venezuela goalkeeper. England continued to press, with Ademola Lookman forcing a flying save from Wuilker Farinez with a fierce shot from outside the area. But the South Americans went even closer minutes later, when Ronaldo Lucena's swerving free kick hit the post. Calvert-Lewin broke the deadlock 10 minutes before the break, beating Farinez at the second attempt after reacting first to Lewis Cook's half-cleared free kick. Venezuela had more of the ball in the second half but England might have doubled their lead when Josh Onomah broke into the opposition half and, with no pass on, thumped a long-range shot against the bar. The ball bounced agonisingly in front of the line and was cleared. Venezuela then spurned a golden chance to equalise in the 74th minute when Woodman palmed away Penaranda's penalty despite having initially dived in the opposite direction. The victory is bound to focus attention on the underwhelming performances of the senior side at recent tournaments, especially the disappointing exit from last year's European Championships after losing to Iceland. It comes the day after England needed an added time goal by new captain Harry Kane to rescue a 2-2 draw against Scotland in Glasgow. Congratulations @England u20's!

Mr Wilman told the Sunday Mirror: ""Jeremy and James both raced down to the scene of the crash as soon as it happened. ""When they saw the wreckage on fire they thought Richard was dead.

A spokesperson for The Grand Tour said: ""Richard was conscious and talking, and climbed out of the car himself before the vehicle burst into flames. ""He was flown by air ambulance to hospital in St Gallen to be checked over - revealing a fracture to his knee. ""Nobody else was in the car or involved in the accident, and we'd like to thank the paramedics on site for their swift response. ""The cause of the crash is unknown and is being investigated."" Hammond was racing a Rimac Concept One car, built in Croatia, during the Hemburg Hill Climb. It was filmed as part of the second series of The Grand Tour, the Amazon Prime programme Hammond, Clarkson and May joined after leaving the BBC's Top Gear in 2015. According to the car manufacturer's website, the Concept One can reach a maximum speed of 220mph thanks to its 1,224 horsepower motor. The Hemburg Hill Climb takes place over a one-mile-long course, which climbs 157m (515ft). Contestants average speeds of more than 70mph. In 2006, Hammond suffered brain injuries after crashing a jet-propelled car while travelling at close to 300mph. The horror accident left him in intensive care, where he was in a coma for two weeks."

2017-06-11,"Consumer spending slipped back annually for the first time in nearly four years last month as shoppers turned more cautious in the face of ""rising prices and stalling wages"", new figures reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612154445/http://news.sky.com/story/first-fall-in-consumer-spending-since-2013-10913261,"Spending fell by 0.8% year-on-year in May - the first annual fall since September 2013, according to Visa's consumer spending index. Last month's drop followed a 0.3% increase in April. Spending on clothing and footwear declined by 5.2% annually in May, and was down 4.1% on household goods. There was also a marginal decline of 0.6% in spending on food and drink. The fall was driven by a 5.3% fall in ""bricks and mortar"" spending on the high street, but online spending was up by 6.9% year-on-year. Kevin Jenkins, UK and Ireland managing director at Visa, said: ""Our index clearly shows that with rising prices and stalling wage growth, more of us are starting to feel the squeeze. ""Bricks and mortar retailers had a particularly challenging month, with sales dropping at the quickest level in over five years, at a time when warmer weather and the May bank holidays would usually drive shoppers on to the high street."" However, figures showed shoppers were spending more money on experiences than goods. Visa recorded a 3.3% increase on spending on hotels, bars and restaurants, plus a 2.2% rise in recreation and culture - although the data indicated a marked slowdown in these areas from 9.1% and 2.8% the previous month, respectively. Mr Jenkins said the softer rates suggested ""consumers were reining in their discretionary spending"". The tough times facing UK retailers come amid rising inflation, which climbed to 2.7% in April - its highest level for nearly four years - with the squeeze on household budgets intensifying at a time when wage growth is stuttering. In real terms - taking into account inflation - wages fell by 0.2% in the first three months of 2017, the first time there has been a decline for two-and-a-half years. Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the index, said: ""The outlook for consumer spending continues to look relatively bleak, with households facing faster increases in living costs and muted wage growth. ""The squeeze on household finances is likely to get worse as the Bank of England forecasts faster increases in consumer prices in the coming months. ""Combined with relatively low levels of consumer confidence, uncertainty around the outcome of Brexit and a slowdown in UK economic growth, it's likely we will continue to see weaker expenditure trends at least in the near-term."" The official retail figures for May - month-on-month and year-on-year - are expected later this week."
2017-06-11,Iran has started sending fruit and vegetables to Qatar after Gulf nations cut trade links with the emirate.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612154445/http://news.sky.com/story/iran-flies-food-to-qatar-after-isolation-by-gulf-neighbours-10913235,"Iran's national carrier has already delivered 90 tons of food and flights will continue ""based on demand"". Three boats, carrying more than 350 tons of food, will also be leaving an Iranian port for Qatar, according to Tasnim news agency, quoting local officials. :: Analysis - UK fears Qatar blockade is hurting its people It was not clear whether the shipments were made as aid deliveries or as exports. The deliveries came nearly a week after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates began a blockade against Qatar, sparking an unprecedented diplomatic crisis. The Gulf states expelled Qatari nationals from their territory, cut trade links to the emirate and banned Qatar's national airline from their airspace. Egypt and Yemen followed in passing measures against Doha. The blockade was in retaliation for what the states claim is Qatari support for terrorist groups and close relations with Iran. Qatar denies the claims. It has hired John Ashcroft, the US Attorney General during the 9/11 attacks, to review its attempts to combat terrorism and terrorism funding. The peninsula, which is connected to Saudi Arabia, is heavily reliant on imports for food and before it was cut off from its neighbours brought in 80% of its supply from surrounding Gulf countries. The isolation measures have led to supermarket queues as citizens anticipated food shortages. Iran has opened up its airspace to around 100 new Qatari flights daily, upping its air traffic by 17% according to the official state news agency. Other states in the region have also stepped in. Kuwait, which is not joining in the blockade of Qatar, is pushing to adopt a mediating role in the rift. Turkey's parliament has also approved sending troops to be stationed in Qatar. The move to isolate Qatar followed a visit to Saudi Arabia by US President Donald Trump. Speaking in Washington on Friday, he told journalists that the ""nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level"". The US has, however, called on Gulf states to ""de-escalate"" the crisis. Saudi accuses Qatar of backing groups allied with Iran across the region, including Shiite militant groups in both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Saudi has also accused Qatar of supporting the Houthi rebels in Yemen, despite the fact that Doha is a member of a Saudi-led coalition bombing the group. The states involved in the blockade have released a list of 59 entities and individuals that they say are involved in ""terrorist"" activities. Qatar denies accusations that it provides financial support to groups like Islamic State and Al Qaeda, and defends its links with Iran and Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood."

He said he immediately clicked that it could be a terror attack. ""We ran down to the yard and started getting the team back in the vans,"" he said. ""It was like something out of a movie with police officers running everywhere. Everybody was jumping into cars, getting cars going."" The 41-year-old and his officers rushed to Borough High Street and made their way on foot to the market where the attackers were looking for people to kill. :: London attackers' fake suicide belts pictured ""We had some updates on the radio about at least three men attacking people with knives, but it wasn't really a clear situation and we were not really sure what to expect,"" he said. Inspector Cole said he saw walking wounded and people lying on the floor with cuts and stab injuries. ""I asked my officers to form a cordon to stop the public from going into the market, and that's when the shooting started just behind us. ""We had no idea what was going on, we didn't know if it was us shooting or if the bad guys had guns."" Inspector Cole said people were running out of the market screaming: ""I would described it as pandemonium really,"" said the officer. He also received warning over the radio that the attackers were wearing suicide vests. The married father-of-three set up a triage area in the Katzenjammers pub and shepherded members of the public into the basement. ""I spoke with the 200 frightened people and told them that there were armed officers outside, we were safe and we would evacuate them as soon as we could and I got a big round of applause. ""On my radio I could hear officers on London Bridge desperately calling for ambulances, they were doing CPR on people. ""I decided I had to get my medic up there to help, but I didn't know what the threat was to their safety. ""I managed to grab a couple of armed officers and they escorted my medic, and another police medic, up to London Bridge."" Inspector Cole said it was the worst thing he has seen. ""I've dealt with things over the years - people stabbed or murdered and death - but it was the sheer scale of it all,"" he said. A week after the attack, many people on Saturday paused by the sea of flowers as pubs metres away were busy again. People at The George said it was important to carry on as normal. A man who from Cardiff said: ""I just wanted to show solidarity. I'm a teacher, I'd discussed this with my year 6 pupils and I just wanted to show that all people across Great Britain are behind London and supporting peace, togetherness and solidarity."" Another said: ""They (the attackers) can't harm what London is. They can't do anything to change the fact that London is a great city. ""I'm not going to let someone with a crazy ideology change what I do on a Friday or Saturday night."" Many bars which took people in on the night of the attack re-opened on Sunday. Borough Market remains closed, but it is expected stalls will re-open in the coming days. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral, which is right at the centre of the attack scene, has told Sky News how he ran towards the mayhem hoping to open the cathedral to offer refuge - but he was turned back by police. ""I got as far as I could,"" he said, adding: ""Heavily armed police shoved me back and told me to 'run! run!'."" He went on: ""I was scared, terrified really. I have never experienced anything like that, I didn't think I would."" Meanwhile, it has emerged that Government guidance issued days after the attack warns hospitals and doctors surgeries that they too could be targeted by terrorists. The Crowded Places Guidance tells health providers: ""It is possible that your hospital or surgery for example could be the target of a terrorist incident... ""In the worst case scenario your staff, patients and visitors could be killed or injured, and your premises destroyed or damaged in a 'no warning', multiple and coordinated terrorist attack."""

The Queen is expected to attend Parliament a few days later to give the speech that reveals that year's legislative agenda. :: Live reaction to election fallout A Labour spokesperson responded: ""Number 10's failure to confirm the date of the Queen's Speech shows that this government is in chaos, as it struggles to agree a backroom deal with a party with abhorrent views on LGBT and women's rights."" Earlier, Brexit Secretary David Davis admitted that the Tories' election campaign ""went wrong"" and some manifesto pledges would be dropped or watered down. ""We'll have to look at the Queen's Speech and what we have to get through,"" he told Sky News. ""It has to be voted on in Parliament in a week's time; it's a matter of practicality. ""There may be things that we simply can't put in. That will happen. That will be going on as we speak. ""We will try to carry as much of the House with us as we can."" Mr Davis also suggested Theresa May could have to re-think her approach to Brexit after losing seats in the snap election, which she called in an attempt to strengthen her hand. ""80% of the public voted for parties that reflect, respect the decision last year,"" he said. ""Ones that wanted to reverse it or do something different got hammered. ""We don't want to leave the single market itself, it's the Europeans saying you can't lose free movements and keep it."" He added: ""The argument [of] 52-48% - We're trying to get a deal for the 100%."" Mr Davis' had previously said the General Election result would show whether the public ""accepted"" the Tories' vision of Brexit. He also dodged questions about a possible leadership challenge, as the poor results has increased speculation about Theresa May's future. Pressed on whether he wanted to replace her, Mr Davis said he was ""not interested in running for the leadership"", hailing Mrs May as ""a very good prime minister"". He did not respond to Sky News presenter Adam Boulton's suggestion: ""That's like saying Richard Hammond is a great driver."" The Conservatives have said they will deal with the pro-Brexit DUP to help them push laws through Parliament. The confidence and supply exchange will apply only to ""big issues"" like the economy and security, defence secretary Michael Fallon said."
2017-06-11,Microsoft has unveiled the next generation of its games console - the Xbox One X - which will be released later this year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612154445/http://news.sky.com/story/microsoft-announces-xbox-one-x-as-worlds-most-powerful-console-10913167,"Presenting the device to the E3 gaming conference in Los Angeles, Microsoft's Phil Spencer said the console will be launched worldwide on 7 November, costing $499 and £449. The console is going to compete with rivals on a graphical processing basis, shipping with six teraflops of graphical computing power running at 1172MHz. This exceeds by some distance the PS4 Pro's 4.2 teraflops at 911MHZ and sets a benchmark that may event tempt PC gamers towards the console. In addition to the console's support for 2160p (also known as 4K) visual display, Microsoft has claimed these features make the Xbox One X ""the most powerful console in the world"" - although it will also be the most expensive. While that graphical processing power will see the console compare very positively with gaming PCs in the same price range, it may struggle to help Microsoft win market share from Sony. Sales of Xbox consoles currently remain significantly behind those of the newer PlayStation models, which rumours suggest may be set to receive a price cut at Sony's E3 announcement on Monday. Formerly known by the code-name ""Project Scorpio"" the console will be completely backwards compatible with other Xbox games and peripherals, potentially endearing it to current Xbox One gamers. Mr Spencer, who is the head of Xbox at Microsoft, said the goal was to make Xbox users' games libraries look ever better, with better textures, smoother frame rates and faster load times. Microsoft showcased 42 titles at E3 which will be available at the same time as the console, including 22 exclusive games. Among the exclusive titles is Crackdown 3, the most recent release in the over-the-top open world action-adventure game franchise. Complementing the game's four player co-op mode came a comically expletive-laden trailer featuring actor Terry Crews as Commander Jaxon. Additional exclusive titles include Forza Motorsport 7, which of the announced titles seems the most capable of fully utilising the Xbox One X's graphical processing power."

These email messages contained financial and sensitive information about council staff, according to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The ICO, the UK's data regulator, said the hacker exploited the Heartbleed security bug - which had been widely reported on and patched months prior to the attack. Heartbleed was publicly disclosed in April 2014 and was described as ""catastrophic"" by a number of security researchers and led to warnings from government agencies around the world. The bug affected OpenSSL, a widely used implementation of a security protocol which users normally experience as a closed green padlock on their browsers indicating that their connection with a site is secure. The enormous number of services affected by the bug lead a Finnish researcher to coin the name Heartbleed, and register a website and design a logo to raise awareness, although this did not prevent the bug being used to attack websites including Mumsnet after it was made public. The data watchdog slammed the council for ""serious oversight"" during its IT outsourcing programme which left staff's emails open to the attack months after the bug had been disclosed and patched. Sally Anne Poole, the group enforcement manager at the ICO, said: ""This was a serious oversight on the part of Gloucester City Council. ""The attack happened when the organisation was outsourcing their IT systems. ""A lack of oversight of this outsourcing, along with inadequate security measures on sensitive emails, left them vulnerable to an attack."" The ICO's investigation found that the council did not have sufficient processes in place to ensure its systems had been updated while it changed its IT suppliers. It also claimed that an attacker contacted them following the breach claiming to be part of Anonymous, the hacking collective known for attacks on websites. The ICO told Sky News it could not be confident about this claim, however, as the attacker had never been identified and the emails have not been recovered. Ms Poole added: ""The council should have known that in the wrong hands, this type of sensitive information could cause substantial distress to staff. ""Businesses and organisations must understand they need to do everything they can to keep people's personal information safe and that includes being extra vigilant during periods of change or uncertainty."" Sky News has contacted Gloucester City Council for comment."

Led by the University of Edinburgh and the Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy, the project could be used to advise other cities considering a reduction in speed limits. The study is the largest of its kind in the UK and will run until 2020. Dr Ruth Jepson, from the university's Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, said: ""We are excited to launch this major project, which we hope will provide very important insights into the public health effects of such initiatives. ""We anticipate that our broad focus will generate a wealth of evidence and learning that will be invaluable for informing future roll-outs of similar schemes in the UK and around the world."" The study is funded by the National Institute for Health Research and involves a partnership with other UK universities, NHS Health Scotland and the charity Sustrans.

A snap poll of its 700 members found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the UK economy since its last survey in May. The majority cited Brexit and growing concerns about the country's immigration system once Britain leaves the European Union as a priority issue for Theresa May's minority government to address. In particular, employers voiced worries about a future talent drain and demanded clarity on the status of EU workers in the UK, coupled with a plan for a higher skilled domestic workforce. They said they were keen to see quick agreement with the EU on transitional arrangements surrounding the UK's withdrawal, with a new trade deal an overall priority. Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD, said if the current political uncertainty was not addressed it would be ""disastrous for the UK economy"". The loss of Mrs May's Commons majority means her team is in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party to enter into a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement to keep the Conservatives in power. Some 69% of business leaders said there was little appetite for a further election later this year and the last thing UK business needed was a ""Parliament in paralysis"". They urged all parties to ""swallow their pride and work on a cross-party basis on the most important issues"". Mr Martin said: ""The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new Government. ""It was disheartening that the only reference the Prime Minister made to prosperity in her Downing Street statement was to emphasise the need to share it, rather than create it in the first place. ""With global headwinds and political uncertainty at the front of business leaders' minds, it would be wise for this administration to re-emphasise its commitment to a pro-business environment here at home."" He added: ""Business leaders are keener to see the new Government get to work in Brussels and on the domestic front. Ensuring negotiations start well, and delivering higher quality skills and infrastructure across the country, must be the priority."""

It was the first time an England side had reached a world final since Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst and company won the Jules Rimet Trophy at Wembley in 1966. In a dramatic, open game, Paul Simpson's Young Lions were indebted to Newcastle goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, who saved a penalty from Venezuela's Adalberto Penaranda 16 minutes from the end. England started brightly and had the first chance when Dominic Solanke fluffed his shot after a defensive blunder put him through on the Venezuela goalkeeper. England continued to press, with Ademola Lookman forcing a flying save from Wuilker Farinez with a fierce shot from outside the area. But the South Americans went even closer minutes later, when Ronaldo Lucena's swerving free kick hit the post. Calvert-Lewin broke the deadlock 10 minutes before the break, beating Farinez at the second attempt after reacting first to Lewis Cook's half-cleared free kick. Venezuela had more of the ball in the second half but England might have doubled their lead when Josh Onomah broke into the opposition half and, with no pass on, thumped a long-range shot against the bar. The ball bounced agonisingly in front of the line and was cleared. Venezuela then spurned a golden chance to equalise in the 74th minute when Woodman palmed away Penaranda's penalty despite having initially dived in the opposite direction. The victory is bound to focus attention on the underwhelming performances of the senior side at recent tournaments, especially the disappointing exit from last year's European Championships after losing to Iceland. It comes the day after England needed an added time goal by new captain Harry Kane to rescue a 2-2 draw against Scotland in Glasgow. Congratulations @England u20's! Amazing achievement to be world champions! 🌎 🏆 #FIFAU20WC #YoungLions Kane, however, was quick to salute his younger colleagues, tweeting: ""Congratulations @England u20's!

The case is also against Blackpool FC Ltd itself and Blackpool FC (Properties) Ltd. The Oystons are vigorously denying the claims. The court heard that VB Football Assets, Mr Belekon's company and a minor shareholder in the club, was denied crucial information and a say in important decisions - as well as a share of profits. Speaking at the beginning of a five-week hearing, Mr Green said that Blackpool FC received an unprecedented influx of funds since entering the Premier League, including £48m in the 2010-11 season, followed by £58m after the club's relegation. ""Owen and Karl Oyston have treated Blackpool Football Club as the Oystons' personal cash machine,"" Mr Green told Mr Justice Marcus Smith, sitting in London. The case follows years of controversy surrounding the Oyston family's ownership of Blackpool FC. In 2015 fans attacked the directors' box of Blackpool's Bloomfield Road stadium with eggs, smoke bombs and fireworks, in protest at Karl Oyston's stewardship of the club. Mr Belekon won a court case against the Oystons in Manchester earlier this year. The dispute concerned a share of profits following a £4.7m contribution to the development of the club's stadium. Mr Belekone was suspended from the board of the club in March, after a judgement by the Paris Court of Appeal regarding disputed allegations of money laundering in banks he started or owned."

In addition, just over one in five (22%) of the infants, and 13% of the older primary group believed that pasta comes from animals. Around one in 10 (11%) of 11-14-year-olds and a similar proportion of 14-16-year-olds (10%) thought that tomatoes grow underground. While 73% of five to seven-year-olds and 92% of eight to 11-year-olds knew that fish fingers are usually made from haddock or cod, 18% of the younger pupils thought they were made of chicken, along with 6% of the older group. Some 11% of both 11-14-year-olds and 14-16-year-olds thought that fruit pastilles counted towards their five-a-day, while 27% of the younger group and 26% of the older range thought that they could include strawberry jam as part of their daily fruit and veg. The findings did however show that 31% of 11-14-year-olds and 28% of 14-16-year-olds say that they know lots about healthy eating and try to follow it, while almost half of the younger group and 48% of the older children say they know lots but either do not follow it or do not always follow it. The survey by the British Nutrition Foundation for its Healthy Eating Week questioned 5,040 UK children between 24 April and 12 May. Roy Ballam, BNF managing director and head of education, said: ""Schools and families can and should successfully work together to, in turn, educate children and then motivate them in their endeavours to make healthier choices. ""Furthermore, the links between physical activity, health and diet should be frequently highlighted by the Government's programmes."""

He said he immediately clicked that it could be a terror attack. ""We ran down to the yard and started getting the team back in the vans,"" he said. ""It was like something out of a movie with police officers running everywhere. Everybody was jumping into cars, getting cars going."" The 41-year-old and his officers rushed to Borough High Street and made their way on foot to the market where the attackers were looking for people to kill. :: London attackers' fake suicide belts pictured ""We had some updates on the radio about at least three men attacking people with knives, but it wasn't really a clear situation and we were not really sure what to expect,"" he said. Inspector Cole said he saw walking wounded and people lying on the floor with cuts and stab injuries. ""I asked my officers to form a cordon to stop the public from going into the market, and that's when the shooting started just behind us. ""We had no idea what was going on, we didn't know if it was us shooting or if the bad guys had guns."" Inspector Cole said people were running out of the market screaming: ""I would described it as pandemonium really,"" said the officer. He also received warning over the radio that the attackers were wearing suicide vests. The married father-of-three set up a triage area in the Katzenjammers pub and shepherded members of the public into the basement. ""I spoke with the 200 frightened people and told them that there were armed officers outside, we were safe and we would evacuate them as soon as we could and I got a big round of applause. ""On my radio I could hear officers on London Bridge desperately calling for ambulances, they were doing CPR on people. ""I decided I had to get my medic up there to help, but I didn't know what the threat was to their safety. ""I managed to grab a couple of armed officers and they escorted my medic, and another police medic, up to London Bridge."" Inspector Cole said it was the worst thing he has seen. ""I've dealt with things over the years - people stabbed or murdered and death - but it was the sheer scale of it all,"" he said. A week after the attack, many people on Saturday paused by the sea of flowers as pubs metres away were busy again. People at The George said it was important to carry on as normal. A man who from Cardiff said: ""I just wanted to show solidarity. I'm a teacher, I'd discussed this with my year 6 pupils and I just wanted to show that all people across Great Britain are behind London and supporting peace, togetherness and solidarity."" Another said: ""They (the attackers) can't harm what London is. They can't do anything to change the fact that London is a great city. ""I'm not going to let someone with a crazy ideology change what I do on a Friday or Saturday night."" Many bars which took people in on the night of the attack re-opened on Sunday. Borough Market remains closed, but it is expected stalls will re-open in the coming days. The Dean of Southwark Cathedral, which is right at the centre of the attack scene, has told Sky News how he ran towards the mayhem hoping to open the cathedral to offer refuge - but he was turned back by police. ""I got as far as I could,"" he said, adding: ""Heavily armed police shoved me back and told me to 'run! run!'."" He went on: ""I was scared, terrified really. I have never experienced anything like that, I didn't think I would."" Meanwhile, it has emerged that Government guidance issued days after the attack warns hospitals and doctors surgeries that they too could be targeted by terrorists. The Crowded Places Guidance tells health providers: ""It is possible that your hospital or surgery for example could be the target of a terrorist incident... ""In the worst case scenario your staff, patients and visitors could be killed or injured, and your premises destroyed or damaged in a 'no warning', multiple and coordinated terrorist attack."""

Detective Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson confirmed 29 house searches have been conducted over the past three weeks - and evidence of explosive material has been found at several locations with links to Abedi. Officers are appealing for information about red and blue barrels which were stored in a Nissan Micra that Abedi had made ""repeated trips"" to before his attack. A search is also continuing at a landfill site for a blue suitcase which may contain ""crucial evidence"" that the 22-year-old discarded after assembling the bomb. Mr Jackson said: ""Our enquiries show that the assembly of the device is likely to have been by Abedi himself. What is less clear is whether he acted alone in obtaining the materials for the device...and whether others knew or were complicit in the storage of materials knowing what was being planned."" He also revealed that Abedi was identified within two hours of detonating the bomb in Manchester city centre which killed 22 people. Police now have a ""deep understanding"" of the terrorist's movements in the weeks leading up to the attack. Abedi had visited Libya on 15 April and returned on 18 May. Officers also know that he tried to send money out of the UK in the days leading up to the bombing. Mr Jackson added that British police want to interview Hasham Abedi, the attacker's brother, who is currently being detained in Libya. Some 22 people have been arrested in connection with the bombing, but all of them have been released without charge. The bomb - which was packed with a ""massive number"" of small metal objects to kill as many people as possible - claimed the lives of 22 people, and injured dozens of others. More than 1,000 officers have so far been involved in the ongoing investigation, with 8,000 entries on police logging system and at least 700 devices, such as phones, seized for examination."
2017-06-12,Security researchers have demonstrated how e-cigarettes can easily be modified into tools to hack computers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612174738/http://news.sky.com/story/e-cigarettes-can-be-used-to-hack-computers-10908333,"With only minor modifications, the vape pen can be used by attackers to compromise the computers they are connected to - even if it seems just like they are charging. Giving a presentation at BSides London, Ross Bevington showed how an e-cigarette could be used to attack a computer by fooling the computer to believe it was a keyboard or by tampering with its network traffic. While Mr Bevington's particular form of attack required the victim's machine to be unlocked, that was not the case for all attacks. ""PoisonTap is a very similar style of attack that will even work on locked machines,"" Mr Bevington told Sky News. Another hacker and researcher known as Fouroctets published a proof-of-concept video which showed arbitrary commands being entered into his unlocked laptop just after plugging in a vape pen to charge. Speaking to Sky News, Fouroctets said he had modified the vape pen by simply adding a hardware chip which allowed the device to communicate with the laptop as if it were a keyboard or mouse. A pre-written script that was saved on the vape made Windows open up the Notepad application and typed ""Do you even vape bro!!!!"" The script could have been modified to do something much more malicious, however. Fouroctets showed Sky News how, using less than 20 lines of code, the computer could be made to download an arbitrary and potentially dangerous file and run it. While e-cigarettes could be used to deliver malicious payloads to machines, there is usually very little space available on them to host this code. ""This puts limitations on how elaborate a real attack could be made,"" said Mr Bevington. ""The WannaCry malware for instance was 4-5MB, hundreds of times larger than the space on an e-cigarette. That being said, using something like an e-cigarette to download something larger from the Internet would be possible."" The best way to protect against these kind of attacks is to ensure that your machine has updated its security patches, said Mr Bevington, and to ""have a good password and lock your machine when you leave it"". ""If you run a business you should invest in some kind of monitoring solution that can alerted your security team when something like this attack occurs,"" he said. ""In all cases, be wary if someone wants to plug something into your machine."""
2017-06-12,It's one of the biggest and most important jobs in corporate America.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612174738/http://news.sky.com/story/general-electric-long-time-ceo-jeff-immelt-is-stepping-down-10913510,"General Electric has named John Flannery, head of its healthcare division, as its new chairman and chief executive. He succeeds Jeff Immelt, who has notched up 16 years in the role, a thoroughly impressive stint and in no way diminished by the fact this Mr Immelt's predecessor, Jack Welch, managed 20 years in the job. Despite being somewhat eclipsed in size during the last decade or so by tech titans like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook, GE is still America's 11th biggest company by market capitalisation, with a value of $243bn. It employs 333,000 people globally, including 22,000 in the UK, where it generates annual sales of $5bn and reckons to be the country's third largest industrial business. GE boasts a stupendous history. Its origins date back to the launch of the machine-moulded electric light bulb in 1892 by Thomas Edison, America's greatest-ever inventor, while it is the only one of the dozen founding members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896 that is still in the index. Over the years, it has been a pioneer in x-rays, television sets, turbines and, using technology developed by Britain's Sir Frank Whittle, it built America's first jet engines. Its activities these days sprawl across power generation, aviation, lighting, healthcare, digital and financial services. In other words, this is a big beast of the corporate world, making the appointment of a new boss absolutely critical. By plumping for Mr Flannery, 55, GE is adopting the same tactic - in hiring from within - that it did when Mr Immelt, 61, was appointed. Mr Immelt had been with GE for 19 years at the time of his appointment; Mr Flannery has been at the company for 30 years, much of that at GE Capital, the financial services arm. Moreover, like Mr Immelt, Mr Flannery has most recently been running GE's healthcare division at the time of his appointment, although in Mr Immelt's day, it was known as GE Medical Systems. The challenges facing Mr Flannery, though, differ from those of his predecessor. When Mr Immelt became CEO, his biggest challenge was escaping the shadow of Mr Welch, a man under whom GE was regularly named ""the world's most admired company"" and who was described by The Economist, no less, as ""the Princess Diana of business"". During his two decades at the top, Mr Welch - nicknamed ""Neutron Jack"" for the way he could leave buildings intact while removing the employees in them - took GE's annual sales from $25bn to $111bn and its annual profits from $1.4bn to $11bn, while somehow managing to keep GE's unusual spread of businesses together at a time when its rivals were having to focus or break themselves up. Mr Welch was a brutal boss, firing the bottom 10% of GE's managers each year regardless of how well the company was performing as a whole, but he got results. GE increased its profits every quarter that he was in charge. When Mr Immelt took the helm, he was almost immediately forced to manage the business through the shocking aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, which not only cost the company's insurance division an estimated $600m but also battered demand for the company's jet engines. Subsequent shocks through which he had to navigate included the financial crisis. During his time in office, he has remodelled GE, selling its property and consumer finance divisions, the latter of which racked up huge losses during the financial crisis that almost capsized its parent. He also sold the broadcaster NBC Universal to Comcast, the cable operator, and GE's appliances business, which was offloaded to Electrolux of Sweden. Taking their place as having greater strategic value was healthcare, which was pumped up by the 2003 acquisition of British healthcare technology company Amersham for £5.7bn and energy, on which Mr Immelt spent getting on for $25bn in acquisitions. That latter bet, arguably, has yet to pay off amid the downturn in global energy prices. Getting the most out of that business will be one of Mr Flannery's key challenges. Another will be coming to an accommodation with Nelson Peltz, the feared corporate raider, who has taken a 1% stake in the business and has been agitating for change. Running GE is a well-paid activity. Mr Immelt took home $27m last year, down from $33m in 2015 and $37m in 2014. But simply running a business of the size and complexity of GE would challenge most executives. Wringing growth out of GE's disparate arms, stepping up the company's exposure to new technology and proving that its conglomerate model still has relevance in the 21st century will be tougher still."
2017-06-12,"Consumer spending slipped back annually for the first time in nearly four years last month as shoppers turned more cautious in the face of ""rising prices and stalling wages"", new figures reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612174738/http://news.sky.com/story/first-fall-in-consumer-spending-since-2013-10913261,"Spending fell by 0.8% year-on-year in May - the first annual fall since September 2013, according to Visa's consumer spending index. Last month's drop followed a 0.3% increase in April. Spending on clothing and footwear declined by 5.2% annually in May, and was down 4.1% on household goods. There was also a marginal decline of 0.6% in spending on food and drink. The fall was driven by a 5.3% fall in ""bricks and mortar"" spending on the high street, but online spending was up by 6.9% year-on-year. Kevin Jenkins, UK and Ireland managing director at Visa, said: ""Our index clearly shows that with rising prices and stalling wage growth, more of us are starting to feel the squeeze. ""Bricks and mortar retailers had a particularly challenging month, with sales dropping at the quickest level in over five years, at a time when warmer weather and the May bank holidays would usually drive shoppers on to the high street."" However, figures showed shoppers were spending more money on experiences than goods. Visa recorded a 3.3% increase on spending on hotels, bars and restaurants, plus a 2.2% rise in recreation and culture - although the data indicated a marked slowdown in these areas from 9.1% and 2.8% the previous month, respectively. Mr Jenkins said the softer rates suggested ""consumers were reining in their discretionary spending"". The tough times facing UK retailers come amid rising inflation, which climbed to 2.7% in April - its highest level for nearly four years - with the squeeze on household budgets intensifying at a time when wage growth is stuttering. In real terms - taking into account inflation - wages fell by 0.2% in the first three months of 2017, the first time there has been a decline for two-and-a-half years. Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the index, said: ""The outlook for consumer spending continues to look relatively bleak, with households facing faster increases in living costs and muted wage growth. ""The squeeze on household finances is likely to get worse as the Bank of England forecasts faster increases in consumer prices in the coming months. ""Combined with relatively low levels of consumer confidence, uncertainty around the outcome of Brexit and a slowdown in UK economic growth, it's likely we will continue to see weaker expenditure trends at least in the near-term."" The official retail figures for May - month-on-month and year-on-year - are expected later this week."
2017-06-12,The number of nurses from the European Union registering to work in the UK has fallen by 96% since the Brexit vote last year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612174738/http://news.sky.com/story/applications-from-eu-nurses-to-work-in-uk-down-96-since-brexit-vote-10913295,"Figures collated by the Nursing & Midwifery Council show that the number of new applicants from the EU fell from 1,304 in July last year to just 46 in April this year. The dramatic fall in applicants to work in the UK is likely to place more pressure on the NHS as it grapples with a recruitment crisis, and increase political pressure to secure a guarantee for NHS staff from Brexit negotiations. There are an estimated 57,000 EU nationals working for the NHS, around 20,000 of whom are nurses. International staff have helped fill NHS vacancies for several years as the UK has struggled to recruit, train and retain enough homegrown staff, with EU nationals providing the majority. The Health Foundation, which obtained the figures following a Freedom of Information request, said the fall in EU applicants could impact patient care, with an overall shortage of around 30,000 nurses. Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, said: ""The recruitment and retention of nurses is one of the biggest challenges facing health and social care, with a shortage of 30,000 nurses in England alone. ""The drop in EU nurses registering to work in the UK could not be more stark - just 46 registered to work in the UK in April. ""Without EU nurses it will be even harder for the NHS and other employers to find the staff they need to provide safe patient care. The findings should be a wake-up call to politicians and health service leaders. ""But the overall shortage of 30,000 nurses is not a shortage caused by the Brexit vote. The chronic shortage of nurses is the result of years of short-term planning and cuts to training places. ""A sustainable, long-term approach to workforce planning is desperately needed."" Labour shadow health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said the NHS should be a priority in Brexit negotiations, which begin next week. ""Theresa May's weak and unstable government has pushed NHS services to the brink and it is patients who will pay the price,"" he said. ""Our health service has always relied on the contribution of overseas workers yet these staff are being forced out by this Government's neglect and disregard,"" he said. ""The Tories are overseeing an unforgivable drain of talent out of our country because of their chaotic attitude to the Brexit negotiations. The truth is that Theresa May has tried to use NHS staff as bargaining chips in her negotiations with Brussels. ""The NHS should be a priority in the Brexit negotiations and the Government should immediately guarantee the rights of EU staff who are working here in our health and care service."" The Department of Health is preparing a response to the Health Foundation statement."

A quarter expect their migrant workforce to increase, roughly the same proportion are also expecting numbers to fall, while almost half of employers do not expect any change during the next 12 months. The Foundation said these expectations were ""unrealistic"" given that Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to cut immigration to the tens of thousands. It said lower migration, coupled with a higher minimum wage and a tightening jobs market, could put an end to the era of readily-available cheap labour that has characterised the UK labour market in recent years. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""As the fallout from last week's election rumbles on, the new government will need to be making fast preparations for Brexit negotiations that start in just seven days' time. ""But it's not just government that needs to step up preparation for Brexit. ""Many British firms are totally unprepared for this change, particularly when it comes to migration. Ministers have compounded this uncertainty by choosing not to answer questions over what a post-Brexit immigration regime might be. ""Whatever people's views on Brexit, the journey, not just the destination, matter hugely to growth, jobs and living standards. ""Now is the time for both firms and government to focus on how we navigate that journey and the changes to our labour market it brings."" Mrs May is sticking by her controversial pledge to reduce net migration to below 100,000, something that was last achieved in 1997. Britain's Brexit deal following its departure from the bloc is expected to include restrictions on free movement rules, although the precise arrangements are yet to be decided."

She is sat on the floor with her hands on her head as the police enter. Ms Brown can be heard telling police: ""It's attached to a chain through a wall and my neck's attached to the wall up here."" She was found after police searching the property of Todd Kohlhepp, 46, heard her screams. Ms Brown told police she and her boyfriend Charlie David Carver went to the property for a cleaning job.

His arrest is linked to the killing of Gareth Hutch, who is the nephew of notorious Irish criminal Gerry 'The Monk' Hutch. The 35-year-old was shot dead outside his home in May 2016 - just a few hundred yards from O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare. His murder was the latest killing in the ongoing Kinahan-Hutch gang feud, which has claimed the lives of 12 people since it started with the murder of Gary Hutch in Spain two years ago. Gary Hutch was also a nephew of Gerry Hutch, who is suspected of masterminding the two biggest armed robberies in the history of the Irish state. A 39-year-old woman, Regina Keogh, has been charged with that murder. Five months later, an audacious gun attack at Dublin's Regency Hotel during the weigh-in for a boxing match took place, in what is believed to have been a retaliation attack. One man was killed and two others injured after gunmen carrying AK-47 rifles burst into the hotel reception and opened fire. The man killed in the incident - David Byrne from the Crumlin area of Dublin - was an associate of the Kinahan family. The following month, a man in County Meath in the north of the city was killed in what was believed to be part of the ongoing turf war. The 55-year-old - who was a close friend of Gerry 'The Monk' Hutch - was shot while sitting in his car. In August 2016, Trevor O'Neill was shot while on a family holiday in Majorca in what was believed to be a case of mistaken identity. The Irish 40-year-old was shot in the back while outside a supermarket in the Costa de la Calma resort with his wife and three young children."
2017-06-12,"A council has been fined £100,000 by the data watchdog after its employees' personal information was compromised in a hacking attack.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612174738/http://news.sky.com/story/council-fined-163100000-for-not-preventing-heartbleed-cyberattack-10913333,"Taking advantage of a software flaw in Gloucester City Council's website, the attacker downloaded more than 30,000 emails from the council's mailboxes. These email messages contained financial and sensitive information about council staff, according to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The ICO, the UK's data regulator, said the hacker exploited the Heartbleed security bug - which had been widely reported on and patched months prior to the attack. Heartbleed was publicly disclosed in April 2014 and was described as ""catastrophic"" by a number of security researchers and led to warnings from government agencies around the world. The bug affected OpenSSL, a widely used implementation of a security protocol which users normally experience as a closed green padlock on their browsers indicating that their connection with a site is secure. The enormous number of services affected by the bug lead a Finnish researcher to coin the name Heartbleed, and register a website and design a logo to raise awareness, although this did not prevent the bug being used to attack websites including Mumsnet after it was made public. The data watchdog slammed the council for ""serious oversight"" during its IT outsourcing programme which left staff's emails open to the attack months after the bug had been disclosed and patched. Sally Anne Poole, the group enforcement manager at the ICO, said: ""This was a serious oversight on the part of Gloucester City Council. ""The attack happened when the organisation was outsourcing their IT systems. ""A lack of oversight of this outsourcing, along with inadequate security measures on sensitive emails, left them vulnerable to an attack."" The ICO's investigation found that the council did not have sufficient processes in place to ensure its systems had been updated while it changed its IT suppliers. It also claimed that an attacker contacted them following the breach claiming to be part of Anonymous, the hacking collective known for attacks on websites. The ICO told Sky News it could not be confident about this claim, however, as the attacker had never been identified and the emails have not been recovered. Ms Poole added: ""The council should have known that in the wrong hands, this type of sensitive information could cause substantial distress to staff. ""Businesses and organisations must understand they need to do everything they can to keep people's personal information safe and that includes being extra vigilant during periods of change or uncertainty."" Sky News has contacted Gloucester City Council for comment."
2017-06-12,Iran has started sending fruit and vegetables to Qatar after Gulf nations cut trade links with the emirate.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170612174738/http://news.sky.com/story/iran-flies-food-to-qatar-after-isolation-by-gulf-neighbours-10913235,"Iran's national carrier has already delivered 90 tons of food and flights will continue ""based on demand"". Three boats, carrying more than 350 tons of food, will also be leaving an Iranian port for Qatar, according to Tasnim news agency, quoting local officials. :: Analysis - UK fears Qatar blockade is hurting its people It was not clear whether the shipments were made as aid deliveries or as exports. The deliveries came nearly a week after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates began a blockade against Qatar, sparking an unprecedented diplomatic crisis. The Gulf states expelled Qatari nationals from their territory, cut trade links to the emirate and banned Qatar's national airline from their airspace. Egypt and Yemen followed in passing measures against Doha. The blockade was in retaliation for what the states claim is Qatari support for terrorist groups and close relations with Iran. Qatar denies the claims. It has hired John Ashcroft, the US Attorney General during the 9/11 attacks, to review its attempts to combat terrorism and terrorism funding. The peninsula, which is connected to Saudi Arabia, is heavily reliant on imports for food and before it was cut off from its neighbours brought in 80% of its supply from surrounding Gulf countries. The isolation measures have led to supermarket queues as citizens anticipated food shortages. Iran has opened up its airspace to around 100 new Qatari flights daily, upping its air traffic by 17% according to the official state news agency. Other states in the region have also stepped in. Kuwait, which is not joining in the blockade of Qatar, is pushing to adopt a mediating role in the rift. Turkey's parliament has also approved sending troops to be stationed in Qatar. The move to isolate Qatar followed a visit to Saudi Arabia by US President Donald Trump. Speaking in Washington on Friday, he told journalists that the ""nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level"". The US has, however, called on Gulf states to ""de-escalate"" the crisis. Saudi accuses Qatar of backing groups allied with Iran across the region, including Shiite militant groups in both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Saudi has also accused Qatar of supporting the Houthi rebels in Yemen, despite the fact that Doha is a member of a Saudi-led coalition bombing the group. The states involved in the blockade have released a list of 59 entities and individuals that they say are involved in ""terrorist"" activities. Qatar denies accusations that it provides financial support to groups like Islamic State and Al Qaeda, and defends its links with Iran and Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood."

The Queen is expected to attend Parliament a few days later to give the speech that reveals that year's legislative agenda. :: Live reaction to election fallout A Labour spokesperson responded: ""Number 10's failure to confirm the date of the Queen's Speech shows that this government is in chaos, as it struggles to agree a backroom deal with a party with abhorrent views on LGBT and women's rights."" Earlier, Brexit Secretary David Davis admitted that the Tories' election campaign ""went wrong"" and some manifesto pledges would be dropped or watered down. ""We'll have to look at the Queen's Speech and what we have to get through,"" he told Sky News. ""It has to be voted on in Parliament in a week's time; it's a matter of practicality. ""There may be things that we simply can't put in. That will happen. That will be going on as we speak. ""We will try to carry as much of the House with us as we can."" Mr Davis also suggested Theresa May could have to re-think her approach to Brexit after losing seats in the snap election, which she called in an attempt to strengthen her hand. ""80% of the public voted for parties that reflect, respect the decision last year,"" he said. ""Ones that wanted to reverse it or do something different got hammered. ""We don't want to leave the single market itself, it's the Europeans saying you can't lose free movements and keep it."" He added: ""The argument [of] 52-48% - We're trying to get a deal for the 100%."" Mr Davis' had previously said the General Election result would show whether the public ""accepted"" the Tories' vision of Brexit. He also dodged questions about a possible leadership challenge, as the poor results has increased speculation about Theresa May's future. Pressed on whether he wanted to replace her, Mr Davis said he was ""not interested in running for the leadership"", hailing Mrs May as ""a very good prime minister"". He did not respond to Sky News presenter Adam Boulton's suggestion: ""That's like saying Richard Hammond is a great driver."" The Conservatives have said they will deal with the pro-Brexit DUP to help them push laws through Parliament. The confidence and supply exchange will apply only to ""big issues"" like the economy and security, defence secretary Michael Fallon said."

He was caught by a group called The Hunted One after arranging to meet Jessie in Llanhilleth, near his home in south Wales. Newport Crown Court heard how he had sent an explicit image to the fake profile in her name, and had asked for the girl to ""dress sexy"" when she visited to ""tempt"" him. Judge Daniel Williams said: ""You were on the internet looking for young girls and looking for young girls to engage in sexual activity. ""You were well-versed in using chat sites and very adept at using language and emojis to keep what you believed to be young girls engaged in conversations with you."" The judge said Gifford had asked Jessie if she was looking for sex, adding: ""You said how your messaging could lead to you taking her virginity. ""You told her you would like her to be your secret lover."" The court also heard how Gifford had exchanged messages with Jodie, with the judge adding: ""Yours were often sexual in nature - you telling Jodie she was gorgeous, asking if she liked making love, asking specifically 'do you want sex, love?'"". Gifford had asked Jodie to send him nude photographs, and when told her camera was broken, he graphically described sexual intercourse and told her how to perform a sexual act. ""You carried on asking for what you referred to as a 'naughty photo',"" the judge added. Gifford, who had no previous convictions, was jailed for 18 months after a jury convicted him of two charges of attempting to incite a child under the age of 13 to engage in sexual activity - as well as attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming. Jeffrey Jones, who represented Gifford, said his client had ""very limited"" mobility after suffering a heart attack and a stroke. The court was told: ""He is very advanced in life. He is in a state of shock at the publicity of the matter and the loss of his good name. ""He utters that the last thing he wants to do is bother on the internet again."" Mr Jones added that Gifford has been ""ostracised"" from family and friends since being taken into custody last December."
2017-06-13,"A House of Commons landslide was in evidence today, but only for Speaker John Bercow, re-elected for the third time without objection amid fond tribute speeches from around the chamber. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170613182321/http://news.sky.com/story/strong-and-stable-were-a-long-way-from-that-10914735,"Aware of the irony Theresa May noted ""at least someone got a landslide"". Had the Conservatives achieved the result expected when the snap election was called then John Bercow may not have been returned to the Speaker's chair. Indeed, Philip Hammond would not be Chancellor, the reshuffle would have been a proper one and we would know the date of the Queen's Speech. Indeed, much about the first day back at the Commons was a continuation of what went before, but vastly different to what was expected. The Prime Minister acknowledged the diversity of the new intake, but it was the standing ovation for Jeremy Corbyn from his own MPs which stood out, as bemused Tories watched on. Nothing has changed, Mrs May might say of her position from the Government benches, but everything has. Mr Corbyn proceeded to make a humorous speech littered with digs about the PM's predicament. He said he hoped the PM agreed that democracy ""is a wondrous thing"" and can throw up unexpected results. He looked forward to the Queen's Speech when the ""coalition of chaos"" is ready, and that Labour was waiting in the wings to form a ""strong and stable"" government. But the ominous line was Mr Corbyn's quip that he looks forward to the new Parliament ""however short it might be"". This is a Labour Party still in election upsurge mode, noting polls showing it ahead by five or six points, and waiting for the chance of another election. This, alongside the appointment by Mrs May of the backbench Brexiteer-in-chief Steve Baker as a junior Brexit minister, suggests the calls for a more ""nuanced"" and ""pragmatic"" Brexit from within Cabinet will struggle amid a partisan parliamentary atmosphere. The hung parliament delivered by the election is a message from the electorate that parties need to work together. In a minority government, ministers would struggle to pass all but the most anodyne of legislation, but Brexit involves a multitude of different controversial legislation starting with the Great Repeal Bill. The House of Lords feels released from the Salisbury Convention, because the Conservative manifesto did not receive majority support. In these circumstances governing is the art of the possible. It is not really a matter of the Brexit that various politicians prefer, but the Brexit that could pass through the House of Commons. The words ""no deal"" have not been uttered since the election. It seems impossible to see this Parliament allowing the Government to crash out of the European Union without a deal. :: What does Arlene Foster want from May? Delivering Brexit will require some compromise. Many in Cabinet believe this. It seems to be a statement of basic parliamentary arithmetic. But it is also the area most likely to see the sort of Tory split that would bring down the Government. All the while, the negotiations are not dragging; rather, they have not started and 77 of the 730 days allowed for negotiation have already elapsed. Right now it is unclear when we will get a Queen's Speech, what will be in it, what mandate it will give to Brexit negotiators, how long the PM will be at the head of that negotiating team, how much cross-party support will be sought or given, and when actual negotiations will begin. As far from strong and stable as can be imagined. Negotiators expect this all to make the first couple of sessions ""more difficult"". The expectation of the Leader of the Opposition that this Parliament will be short, even before it starts, was a joke, but it is a signal of intent too."

Speaking exclusively to Sky News, Alexander Nix said that laws around data sharing would need to be changed, to keep up with current practice. He also said that the Conservatives had run an ""ill-prepared"" and ""absurd"" digital campaign. He said: ""A lot of the media that has been attacking us is liberalish, which means that they're pushing their own ideologies into print. Which is not very objective."" Over a series of articles, the Observer alleged that Cambridge Analytica had worked with the Leave.EU campaign during the Brexit referendum last year, but Leave.EU had failed to declare their contribution. Cambridge Analytica has taken legal action over those articles. Mr Nix told Sky News: ""We've really been quite consistent to explaining to your colleagues in the press over very many months that we didn't work for any of the campaigns that were involved in Brexit."" I asked Mr Nix about an article he wrote for Campaign magazine, in February 2015, in which he said CA had ""supercharged"" Leave.EU's social media outreach. ""Yeah, look, that was an example of the cart pulling the horse, unfortunately. ""That was a press release written by a slightly over zealous PR adviser that was put out ahead of any work commencing with Leave.EU. At the moment that came to our attention, we were very quick to clarify that it was an error."" An article on Leave.EU's website, dated November 2015 but since removed, said that they ""had hired the best people in the world"" and that Cambridge Analytica ""will be helping us map the British electorate and what they believe in"". Mr Nix dismissed the article. ""This doesn't say we worked with them. This document says that we might be working with them. And that was the case, we did have a number of discussions with them. ""We viewed different options with different campaigns about working on the referendum and we decided that we weren't going to work on it and we didn't work on it."" In February 2016, Andy Wigmore, the communications director of Leave.EU, told the Observer that Cambridge Analytica had been ""happy to help"" Leave.EU. Mr Nix told Sky News: ""I think you'd have to speak to Andy about that. But I understand that since that interview, he's changed his position and I believe there was some confusion about our company and another that he had been working with or talking about working with."" Mr Wigmore told Sky News: ""CA did zero paid work for us - it was a simple pitch process and set-up. If we won designation we would use them [CA]. It's that simple. We did not win so did not use them. ""It's true that we have strong relationships with many involved with CA and it's true we were involved with many other campaign organisations involved with the Trump campaign which is how we were initially introduced to CA."" Talking about the ICO investigation, Mr Nix told Sky News: ""They clearly feel that they need educating at this point. This is a very fast moving space and I think it's important that policy makers are up to speed with all the changes that are happening. ""I've no doubt that as technologies improve and data becomes increasingly available, that legislation will have to be adapted."""

The first move in Mrs May's new reality of compromise politics is to listen to what the DUP hope to gain by offering the Conservatives their support. :: Theresa May avoids leadership challenge - for now It is thought the Prime Minister is preparing to ditch unpopular policies such as her social care reforms and plans to means test the winter fuel allowance. Arlene Foster said her party wants to ""support the national interest"" and ""bring stability to the nation"". She told Sky News: ""We enter these talks in a positive fashion, we are first and foremost unionists and therefore we want to secure the union. ""But we do want to do so in the national interest to give stability to the Government and that's why we will be entering these negotiations."" Mrs May will also hold her second Cabinet meeting in two days. One senior Conservative source told Sky that ""a head of steam"" was building for a ""softer Brexit"", with ""significant people"" pushing, but said the PM is ""still unconvinced"". Tory MP Sarah Wollaston told Sky News: ""The reality of having a different arithmetic is that we are going to have a different kind of Brexit negotiation because at the end of it this will come back to Parliament, and Parliament will be voting on it, and that's the same for domestic legislation as well, there is going to have to be a much more consensual approach."" She added: ""What the public want to see now is rather than the parties using this as an excuse to constantly be sniping, what the public will judge all politicians on is how prepared are we to work together in the national interest."" Mrs May will later travel to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss online radicalisation. He and other EU leaders are no doubt keen to know where her problems have left the Brexit negotiations. Eurosceptic Conservative MP John Redwood said: ""We're going to make a great offer to Europe in terms of their access to us and continued presence of their citizens here in Britain - they are very welcome. ""So we are very, very positive, and I hope that Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition on this issue - when our Prime Minister is in Brussels arguing for the whole country - that they understand they said they wanted the same things and that's what she's trying to deliver."" Mrs May appears to have bought some time with her MPs in her meeting with them on Monday night - most emerged impressed with what she had to say."

He accused Owen and Karl Oyston, majority owner and chairman of the Lancashire club respectively, of adopting a ""deliberate strategy"" to take money out of the club, in a way that ""its nominated directors could do nothing to stop"". The payments system instituted in the management of the club, he alleged, was the ""antithesis of transparency"". Lawyers representing the club's president, Latvian millionaire Valeri Belokon, are pursuing a case against the Oystons for ""unfair prejudice"" against shareholders. The case is also against Blackpool FC Ltd itself and Blackpool FC (Properties) Ltd. The Oystons are vigorously denying the claims. The court heard that VB Football Assets, Mr Belekon's company and a minor shareholder in the club, was denied crucial information and a say in important decisions - as well as a share of profits. Speaking at the beginning of a five-week hearing, Mr Green said that Blackpool FC received an unprecedented influx of funds since entering the Premier League, including £48m in the 2010-11 season, followed by £58m after the club's relegation. ""Owen and Karl Oyston have treated Blackpool Football Club as the Oystons' personal cash machine,"" Mr Green told Mr Justice Marcus Smith, sitting in London. The case follows years of controversy surrounding the Oyston family's ownership of Blackpool FC. In 2015 fans attacked the directors' box of Blackpool's Bloomfield Road stadium with eggs, smoke bombs and fireworks, in protest at Karl Oyston's stewardship of the club. Mr Belekon won a court case against the Oystons in Manchester earlier this year. The dispute concerned a share of profits following a £4.7m contribution to the development of the club's stadium. Mr Belekone was suspended from the board of the club in March, after a judgement by the Paris Court of Appeal regarding disputed allegations of money laundering in banks he started or owned."

2017-06-13,An attempt by the controversial businessman who bought BHS for £1 to keep his investment vehicle afloat has been dealt a further blow with the appointment of insolvency professionals to wind up his company.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170613182321/http://news.sky.com/story/liquidators-appointed-to-wind-up-bhs-buyer-chappells-business-10914229,"Sky News has learnt that Milner Boardman and Duff & Phelps have been appointed as joint liquidators to Retail Acquisitions Limited (RAL), which was set up by the former bankrupt, Dominic Chappell. The joint appointment was approved by the Official Receiver on Monday, according to insiders. Mr Chappell, who took millions of pounds out of BHS during roughly 13 months of ownership, had fought to avoid RAL being wound up. BHS Group Limited, which is itself in administration, acted as the petitioning creditor, because it is owed about £6m by RAL. The appointment of joint liquidators from separate firms is not unusual, and was deemed necessary in the case of RAL to ensure a cost-effective conflict-free approach to recovering funds from Mr Chappell's vehicle. It marks another chapter in the sorry demise of BHS, once one of Britain's biggest high street retailers and which collapsed last year with the loss of approximately 11,000 jobs. Investigations led by Duff & Phelps and Milner Boardman, a Cheshire-based firm, will now focus on the complex web of transactions involving RAL both before and during its ownership of BHS. These include a loan secured against the home of Mr Chappell's parents, and a multimillion pound sum borrowed from Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group. Sir Philip, who owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to Mr Chappell, became the target of public and political ire last year when the chain collapsed with a huge pension deficit. The tycoon agreed a deal with The Pensions Regulator and Pension Protection Fund earlier this year to pay up to £363m towards a new pension scheme to safeguard most of the retirement incomes of around 20,000 BHS pensioners. Mr Chappell, meanwhile, continues to face a number of inquiries. The Government department which investigates bankrupt companies has launched legal action against him as part of its probe into the retailer's collapse. In April, the Insolvency Service took Mr Chappell to court for failing to provide information relevant to its inquiry. The Insolvency Service, which sits within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, can seek the disqualification of individuals as company directors, although it is not yet clear whether it intends to pursue Mr Chappell or others connected to BHS on that basis. ""Should our investigation find grounds for disqualification action against former directors we will be in a position to commence proceedings significantly earlier than April 2019,"" Sarah Albon, the Insolvency Service's chief executive, said earlier this year. A source close to Mr Chappell insisted in April that his documents relating to BHS had been seized by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs last November, meaning he was unable to answer many of the Insolvency Service's ""very detailed questions"". Mr Chappell declined to respond to a request for comment on Tuesday."

Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have been criticised for failing to remove unacceptable content. The two leaders plan to draw up new laws enabling them to be slapped with multimillion-pound fines. :: Analysis - Tension between May and Facebook over online extremism Mrs May's first foreign trip since losing her majority at the General Election will not be the triumphant outing on the world stage that Downing Street will have envisioned - and she is likely to face ongoing questions publicly and privately about what a hung parliament will mean for Brexit and her leadership. But ahead of the summit, Mrs May said the joint campaign would ""ensure that the internet cannot be used as a safe space for terrorists and criminals"". Last month, in the wake of the suicide bomb in Manchester, leaders of the G7 states - the US, UK, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy - agreed a package of measures to step up pressure on firms such as Google and Facebook to take down ""harmful"" content. Speaking ahead of her visit to Paris, the Prime Minister said: ""The counter-terrorism co-operation between British and French intelligence agencies is already strong, but President Macron and I agree that more should be done to tackle the terrorist threat online. ""In the UK we are already working with social media companies to halt the spread of extremist material and poisonous propaganda that is warping young minds. ""And today I can announce that the UK and France will work together to encourage corporations to do more and abide by their social responsibility to step up their efforts to remove harmful content from their networks, including exploring the possibility of creating a new legal liability for tech companies if they fail to remove unacceptable content. ""We are united in our total condemnation of terrorism and our commitment to stamp out this evil."" The governments of Britain and France will not just punish firms, but vow to lead joint work with the tech companies to develop tools to identify and remove harmful material automatically. Home Secretary Amber Rudd will meet her French counterpart in the coming weeks to develop the plans. A recent report by MPs said the companies were not doing enough to remove extremist content online which may be fuelling hate crimes. The Home Affairs Select Committee pointed out that in Germany, the justice ministry was drawing up plans to levy fines of up to €50m for firms which did not remove illegal content."

The successful test is ""a milestone in the field of engine research, which has been a bottleneck for China for quite a while"", according to Li Jie, a Beijing-based military expert, who spoke to state-owned paper the Global Times on Monday. It will increase the firing range and mobility for both air-to-air and anti-ship missiles used by China's stealth aircraft, including the J20 and J31 stealth fighters. A team from a research institute affiliated with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the state-owned contractor behind the Chinese space programme, made the announcement. They reported that two flight tests with the solid-fuel variable flow ramjet engine were completed in May. Solid fuel ramjet engines have the ability to burn oxygen from the atmosphere, rather than needing to carry their own oxygen supply. The hypersonic engines could potentially triple the range of existing missiles, allowing China's J20 and J31 stealth fighters to carry six of the weapons with the ability to hit targets nearly 200 miles away."

Sky's Ireland Correspondent David Blevins reports that DUP leader Arlene Foster is not returning to Belfast on Tuesday as planned, which could suggest a deal is not far away. One source close to the DUP talks said an agreement ""should be wrapped up within 24 hours"". :: LIVE - Parliament returns after election Following two hours of talks at Number 10, Ms Foster said: ""Discussions are going well with the Government and we hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful conclusion."" She added that ""Brexit, counter-terrorism and doing what's right for Northern Ireland in respect of economic matters"" were among the issues being discussed. The Prime Minister was not present as negotiations continued on Tuesday afternoon, as she had headed to Paris for a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron. Before her departure for France, Mrs May had addressed MPs in the Commons, calling on Parliament to ""come together in a spirit of national unity"". She made a self-depreciating joke after John Bercow was re-elected as the Speaker, quipping: ""At least someone got a landslide."" :: What does Arlene Foster want from May? The Prime Minister made no mention of the ongoing deliberations in the Commons, but Jeremy Corbyn did. Using Mrs May's election slogans against her, the Labour leader said: ""I'm sure we all look forward to welcoming the Queen's Speech just as soon as coalition of chaos has been negotiated. ""If that's not possible, the Labour Party stands ready to offer strong and stable leadership in the national interest."" Under the confidence and supply arrangement being mooted by the Tories and the DUP, the Northern Irish party's 10 MPs would lend its support to the Government for key votes - such as passing the Budget and the Queen's Speech. Sinn Fein has said the prospect of a deal between the Conservatives and the DUP is causing anxiety and fear, with the party warning it could have implications for power-sharing talks in Northern Ireland. Despite this, the party's seven MPs have stressed they will not be taking their seats in the Commons, and claimed doing so would be against the wishes of those who voted them into office. ""Westminster has brought us austerity, has brought us hardship, and it has hurt the working class people in our communities,"" one of their MPs told reporters at a news conference in London."

The killing was the result of a ""power struggle"" within a gang called the Tooting Boys, between the Elders and the Youngers, the Old Bailey heard. The court was told that 26-year-old Neel Croos died in hospital after the attack and a number of others were badly hurt. Prashad Sothalingam, nicknamed Bullet, has been found guilty of murder and wounding with intent after a retrial, having previously been convicted of violent disorder. The 26-year-old, from Edgehill Road, Mitcham, southwest London, was one of several young men from the Tamil community who had been at a birthday party on the fifth floor of a Morrison's car park in Mitcham when violence erupted. A jury heard how the two groups had known each other for some time and were part of the same gang - one faction being made up of older members and the other of younger members. Mr Croos was part of the older group. On 23 November 2015, the assailants ran from Morrison's along Majestic Way to the Sibthorpe Road car park about 300m away. A witness said that as they arrived in the car park someone shouted aggressively ""I am going to f*** you up"" and ""We run this"" as bottles were thrown. They then assaulted Mr Croos and his friends with weapons that included bottles, metal poles and snooker balls stuffed into socks, as well as the sword and an axe. Mr Croos was found with serious head injuries in the street and taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting, about two miles away in south London. A post-mortem examination three days later said the cause of death was a head injury caused by multiple blows with an axe. Mr Croos' friend managed to escape potentially fatal injuries by protecting his head with his hands. This resulted in his fingers being severed. They were reattached in hospital. Two other men were also injured. Sugan Selvarajan, 33, of Rawmarsh Hill, Rotherham, was cleared of murder but found guilty of wounding with intent and violent disorder. Sivakaran Ockersz, 19, of Heathdene Road, Wallington, and Visuparathan Dayaparan, 24, of Phipps Bridge Road, Mitcham, were convicted of violent disorder. Sothalingam, Ockersz, Selvarajan and Dayaparan had denied the charges. All were remanded in custody to be sentenced on Wednesday."

The Cyprus Mail reported a grenade had been thrown by a man on a motorbike. Police spokesperson Kristian Gray said investigations were ongoing and authorities are viewing the explosion as a criminal case. ""The building suffered no structural damage, just a broken window,"" he added. A source told the AFP news agency that the attack could be related to the involvement of the base's police in a crackdown on illegal bird trapping. It reported it came after bird trappers had been handed a ""heavy fine"" by a court. More than two million migratory birds are slaughtered each year on the island. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Defence told Sky News that Sovereign Base Areas Police were investigating an explosive incident which took place in the early hours of the morning at the Dhekelia base. ""At this stage the Police are treating this as a criminal investigation. Until the initial investigation has concluded we will not be in a position to make any further comment,"" they said. Cyprus became an independent republic, free from British colonial rule, in 1960, but the UK retains two bases which remain British sovereign territory and house military headquarters. The sites, at Dhekelia and Akrotiri, cover some 98 square miles of territory and allow the UK to conduct military and humanitarian missions from the eastern Mediterranean."

Shares fell 3%. The company also said a number of its UK theme parks - which include Legoland, Chessington, Alton Towers and Thorpe Park - had been ""adversely affected in recent weeks by the terror attacks and subsequent heightened security measures"". However, Merlin also said that visits by foreign tourists to its London sites had been boosted by the weakness of the pound - making their holidays to the UK cheaper. It said this had continued in the immediate aftermath to the Westminster attack. But the company was ""cautious on trends in foreign visitation over the coming months"" since the impact of the terror incidents would take time to filter through to holiday bookings. Merlin chief executive Nick Varney said: ""The impact of recent terror attacks on our London attractions is unclear at this stage. ""What is clear however is that London has bounced back before, and will do again. ""I have every confidence in the long term resilience and growth trajectory of the market. ""London is very much open for business, welcoming visitors from the UK and from around the world to this exciting and vibrant city."" Merlin, which operates more than 100 attractions around the world, earlier this year reported a 17% rise in annual profits, helped by the collapses in the pound after the Brexit vote. Its wider performance has been overshadowed over the last couple of years by the crash on its Smiler ride at Alton Towers in June 2015 that resulted in a number of serious injuries. Two teenagers - Vicky Balch, then 19, and Leah Washington, then 17 - needed leg amputations when the ride collided at 90mph with an empty carriage, 20ft above ground. Merlin was fined £5m over the incident last September."

2017-06-13,"The UK risks a cliff edge ""no deal"" withdrawal from the EU if it ""wastes"" more time before beginning its Brexit negotiations, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170613182321/http://news.sky.com/story/michel-barnier-warns-uk-it-faces-cliff-edge-no-deal-brexit-10913909,"Michel Barnier, whose department within the European Commission has spent months preparing for Brexit, said: ""I can't negotiate with myself. ""My preoccupation is that time is passing, it is passing quicker than anyone believes because the subjects we have to deal with are extraordinarily complex,"" he said in an interview with a select group of European newspapers including Britain's Financial Times. The interview is Mr Barnier's first since being appointed the European Union's point man on Brexit. Theresa May's disastrous election result has thrown the Brexit negotiations into question with no clear sense of when they will begin or what sort of Brexit and future relationship the UK is now seeking. Prior to the election, Mrs May had said that the UK would be leaving the single market and the customs union and she repeatedly insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". Since the election, her re-appointed Brexit Secretary David Davis, who told Sky News that the negotiation start date may have to be delayed, has said that the ""no deal better than bad deal"" slogan still stands but said that the government would listen to those calling for a softer Brexit. However in his interview, Mr Barnier sounded increasingly impatient with the UK saying: ""I don't know what hard Brexit or soft Brexit means. I read yesterday 'Open Brexit' too! Brexit is withdrawal from the EU - it's the UK's decision. We're implementing it."" The negotiation start date was due to be Monday or Tuesday this coming week but is now likely to be delayed because of the timing of the Queen's speech, itself delayed because of the Conservative Party's quest to reach a political deal domestically with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. ""Next week, it will be three months after the sending of the Article 50 letter,"" Mr Barnier said, referencing the UK's formal withdrawal notification letter. ""We haven't negotiated, we haven't progressed. Thus we must begin this negotiation. We are ready as soon as the UK itself is ready."" The UK's top civil servant on Brexit, Olly Robbins, was in Brussels on Monday for background talks with his EU counterparts. Along with Sir Tim Barrow, the British Ambassador to the EU, Mr Robbins held preliminary discussions about the impending negotiations with Michel Barnier. It is not known how fruitful the talks were, but sources close to Mr Barnier have told Sky News that the two sides have agreed to have further contact at later this week. As of yet, it is understood that no date for opening the formal negotiations has been agreed. Under the ""no deal, cliff edge"" withdrawal, the UK would leave the EU and implement World Trade Organisation rules which would mean tariffs on goods exported from the UK to the EU - which amount to 44% of UK outward trade. Cars, for example, would be subject to a 10% tariff, liquefied natural gas would be tariffed 4.1% and wheat products just under 13%. Across the board it could make UK manufactures less competitive than EU counterparts who sell the same products. Free trade deals with countries outside the EU would, to an extent, mitigate the EU tariffs but would take significant time to secure. In Strasbourg where members of the European Parliament are holding the monthly plenary, MEPs seem broadly frustrated and impatient by Britain's domestic politics and the delay they are causing. There is a common acceptance across the political spectrum, across the EU institutions and across European capitals that Brexit is now inevitable and a broad sense that it needs to be implemented to remove uncertainty on both sides. One key player on the EU side told Sky News: ""Everybody had thought: as of now we are on a rollercoaster with some crisis but at least the end point is a withdrawal treaty and uncertainty should evaporate over time. I think now we are in a longer period of uncertainty."" ""The name of the game is a withdrawal treaty with a deal because ultimately no deal is bad for us and it is catastrophic for the UK. No one is laughing."" the EU source told Sky News."

Mr Cooper had promised that, under him, the organisation would ""make friends and influence people"", admitting it had made mistakes in the past. Membership of the society has fallen below 20,000 amid claims it has persecuted farmers and launched ill-judged prosecutions, especially over fox-hunting and cruelty to pets. The charity, which has an annual income of £144m employs 1,500 people and prosecutes 700 people a year over animal welfare, is due to hold its annual meeting in two weeks. Mr Cooper's resignation follows a turbulent period under former chief executive Gavin Grant, a controversial figure who had threatened to ""name and shame"" farmers who culled badgers. Under Mr Grant's stewardship in 2012, the RSPCA launched an ultimately successful but highly expensive prosecution against Heythrop, former prime minister David Cameron's local fox hunt. The judge fined the hunt £6,800, but criticised the charity for spending a ""staggering"" £330,000 to bring the case. After Mr Grant stepped down in 2014, the charity spent two years without a chief executive. Last year, MPs demanded it stop routinely prosecuting animal owners for cruelty, following its failed prosecution of a family for alleged cruelty to its cat. Mr Cooper told the Times: ""Sometimes it's just time to move on and try something new."" The RSPCA said: ""It is with regret that we announce that Jeremy has decided to move on to pursue other business opportunities. ""Jeremy has been an asset to the team and has contributed to the continued success of the RSPCA."""

The DUP leader has summarised her position as ""strengthening the union"" - a message to her own Unionist constituency; and ""stabilising the Government"" - a message to the Tories. But given her new-found influence at Westminster, it is safe to assume that money for Northern Ireland is what will make the new political world go round. They will certainly demand capital investment - cash for infrastructure, hospitals and schools back home. Mrs Foster, a former Stormont enterprise and investment minister, has long sought a lower rate of corporation tax to compete with the Irish Republic. On Brexit, the DUP will want assurances from the Prime Minister that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Until now, one of the possible alternatives was an internal border at UK ports and airports. But Arlene Foster's DUP will ""never, never, never"" be prepared to show their passports on arrival at Heathrow or Stranraer. Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom has never seemed more secure than it does right now. The Unionists want the triple lock on pensions retained and no limit on winter fuel benefit payments. On those issues, the DUP are stealing Labour clothes in their effort to keep Jeremy Corbyn out of Downing Street. The hard part will be striking a balance between shoring up a government at Westminster and restoring a devolved one at Stormont. Any demand for a statute of limitation on the prosecution of police officers and soldiers during the troubles would be toxic for Sinn Fein. The Democratic Unionists hold what can best be described as conservative evangelical views on gay marriage and abortion. The party has been heavily criticised for blocking same-sex marriage, despite the Northern Ireland Assembly voting in favour of it. But those social issues won't be on the table in Number 10 - they have already been devolved to Stormont. Theresa May needs Arlene Foster more than the DUP leader needs her so she won't be bounced into any deal. The self-confessed ""bloody difficult woman"" in Downing Street might just find she has met her match."
2017-06-13,"Inflation climbed to a near four-year high of 2.9% in May, up from 2.7% the month before, according to official figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170613182321/http://news.sky.com/story/inflation-climbs-to-near-four-year-high-at-29-ons-10914089,"The higher than expected increase in the cost of living adds to the squeeze on households with wages climbing at a much weaker 2.1%, according to most recent data. Inflation has been accelerating largely thanks to the collapse in the pound following the Brexit vote, which makes imported goods more expensive. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the main upward pressure in May came from ""recreational and cultural"" goods and services, particularly games, toys and hobbies, as well as package holidays. Holidays are becoming more expensive for UK tourists travelling abroad because of the weak pound. Increased food and electricity prices - following hikes by major energy suppliers - also made a contribution - as did children's clothing. Falls in motor fuel and air and sea fares had a downward effect, the ONS added. The increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation left it at its highest level since June 2013. It has not been higher since April 2012. Economists had expected CPI inflation to remain at 2.7% in May. Inflation in four key categories - food and non-alcoholic beverages, clothing and footwear, furniture and household goods, and recreation and culture - was at its highest since 2013 or earlier. Wages are already falling in real terms - that is, when accounting for inflation - and official statistics published on Wednesday are expected to show this has continued. Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned last month that this year would see a ""more challenging time for British households"". Credit card firm Visa said on Monday that it saw the first annual spending by consumers in nearly four years in May. Inflation has been rising sharply in recent months having been hovering at close to zero until early in 2016. In May last year it stood at just 0.3%. Earlier this year, the Bank forecast that CPI would reach 2.8% by the end of the year but the latest figures show it has already exceeded that. But despite the sharp uptick in inflation, it is expected to leave interest rates on hold at 0.25% later this week - with some experts speculating that increased political uncertainty after the election would add to caution about any hike. Other data released by the ONS on Tuesday suggested inflationary pressures further down the track might be easing - with prices paid by factories up by 11.6% year-on-year, down from 15.6% in April. The Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, said: ""Rising inflation means Britain is set for a longer, deeper pay squeeze."" But Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said inflation was ""now not far away from its peak"" and was likely to edge above 3% before falling again. Meanwhile separate figures showed house prices also on the up, increasing 5.6% in the year to April - up from 4.5% in the year to March."

Chris Gard and Connie Yates, who are in their 30s and from Bedfont in West London, asked judges at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to examine the case after exhausting all legal avenues in the UK. Charlie was born on 4 August last year with a form of mitochondrial disease, which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where Charlie is being cared for, have said the therapy in the US is experimental and will not help him, arguing that life support treatment should be stopped. In April, High Court judge Mr Justice Francis ruled in the doctors' favour, concluding that Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. That ruling was upheld by three Court of Appeal judges last month, while three Supreme Court justices dismissed a further challenge by Charlie's parents on Thursday. :: Our parental rights were 'stripped away', terminally ill baby's mum says The ECHR judges' ruling allows Mr Gard and Ms Yates' lawyers time to submit detailed legal arguments. A European Court spokeswoman said ""Charlie Gard's parents filed a request for an urgent interim measure"". ""The applicants have not at this stage submitted a full, substantive application,"" she added The couple's lawyers argue that parents should be free to decide their children's treatment unless there is a risk of significant harm from what is being proposed. Medical law expert Professor Penney Lewis said that under English law, the ""paramount consideration"" was what was in ""the child's best interest"". ""So it's not really about the child's rights versus the parents' rights,"" she added. Nevertheless, she said ""the parents have rights to be involved in the discussion, to give their view, to have the case decided by a court, rather than by doctors"". A hospital spokesperson said: ""Great Ormond Street Hospital notes the decision of the European Court of Human Rights and continues to provide the highest possible standard of care to Charlie Gard, working closely with his parents."" After the ECHR made its ruling, Twitter account @FightForCharlie tweeted: ""Father's Day will be extra special this year as Chris will get to spend it with the apple of his eye Charlie!!"""

Very nearly four years later, and it's gone back there. A figure of 2.9% was higher than most had predicted. In fact, just about everyone seemed to think it would hold steady at last month's mark of 2.7%, but instead inflation carried on rising. :: Inflation up to near four-year high of 2.9% Toys, games, chocolate and holidays all pushed it up - a cocktail of fun, frippery and treats that's now starting to look like something altogether more troubling. Inflation is not a problem in itself. Most people accept that economies need a bit of inflation, to keep us spending, to allow wages to grow and to encourage growth. Certainly successive UK governments have gone along with this, deciding that one of the core tasks of the Bank of England should be to target inflation of 2%. It is a Goldilocks aspiration - inflation that is neither too hot, nor too cold. The problem is that, right now, it looks a bit too hot. When inflation outstrips wage growth, that means that we feel a bit poorer. We don't get the latest data about wages until Wednesday, but it's almost inconceivable that wage growth has gone up by anything like as much as inflation. Last time round, figures showed wages were already lagging behind - this time, the gap will probably be at least as wide. So we're being squeezed, which carries implications for the economy and also for the complex political landscape that we're presently facing. Put simply, governments rarely prosper at times when real wages are being squeezed - many of us tend to feel poorer, and a bit more unhappy. And at times like that, history suggests that voters often turn against the incumbent government. So what to do? Well, the textbook solution to rising inflation is to increase interest rates. That way, we're tempted to save a bit more, spend a bit less, and that brings down inflation. The problem with that logic is that the Bank of England's job isn't just to manage inflation, but also to take a view about the whole national economy. It worries about slowing growth, and, ever since the Brexit referendum, it's been apparent that the Bank has no intention of raising rates unless it absolutely has to. And we're not at that point now. The Bank predicted that inflation would peak at 2.8% later this year. Well, that prediction now needs a rethink, with plenty of City economists now tipping it to go just beyond 3%, but the idea that we're near a peak has plenty of support. Much of the inflation that's in the system is a result of just one thing - the sharp fall in the value of the pound that followed the referendum, causing import costs to rise steeply. Inflation only looks back a year, though, so once we go past the anniversary of the referendum, the immediate after-effects will start to gradually disappear out of the equation. So will we see inflation falling? Most economists predict exactly that, but they are a little cautious. Consumer spending has propped up the UK economy for a long time, and now we're seeing that slowing. Yet at the same time, we're still spending huge amounts on credit cars, and saving comparatively little. That, on the face of it, looks a dangerous combination. The most important element, of course, is Brexit - and what those negotiations deliver. Those talks will shape the future of our economy and, right now, nobody knows what they will deliver. These are uncertain times."
2017-06-13,"Crimes committed inside the grounds and immediately outside Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace have more than tripled in the past five years, according to figures seen by Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170613182321/http://news.sky.com/story/crimes-around-royal-palaces-triple-since-2011-10913941,"The statistics were released by The Metropolitan Police in response to a freedom of information request. The figures show that in 2011, 13 crimes took place within palace grounds and just outside, but by 2016 that number had jumped to 41 offences. When asked to clarify the types of crimes dealt with, Scotland Yard said: ""The vast majority of offences are lower-level crimes such as pickpocketing and criminal damage."" It added: ""The palaces have some of the heaviest footfall of all visitor attractions in the capital. ""Including the annual summer opening period, approximately 800,000 visitors and guests access Buckingham Palace alone. ""In 2016, a total of 41 offences were recorded for the two venues. Most of these were reported as taking place in and around Buckingham Palace. This amounts to approximately one crime per 20,000 visitors."" Sky News had requested a breakdown for each incident committed between 2011 and 2016, including the date and type of crime, details of any arrest, the outcome of the case and whether there was a conviction. The Metropolitan Police said it was unable to disclose all the information, give a breakdown of the types of crimes or detail of where they were carried out because ""it would allow interested parties to gain an upper hand and awareness of policing decisions used to safeguard national security"". Dai Davies, a former head of Royal Protection for the Metropolitan Police, who had responsibility for protecting the Royal family and their palaces said: ""The Met police have their own views on national security as I do. ""I think there's a balance in any kind of democracy. When we pay hundreds of millions of pounds in protection I think the public, and you and I, have a right to know how that money is spent."" In recent months Buckingham Palace has been a focus for increased security measures following the terrorist attacks in London and in Manchester. Roads around the palace are now closed to vehicles for every Changing of the Guard ceremony and there has been a visible increase in the number of uniformed police on duty. Just 36 hours after the Manchester attack a man was arrested near Buckingham Palace and charged with carrying an offensive weapon. The full breakdown of the numbers supplied by Scotland Yard show that in 2011 there were 13 crimes committed, in 2012 it went up to 25, in 2013 there was a further rise to 44, in 2014 there were 33 incidents, in 2015 that jumped up to 50 and in 2016 there were 41 crimes committed. In the statement the Metropolitan police added: ""Security and crime prevention at the Royal palaces is performed in partnership by the Met Police Service, Royal Household and the Home Office. ""We continue to work closely together to ensure that security at the Palaces is kept under continual review and tactical deployments made accordingly."" A palace spokesperson said they do not comment on security matters."
2017-06-13,"After such an unexpected election result, the Commons was in a giddy mood.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170613182321/http://news.sky.com/story/giddy-atmosphere-in-the-commons-after-election-may-not-last-10914720,"Conservative MPs appear to be in a more forgiving mood, however, after the Prime Minister's ""May-a-culpa"" at the 1922 Committee the previous evening. They cheered her loudly when she came into the chamber for the election of the Speaker, the first Commons business after any General Election. But the cheering and clapping was even louder - and lasted longer - for Jeremy Corbyn when he came into the chamber. What a difference a better-than-expected result can make! For the past two years, most Labour MPs have sat sullenly, silently and grim-faced during the Labour leader's often-plodding performances at Prime Minister's Questions and other big set-piece debates. On the Labour backbenches, the party's MPs were hugging colleagues who they feared would lose their seat in the election. There was a cheer for Tom Watson, Labour's deputy leader, when he came into the chamber. He gestured to them - not very convincingly - to stop. There were cheers too for Democratic Unionist Party leader Nigel Dodds when he came in. But no doubt some of those were ironic. Mr Dodds took his usual place a few rows back beyond the gangway. He and the nine other DUP MPs - the power brokers now - appeared to be present alongside him. At first John Bercow sat on the Conservative benches, a few rows back from the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, wearing a smart blue three-piece suit, bright pink and purple tie. He waved to his wife Sally, who has caused him some embarrassment at times since he became Speaker in 2009. Wearing a vivid black and white dress with what looked like a floral pattern, she was in the VIP seats at the back of the chamber, at the opposite end to the Speaker's chair. On either side of her were the two Bercow children. As well as waving to them, their father blew them kisses. When Black Rod arrived to summon MPs to the Lords, Ken Clarke - the new Father of the House - led the way. Mr Clarke has been absent from the Commons since before the Budget in March, having a heart bypass operation. He barely campaigned during the election. In his victory address in his Rushcliffe constituency on Thursday night, he said he had never campaigned less in a General Election. But there is real warmth towards him in the Commons and he was cheered when he rose to speak. Mr Clarke is less florid in the face than before his illness and he has lost a bit of weight, but he's still not very mobile and rested his hand on the desk as he got in and out of the chair stiffly. Jeremy Corbyn referred to his former lifestyle in his speech after Mr Bercow's re-election, recalling seeing him eating a bacon sandwich washed down with a pint of strong lager in the Members' Tea Room during a break in a debate on healthy eating in which Mr Clarke was speaking for the Government. Since his heart bypass, I'm told, this legendary bon viveur has been told by doctors he must have no more than one glass of wine with dinner. No doubt he's also been ordered to cut down on or give up the cigars. Those Tory MPs who just a few months ago wanted to unseat Speaker Bercow are obviously so deflated by the election result that there wasn't a whisper of dissent when his re-election was put to the vote by Mr Clarke. Conservative MPs have bigger battles to fight now. And, I'm told, Mr Clarke is friendly with Mr Bercow and was planning to turn a deaf ear to any objections in any case. Mr Bercow, typically, didn't need much dragging to the chair, the tradition that dates back to the days when Commons speakers were executed. Seven times it has happened in the past, he reminded MPs, prompting shouts of ""More!"" and much laughter. He was dragged by Labour's Alison McGovern and pushed in the back by former Tory sports minister Helen Grant. (Those two will get called early in the Queen's Speech debate!) In his acceptance speech, Mr Bercow told MPs he was ""a tested Speaker"" for ""testing times"". In the past, he has said he would only do the job for nine years. Not any more. During the General Election campaign he told Sky News he intended to stay in the job for the whole of this Parliament, which in theory could run until 2022. Mr Corbyn, however, predicted in his speech congratulating Mr Bercow that this would be a short Parliament. He also mocked the Prime Minister's election campaign slogans, accusing Mrs May of plotting a ""coalition of chaos"" with the DUP and claiming Labour could provide ""strong and stable government"". The PM, displaying her new contrite, chastened post-election demeanour, had a good joke of her own. Congratulating Mr Bercow, she said: ""At least someone got a landslide!"" Almost 24 hours earlier, she had told Conservative MPs at the 1922 Committee: ""I got us into this mess and I'm going to get us out of it."" On the evidence of the first Commons sitting since the election, it won't be easy. The giddy mood won't last!"

Classmates said the 18-year-old student at Winstanley College was ""taken far too young"" after her body was found at Orrell Water Park in the early hours of Saturday morning. A post-mortem examination has concluded that Ellen had suffered multiple wounds to the neck. Greater Manchester Police has launched a murder investigation into her death. Her friend Katie Hatton wrote on Facebook: ""Absolutely heartbreaking that this horror had to happen to such a lovely and caring young girl, always smiling and making me laugh in psychology. ""You were taken far too young - my love and thoughts are with friends and family. R.I.P. Ellen."" Lisa Wasilewski wrote: ""Seriously saddened by the loss of the lovely Ellen Higginbottom. My thoughts are with her family right now. ""I will always remember you for your love of horses and your bubbly personality. You will be missed xxx."" Chloe Williams, who had posted a plea for information about Ellen in the hours after she went missing, said later: ""Never felt as sick and upset and heartbroken in my entire life."" Winstanley College released a statement saying the community was ""shocked and mourning the loss of a wonderful young woman"". It said it was helping affected students ""come to terms with something no one should ever have to come to terms with"", adding: ""Please be kind to each other and take care."" The headteacher of nearby Lathom High School, Jane Galbraith, tweeted: ""All of us @LathomHS are thinking of you all at this terrible time."" Ellen was reported missing by her family at 7.20pm on Friday evening when she failed to return home from college. They said her disappearance was very out of character. Friends said she was last seen near Orrell Water Park, where there are two reservoirs surrounded by woodland. Just over six hours after the student was reporting missing, police found her body there. DS Howard Millington, from Greater Manchester Police's Major Incident Team, described the murder as a ""brutal attack"" and an ""absolute tragedy"". He said officers were investigating a report that two young women were followed by two men in the same area. Appealing for information, the superintendent said at a news conference: ""There are fishermen and youths who congregate in that area, so it's possible someone has seen something that isn't quite right. ""Myself and my team will not stop until we have found out exactly what happened and have brought whoever did this to justice."""
2017-06-18,Theresa May has scrapped the 2018 Queen's Speech to give the Government more time to push through controversial new Brexit laws.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170618161739/http://news.sky.com/story/queens-speech-scrapped-next-year-to-allow-more-time-to-tackle-brexit-laws-10918923,"The Prime Minister will on Wednesday launch a two-year parliamentary session rather than the traditional one-year session, in order to give MPs and peers more time to scrutinise Brexit legislation. But the decision is also a tacit admission of some of the parliamentary battles ahead: ditching the Queen's Speech for 2018 means the Government will avoid having to push through another vote on its legislative programme at the height of Brexit negotiations - and possibly tensions. The Queen's Speech - which sets the legislative programme for the government - is a big moment in the parliamentary calendar. But Mrs May was forced to postpone the official opening of parliament for two days - until 21 Wednesday - as she hammers out a formal deal with the DUP to prop up her minority government after falling nine seats short of the winning line in the 9 June snap election. The Queen's Speech was also dropped in 2011 under David Cameron's then-coalition government. Ministers at the time argued it was to give Parliament more time to scrutinise the Government's heavy legislative agenda, while Labour said it was an ""abuse of power"" designed to ease the passage of controversial legislation. Andrea Leadsom, Leader of the House of Commons, said Brexit would require ""substantial amounts of legislation"". ""We will build the broadest possible consensus for our Brexit plans and that means giving Parliament the maximum amount of time to scrutinise these bills by holding a two-year session of Parliament. It will mean we can work together to deliver a successful Brexit deal and a strong social legislative programme that delivers justice and opportunity for all."" The Government said the Queen's Speech will include the Great Repeal Bill, which converts EU laws into British legislation, and other Brexit legislation around immigration laws. Mrs May is also pledging to press on with a domestic programme to address inequalities in society, despite lacking a majority to push through any controversial reforms. No. 10 said the Government would deliver Brexit while also addressing deep-rooted inequalities in society."

The area is used by the Royal Armoured Corps for tanks and armoured units to carry out direct-fire live gunnery exercises. Two other soldiers are still being treated for their injuries and are in a serious condition, the Ministry of Defence said. Lieutenant Colonel Simon Ridgway, commanding officer of The Royal Tank Regiment, described the two men as ""exceptionally talented soldiers who loved what they did"". ""The regiment has lost two real characters and feels truly honoured to have served with them,"" he said. ""They will both be sorely missed."" Both were gunnery instructors and had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cpl Neilson was described as a ""real character"" who ""had the respect of those he worked with due to his professionalism, easy going nature and natural leadership style"". Cpl Hatfield was remembered as a keen rugby and cricket player who was an ""excellent role model and mentor"" who ""always put others before himself"". The Royal Tank Regiment, which is based in Tidworth, Wiltshire, and is the oldest tank unit in the world, said its investigations into their deaths were ongoing. The regiment's three squadrons are equipped with Challenger 2 battle tanks. According to its Facebook page, the Badger squadron had arrived in Castlemartin for annual firing period on 7 June. Paramedics attended the ranges shortly after 3.30pm on Wednesday, taking two men to hospital in Swansea, one to Cardiff and air-lifting a fourth for treatment in Birmingham.Five years ago, Mike Maguire, 21, died at Castlemartin when he was shot in the head while relaxing at a safe location just outside the training range. An inquest found Ranger Maguire, of the 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment, had been unlawfully killed."

The Queen and Prince Philip also observed a minute's silence before the Trooping the Colour parade in central London on Saturday. The Queen said in her statement: ""Today is traditionally a day of celebration. This year, however, it is difficult to escape a very sombre national mood. ""In recent months, the country has witnessed a succession of terrible tragedies. ""As a nation, we continue to reflect and pray for all those who have been directly affected by these events.

You're eye level with the three other famous chimneys; around you, the cavernous, hollow interior of the turbine hall and switch houses; below, three thousand builders on site, a hive of activity; and following the flow of Thames up to Vauxhall, a mess of crane-strewn sites, the biggest redevelopment project in Europe. I'm here to see the finishing touches put, by hand, to the chimney. One of the conditions for redeveloping the power station was keeping the power station. They were in bad shape, so they were laser scanned, demolished, then rebuilt - using the same technique as their original construction in the 1930s. That means hauling 6,000 wheelbarrows worth of concrete up the hoist, then pouring it into metal frames by hand. ""It's an absolutely massive, iconic project for the location,"" says Mike Grice, chief construction officer of Battersea Power Station. ""It's a driver for the whole of this regeneration of Nine Elms."" Nothing much was happening here before; the power station itself was decommissioned in 1975. Two years later, it featured on a Pink Floyd album cover. Now, thousands of homes are being built and businesses are moving in. The first premises open this summer. Apple will relocate its headquarters there once the whole site is complete. Good news? Not everyone thinks so. Writing in the London Review of Books, John Lanchester describes the Nine Elms area as ""a chaotic patchwork of architectural ambition, developers' greed and mostly well-meaning but always overmatched local councils"". Peter Rees, the former planner of the City of London, is even more forthright. Standing on the banks of the northern side of the river, he tells Sky News: ""London is currently covered by a rash of development that the politicians describe as being the creation of homes. I question whether that's the case. ""One of the most intense areas of that rash is behind me at Nine Elms. Immediately behind me you have St George's Tower, which is widely rumoured to be a home for Russian ill-gotten capital - a laundry you might say. ""And then more or less next to it we've got the American embassy, a fortified bunker for the US, still surrounded by some of its bubble wrap. ""And further up the river, Battersea Power Station being expensively restored, rebuilt - and it's a monument after all to a decade of pollution and Pink Floyd. ""Those three landmarks epitomise what's actually happening in London: it's not do to with the creation of homes. It's iconic buildings for property developers to maximise their development return, to maximise their profit. ""And in between them we've got these blocks of real estate which the politicians describe as homes but which are in fact simply investment ready - they're piles of safety deposit boxes."" The only corrective, in Mr Rees's view, is a massive collapse in house prices - something that brings its own risks. From 100 metres up, on the temporary platform surrounding the last chimney to be completed, what you see is a moment in time - a glimpse of London's future, yet to be decided."

Mr King, who is secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, also said ministers failed to insist that sprinkler systems be mandatory in new schools in England, despite clear recommendations in reports commissioned by the Government itself. Mr King told The Observer: ""They seem to need a disaster to change regulations, rather than evidence and experience. It was the same with the King's Cross fire and the Bradford City football club fire. ""They always seem to need a significant loss of life before things are changed."" The Prime Minister acknowledged the ""huge frustrations"" residents have experienced in trying to get answers from the council - and she vowed the public inquiry into the deadly blaze will be ""open and transparent"". Mrs May said the name of the judge who will head the inquiry will be announced in the next few days. The PM also confirmed that she will be responsible for implementing the inquiry's findings. The newly elected Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, says she has heard reports that some of the Grenfell victims have been sent outside the borough with just £10 a day to live on. In a letter to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, she said such cases must be ""addressed without delay"" if they are accurate. Mrs May said: ""I can confirm that a £5m emergency fund that I announced yesterday is now being distributed on the ground so people can buy clothes, food and other essentials. If more funding is required, it will be provided. ""Residents rightly want to know when new housing will be provided. I have fixed a deadline of three weeks for everybody affected to be found a home nearby."" Mrs May added that she has requested ""daily progress reports"" to ensure victims are re-homed quickly. London mayor Sadiq Khan has called for re-housing efforts to be ""speeded up"" and pressed Mrs May to make sure ""the recovery operation receives all resources and expertise they need"". He also wrote in The Observer about the future of such tower blocks, saying: ""Nowadays we would not dream of building towers to the standards of the 1970s but their inhabitants still have to live with that legacy. ""It may well be the defining outcome of this tragedy that the worst mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s are systematically torn down."" On Saturday afternoon, victims of the tower block fire - along with volunteers and community leaders - met with the Prime Minister at Downing Street for two-and-a-half hours. The Bishop of Kensington, Dr Graham Tomlin, attended the talks and said: ""There was passion, there was anger, but there was good, hard, reasoned argument used by the residents."" He believes residents left the meeting feeling ""reassured that they were listened to"", but added: ""Time will tell as to whether it makes a difference. We wait to see what action will come from it."" Residents are also understood to be meeting with lawyers on Sunday evening. There is also a minute's silence planned at 11am on Monday to remember the victims. Police now say 58 people who were in Grenfell Tower on the night of the blaze are missing and presumed dead, including 30 confirmed fatalities. That number may rise."

Mr Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for almost five years after seeking asylum as he feared he would be extradited to Sweden to answer allegations of sexual assault which he denied. He was also concerned that if he was taken to the Scandinavian country then he could be sent to the US to face trial over WikiLeaks' release of classified American government documents.

Met Office forecaster Charles Powell said: ""We have seen the hottest day of the year so far. ""Sunday and Monday will see repeat performances of Saturday, with a lot of England and Wales seeing dry, sunny, warm, humid weather with high UV, high pollen. ""The temperature though is creeping up a little bit day on day, so we will probably see 31C (87.8F) maybe 32C (89.6F) on Sunday, and maybe 33C (91.4F) on Monday, probably in similar sort of areas - southeast England, Greater London. ""All throughout this period we will have some pretty mild uncomfortable nights - a lot of places in the mid to high teens for night-time temperatures."" The building heat is forecast to keep temperatures in the south and southeast some 10C (50F) above the usual average for this time of year. Western Scotland, however, is experiencing its own weather front and saw only 13C (55.4F) on Saturday, compared with the highs of around 25C (77F) seen to the east. Public Health England has issued a heat health warning. Dr Thomas Waite from PHE said: ""For some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, the summer heat can bring real health risks. ""That's why we're urging everyone to keep an eye on those you know who may be at risk this summer. If you're able, ask if your friends, family or neighbours need any support."" Unusual levels of UV are also being recorded in the UK, with the strength of the UV in some spots being as high as that in Cyprus and Gibraltar. This has prompted warnings that people should take extra care in the sun."

He insisted the Government had acted on safety recommendations after an earlier fire in London in 2009, but it would wait for the public inquiry's findings before making any changes in regulation. The Chancellor's comments came as the political fallout from Britain's most deadly peacetime disaster showed no sign of letting up. :: LIVE: The latest updates after the Grenfell fire John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, criticised the Government's response and a Labour MP, David Lammy, raised fears of a cover-up as he urged the Prime Minister and Metropolitan Police to immediately seize all relevant documents. ""The response has been poor,"" says Shadow Chancellor @johnmcdonnellMP following the #GrenfellTower fire #Ridge pic.twitter.com/ya5DDtah36 The building's external cladding has come under intense scrutiny after the tragedy in which 58 people are presumed dead. It gave Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey mid-1970s structure, a more modern look but many experts have said it played a tragic role in spreading the fire so quickly, allowing flames to race up the building and making it harder to contain them in the crucial first hour. Mr Hammond, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, said: ""My understanding is the cladding in question, this flammable cladding which is banned in Europe and the US, is also banned here. ""So there are two separate questions. One, are our regulations correct, do they permit the right kind of materials and ban the wrong kind of materials? The second question is, were they correctly complied with? ""That will be a subject that the inquiry will look at. It will also be a subject that the criminal investigation will be looking at."" Mr Hammond also said the Government wants to see technical advice on whether tower blocks should be retrofitted with sprinklers before taking any action. :: Grenfell Tower fire: Faces of the missing Criticism of the Government has focused on an apparent lack of coordination on the ground and its failure to immediately find accommodation for dozens of families who lost their homes in the fire. Mr McDonnell said the Government had failed to immediately ""recognise the scale of this disaster"". Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he criticised what he called a ""catastrophic failure"" in its response. Jeremy Corbyn renewed his controversial call for empty homes in the area to be taken over by the Government to house victims of the fire. ""Occupy it, compulsory purchase it, requisition it - there's a lot of things you can do,"" the Labour leader told ITV's Peston on Sunday. Meanwhile, Mr Lammy called for action to prevent the destruction of evidence that could show criminal wrongdoing. ""The Prime Minister needs to act immediately to ensure that all evidence is protected so that everyone culpable for what happened at Grenfell Tower is held to account and feels the full force of the law,"" he said. ""When the truth comes out about this tragedy, we may find that there is blood on the hands of a number of organisations."" ""She's very personally affected by this disaster,"" Minister for London @GregHands says about Theresa May's response to #GrenfellTower #Ridge pic.twitter.com/010lTdBZU0 Tory officials have come to the defence of Theresa May, widely criticised for a perceived lack of empathy in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Mrs May met a group of survivors at Downing Street on Saturday afternoon, saying afterwards that the response in the hours immediately following the tragedy was ""not good enough"". She has promised a £5m support fund and more staff deployed across the area to assist the bereaved families. A clergyman who attended the meeting, the Rev Mark O'Donoghue, said the PM ""welled up"" upon hearing accounts of the tragedy from those affected.

The paper reported that the star's problems were triggered by failed knee surgery two years ago. McPartlin has an ongoing knee problem and is said to have started taking prescription drugs to ease the pain. A source said that alcohol had become a concern among his friends. Meanwhile, Donnelly wrote on Ant and Dec's official Twitter account: ""Thank you for all the kind messages and well wishes for the big fella. ""Your support is, as ever, much appreciated. DD xx.""

""One minute they say they've found the body, apparently she was found outside the building,"" says her stepson Alex Abdullah. ""How is that possible?"" He added: ""The other thing they said is that they've identified the body through fingerprints, which is possible, but it's not like she's been involved in any crimes or anything to give fingerprints.

2017-06-18,A renowned Spanish bullfighter has died after he tripped on his cloak and was fatally gored in a ring in France.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170618161739/http://news.sky.com/story/spanish-matador-gored-to-death-after-tripping-on-cloak-10918937,"Ivan Fandino, 36, who was a professional matador for 12 years, was performing at the Aire-sur-l'Adour bullfighting festival in the town of Mont de Marsan, near the Spanish border. The Basque fighter fell to the ground after tripping on a cape used in a turn to engage and distract the specially-bred fighting bull, and the animal plunged one of its horns into the matador's side, Spanish news agency EFE reported. Hospital authorities declined to comment but an independent medical source said that Fandino had suffered two heart attacks in an ambulance and died later in hospital. Fandino is the second Spanish bullfighter to die in the ring in the past year. Victor Barrio was killed after being gored by a bull in front of spectators last July, the first time since the early 1990s a professional matador had died in the ring in Spain. The centuries-old tradition of bullfighting remains popular in Spain, with around 1,800 shows a year before a total audience of some six million who view the sport as an art integral to Spanish culture. But authorities are under increasing pressure to clamp down on the sport on animal rights grounds. Activists renewed calls for a total ban after Barrio's death, saying the tradition is both cruel and anachronistic, while a year ago the regional government of Castilla y Leon banned the killing of bulls at town festivals."

On one side of the table are the DUP's Nigel Dodds, MP for Belfast North, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, MP for Lagan Valley. Among those representing the Tories are Damian Green MP and Gavin Williamson MP, Theresa May's Chief Whip. Damien Green, the First Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister, has been a Member of Parliament for 20 years. But when asked if he or Gavin Williamson knew anything about Northern Ireland, one source replied: ""They do now."" Nigel Dodds and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, on the other hand, know everything there is to know about political negotiation. Dodds, who is Mrs Foster's deputy and the party's Westminster leader, is a former barrister with a tough determination. In 1998, he survived an IRA murder bid. One of the officers in his close protection detail was shot and wounded in the attack. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP's chief whip, is Northern Ireland's longest-serving MP, having been first elected in 1997. Along with Mrs Foster, he walked out of the Ulster Unionist Party's negotiating team an hour before the Good Friday Agreement. They defected to the Democratic Unionists in protest over the early release of IRA inmates from the notorious Maze Prison. Two of Mr Donaldson's cousins had been murdered by the IRA while serving as police officers in Northern Ireland. Behind closed doors, the Tories are attempting to strike a deal with a highly experienced negotiating team. Three times in five days, Downing Street has reported, or at least hinted at, a deal that there is still no sign of. But the pressure on Mrs May increases with every day that passes without a rescheduling of the Queen's Speech. The Tories' best hope is that the loyal subjects of the DUP won't want to keep Her Majesty waiting too long."

He pointed to comments made by Chancellor Philip Hammond that Brexit meant the UK would definitely be leaving the single market and customs union. With the clock already ticking on the UK's two-year departure from the bloc, Brexit Secretary David Davis will meet the European Commission's chief negotiator Michel Barnier to hold their first formal Brexit talks on Monday. They come after Theresa May lost her Commons majority as she sought a clear mandate from voters to strengthen her hand for the negotiations. The election debacle has left her weakened and battling for her political survival. Mr McDonnell told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: ""I am afraid the problem with the Brexit talks is that we have a government in disarray."" Claiming Mrs May's administration was in a ""complete mess"", he argued it should make way for a Labour government that would give a ""clear direction"". Pressed over his own party's stance on Brexit, Mr McDonnell said: ""Once you leave the EU, formally you are outside the single market. ""But what we are trying to get is tariff free access to the single market."" He added: ""I don't care how we get it in terms of the structure as long as we get access to the single market tariff free and that means also we are not constrained by the existing rules of the single market and that's obviously freedom of movement. ""The structures become immaterial to achieve the objectives."" However, Mr Duncan Smith insisted there was support for the Government's approach, arguing Labour had ""almost exactly the same"" manifesto commitment on Brexit. He said: ""The key thing is we have a clear agenda. We are united in that and just need to get on with it."" Earlier, Mr Hammond told the BBC's Marr programme: ""We're leaving the EU and because we are leaving the EU, we will be leaving the single market and by the way, we will be leaving the customs union."" But he added: ""It's a statement of common sense that if we are going to radically change the way we work together, we need to get there via a slope, not a cliff edge."" He also warned failing to secure a Brexit deal would be ""very, very bad"" for Britain. Mr Hammond refused to say how long he believes the PM will remain in Number 10 as he criticised the way the general election campaign was run."

The election campaign has been a personal nightmare for him. Besides the party making only modest gains, from nine to 12 seats, he was besieged by questions about his Christian views. On election night, he only just scraped home in his own Lake District constituency, seeing a near-9,000 majority slump to under 800. He has probably jumped before he was pushed. He was likely to have faced a leadership challenge had he not resigned. Hours before his shock statement to his MPs, the party had already announced plans to elect a deputy leader. At the same time, Brian Paddick, the gay ex-police chief who was twice the party's candidate for London mayor, had quit as home affairs spokesman in protest at Mr Farron's views, in a move seen as the beginning of a coup against the leader. Since the General Election, the party also now has more leaders-in-waiting, in the ""re-treads"" Sir Vince Cable and Sir Ed Davey, than before. There's also Norman Lamb, whom Mr Farron defeated in 2015 after Nick Clegg resigned. But the early favourite with the bookies is Jo Swinson, who was a junior minister in the Coalition government. She lost her East Dunbartonshire seat in 2015 but has now won it back in this General Election. ""The early money has all been for Jo Swinson and we have already cut her price from 6/4 to evens,"" says William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams. Many of the party's activists blame Mr Farron for the Lib Dems' failure to do better in the election. They believe that but for the row over their leader's faith, they could have won more seats. For instance, Sir Simon Hughes had hopes of winning back his south London seat, Greg Mullholland lost his seat in Leeds and Sarah Olney failed to repeat her by-election triumph over Zac Goldsmith in Richmond Park. But the biggest casualty of the election for the Liberal Democrats was the former deputy prime minister and party leader Nick Clegg in another big-city seat with a high student population, in Sheffield. Throughout the General Election campaign, Mr Farron was quizzed about previous statements about homosexuality and abortion and his Commons voting record on both issues. Back in 2007, he told a magazine: ""Abortion is wrong. Society has to climb down from the position that says there is nothing objectionable about abortion before a certain time."" Then in 2015 he was asked in an interview if gay sex was also a sin and replied: ""We're all sinners"". He also insisted he would not ""spend my time talking theology"". But during this campaign, after repeated questions about his religious views, he said: ""I don't believe gay sex is a sin. ""I take the view that as a political leader, my job is not to pontificate on theological matters but this has become a talking point, an issue - and in that case, if people have got the wrong opinion of what I think of those issues, it's right to correct it."" Asked why his answer had changed, he said: ""I'm quite careful about how I talk about my faith. I don't bang on about it, but I don't make a secret of it either. ""When I get asked theological questions, which I don't think many other politicians do get asked, I took the view that it would be better for me to say this is a matter of theological nitpicking, and let's talk about the politics."" Then, asked about his previous evasiveness, he said: ""I didn't want to get into a series of questions unpicking the Bible."" Now he becomes the latest in a succession of Lib Dem ex-leaders. His record does not compare well with Charles Kennedy or Nick Clegg. And while he was once the darling of the activists, now he will be blamed for the party's poor showing in the General Election."

On Saturday evening Mrs May admitted that the response to the crisis had ""not been good enough"" and promised swift action. But Nadir said it was all too little too late. He told Sky News: ""I've looked at what she's said and read it all. ""I mean, it's too late to be honest, right now. ""Why wasn't this done in the beginning?

""The state of the tower is why the fire spread so quickly but I'm also angry at the reaction and how the situation was handled and what Theresa May has not done. ""Why has it taken until now for her to speak?"" On Friday, Nadir had tackled Mrs Leadsom over why sprinklers had not been fitted in Grenfell Tower during a recent £8.6m refurbishment. She had said: ""The ministers are looking carefully at all of the implications, whether there are quick wins that can be done, in which case they will be done, and of course the longer-term policies."" Nadir replied: ""Enough is enough. I've got friends in that tower, I've got a right to be angry."" The Prime Minister had come under attack for visiting the scene of the disaster on Thursday but not meeting survivors or residents. Her aides said the purpose of her visit was to get a briefing from emergency services. Later on Friday, she had visited victims of the fire who are being treated at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. On Saturday afternoon, Mrs May met victims, volunteers and community leaders at Downing Street for several hours."

We investigate criminal matters. The investigation will identify any criminal offence that has been committed. It will be wide ranging. ""It will go to establish the answers of what happened in the fire and how it spread, it will look at the building itself, it will look at the refurbishment as well.

Answering criticism that figures had not been released earlier, Mr Cundy said: ""I absolutely understand the frustration of why figures haven't been released earlier. The reason for that - at one point, in terms of our casualty bureau, there were 400 people who were reported missing from Grenfell Tower. ""Grenfell Tower itself is 120 flats.

The 13 men, two women and a child were released from the lorry by emergency teams. Two of the men were taken to hospital suffering from dehydration. Water and medical treatment were provided to the others. A 63-year-old man who was driving the lorry was arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration and is now in police custody. Police said it was vital they reacted quickly in getting the nationals out of the lorry as temperatures in the area soared to 25C. Sergeant William Keating-Jones, of Sussex Police, said: ""Our priority was for the welfare of the occupants who were in the back of the lorry. The vehicle was exceptionally hot and it was important we reacted quickly. ""This was a great multi-agency response to a potentially life-threatening situation, with emergency services, immigration officials, volunteers and even local residents all pulling together.

The PM had been widely criticised for her response in the aftermath of the tragedy. She failed to meet survivors during an initial visit to the site on Thursday, and was heckled when she returned a day later. :: LIVE: The latest updates after the Grenfell fire But a clergyman who was present at the No 10 meeting said Mrs May showed empathy as she talked for two and half hours to survivors. ""I saw the Prime Minister welling up,"" the Rev Mark O'Donoghue told Sky News. ""Somebody began to sob beside her and she just held her hand for the next 20 minutes, which wasn't quite the caricature most of us have of the Prime Minister,"" he added. ""There was real anger expressed at what the residents and survivors perceived as a lack of coordination on the ground, lack of communication and very little reassurance."" :: Husband searches for wife lost during Grenfell Tower escape Mrs May said after the meeting that the response in the hours immediately following the tragedy was ""not good enough"". She has promised a £5m support fund and more staff deployed across the area to assist the bereaved families. At least 58 people are missing and presumed dead in the blaze that broke out in the early hours of Wednesday, catching many families in their sleep. The tragedy in a social housing complex in Britain's wealthiest borough has become a symbol of inequality in the country, stoking tensions after seven years of Tory austerity. There has been mounting anger among demonstrators, with dozens storming Kensington and Chelsea town hall on Friday afternoon, many shouting ""we want an inquest"" and ""we want justice"". For the Prime Minister, it has added to her problems, following a failed election gamble and an increasingly weak grip on her party. Some commentators have likened her response to Grenfell to George W Bush's ""Katrina moment"", when the former US president initially surveyed the hurricane-devastated land from Air Force One. :: Grenfell Tower fire: Faces of the missing Grenfell residents said after the meeting at Downing Street that they had spoken to the PM about their demands and what they expected. The Bishop of Kensington, Dr Graham Tomlin, who also attended the talks, said ""strong words were said"". ""There was passion, there was anger, but there was good, hard, reasoned argument used by the residents."" He said residents left the meeting feeling ""reassured that they were listened to"", but added: ""Time will tell as to whether it makes a difference. We wait to see what action will come from it."" Residents are understood to be meeting lawyers on Sunday evening to consider The PM has ordered a public inquiry into the blaze, as the cladding used to insulate the tower block and the building's safety measures have come under scrutiny. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the cladding, which has been blamed for spreading the fire, is banned in Britain. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that a criminal investigation would examine whether building regulations had been breached when the block underwent refurbishment. The comments came as former chief fire officer Ronnie King told the Observer newspaper that urgent requests for meetings with ministers and action to tighten rules were stonewalled. A minute's silence is planned at 11am on Monday to remember the victims."
2017-06-18,Both Islamic State and Hamas have said they were to blame for the killing of an Israeli policewoman in Jerusalem.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170618161739/http://news.sky.com/story/hamas-and-is-both-say-they-killed-israeli-policewoman-10918384,"Staff Sergeant Major Hadas Malka was fatally stabbed as assailants launched two attacks simultaneously near Damascus Gate in the Old City on Friday. Police said two of the perpetrators opened fire and tried to stab a group of officers, while the 23-year-old policewoman was attacked nearby and died of her injuries. The trio were all shot dead at the scene. A second Israeli officer was wounded. If IS's claim of involvement was true, it would be its first direct action against Israel. A statement issued by its Amaq news agency said: ""Let the Jews expect the demise of their entity at the hands of the Caliphate soldiers."" It described the attack as ""revenge for God's religion and for the violated sanctities of Muslims"". But a senior Hamas official, and the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), said the attackers were their members. Hamas' Izzat El-Reshiq wrote on Twitter: ""The three hero martyrs who executed the Jerusalem operation have no connection to Daesh, they are affiliated with the PFLP and Hamas."" The PFLP said two of the attackers were its members in a separate statement: ""The media office of the PFLP armed wing mourns two of its hero comrades, two freed prisoners."" So far, however, police spokeswoman Luba Simri said the Israeli military had not found any connection between the three attackers and any armed group. ""It was a local cell,"" Ms Simri said. ""At this stage no indication has been found it was directed by terrorist organisations nor has any connection to any organisation been found."" Thirty-eight Israelis, two American tourists and a British student have been killed in shootings, car-rammings and stabbings since a wave of Palestinian street attacks began in October 2015. Many have taken place in the vicinity of Damascus Gate. At least 252 Palestinians and one Jordanian citizen have also been killed since the violence started. Of those, at least 170 were carrying out attacks, Israel says. Others have died during protests and clashes."

""We arrived on the scene within minutes after the accident, we found the assailant on the floor being restrained by around three people,"" he said. ""The injured and deceased brothers were being attended to and CPR was being administered on them. ""We found that a group of people quickly tried to collect around him and some tried to hit him, either kicks or punches. ""By God's grace we managed to surround him and protect him from any harm. We stopped all forms of attack and abuse towards him that were coming from every angle."" Imam Mohammed said he was with others trying to stave off violence against the perpetrator and he told police arriving on the scene that a ""mob"" was attempting to hurt him. ""If you don't take him, God forbid, he might be seriously hurt,"" he told officers. Footage from the scene shows an angry crowd restraining the suspect after he drove a white van into pedestrians - many believed to be worshippers leaving evening prayers - at around midnight. One person has died and eight have been taken to hospital following the terror attack. All of the casualties were Muslims, police say. People were filmed screaming expletives and ""killer"" repeatedly at the van driver as he was held down in the chaotic situation. Witnesses say Imam Mohammed urged people to leave the man alone, telling the crowd: ""Do not touch him!"" He was also said to have used his body to shield the suspected terrorist from angry onlookers. Adil Rana, 24, who was outside Finsbury Park Mosque when the attack happened, said the imam moved quickly to de-escalate the situation. ""The driver jumped out and then he was pinned down to the floor and people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he's done,"" he said. ""And then the imam of the mosque actually came out and said: 'Don't hit him, hand him over to the police, pin him down'."" Ibn Omar, a worshipper at the mosque, also saw the imam trying to stop people attacking the suspect. ""The assailant was on the floor, apprehended, some individuals were trying to injure him but obviously the general Muslims were saying that, 'no don't do that',"" he said. ""The imam as well was urging people that, 'listen wait til the authorities come and apprehend him'."" London mayor Sadiq Khan praised Imam Mohammed's actions. ""When things were getting very heated, and we can understand why, Imam Mohammed did a really good job in calming things down and making sure that justice can be done as it should be done via due process, rather than anyone taking the law into their own hands,"" he told Sky News. ""This is a good community. They pull together, they work closely with each other and the actions of Imam Mohammed are what I would expect from a good faith leader and a good Muslim leader."" Toufik Kacimi, chief executive of the Muslim Welfare House, also praised the actions of Imam Mohammed, calling him a ""hero"". The leader's ""bravery and courage helped calm the immediate situation after the incident and prevented further injuries and potential loss of life,"" he said. Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu thanked members of the public who restrained the driver, saying ""their restraint in the circumstances was commendable"". The driver has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder."
2017-06-19,A coalition of health service unions and the Prison Officers Association have called on Theresa May to scrap the pay cap for NHS workers or risk driving staff away.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170619163206/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-urged-to-scrap-the-public-sector-pay-cap-10920318,"In a letter to the Prime Minister, 14 healthcare unions and the POA urged Mrs May to use the Queen's Speech on Wednesday to end the 1% pay cap that has applied to public sector workers for seven years. The unions, including the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the cap has effectively cut pay by 14%, or £3,000 a year, for nursing staff since 2010. In a joint letter to Mrs May, they warned that pay restraint is preventing the NHS from recruiting enough people to fill tens of thousands of vacancies, and driving some staff away from the service. ""The Public Sector Pay Cap has forced professionals out of jobs they love,"" they wrote. ""Those who stay are overstretched and under pressure to do ever more with less.""The longstanding cap stands in the way of recruiting and retaining the best in health care. It is having a profound and detrimental effect on standards of care for people at a time when the NHS is short of staff across every discipline."" The letter comes after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said last week he would raise the pay cap issue with the Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond. Mr Hunt said of around 150,000 EU citizens working in health and social care: ""They are part of the NHS family. We want them. We need them."" His comments followed suggestions from other members of the Government, including Michael Gove, that austerity may be eased following the Conservative's loss of their Commons majority in the General Election. :: NHS Trusts ran up £791m deficit last year The commitment of NHS and other public sector staff subject to the pay cap has been emphasised by recent events, including the four terror attacks on London and Manchester, and the Grenfell Tower fire. Unions say the impact of the pay cap on the health service has been disastrous, contributing to a recruitment crisis across the service. At the NHS Confederation Conference last week, speakers and delegates from across the health service cited recruitment as the biggest challenge they face. The Government has also ended the £6,000 a-year bursary for student nurses, with some colleges reporting a decline in the number of students taking up training courses. The impact of Brexit also appears to have contributed, with a 96% decline in the number of nurses from the European Union registering to work in the UK since the vote to leave the European Union. The British Medical Association has called on the Government to prioritise the health service in negotiations with the EU, which begin today. It says almost half of the 10,000 qualified EU doctors and medical researchers in the UK are considering leaving in light of the Brexit vote, and argues they should be granted permanent residence in the UK. The BMA also calls for the immigration system to meet the demands of the health service, and for the Government to secure research programs currently funded by the EU. ""With the NHS at breaking point, the Government must keep the health service and its patients at the forefront during Brexit negotiations and control the impact that leaving the EU will have on health and social care across the UK,"" said BMA chairman Dr Mark Porter."

""The awful reality is, as I've said before, is that due to the intensity of the fire and the devastation within Grenfell Tower that we may not be able to identify everybody that died,"" he said. ""We have been from the top to the bottom of Grenfell Tower. ""The search operation will be painstaking and having been in there myself it's really hard to describe the devastation that the fire has caused."" Following his announcement, a minute's silence was held across Britain to remember the victims of the fire, which ripped through the 24-storey London tower last week. Mr Cundy said the death toll - which increased from 58 - could still change as investigations continue, but not as significantly as it has previously. ""I believe there may be people who were in Grenfell Tower that people may not know are missing and may not have realised they were in there on the night,"" he said. ""Equally, there may be people who thankfully managed to escape the fire and for whatever reason have not let their family and friends know that they are safe."" Mr Cundy said five people who were reported missing had now been found safe and well. The latest figures from NHS England show that 17 patients are now being treated in four London hospitals. Of these, nine remain in critical care. Mr Cundy said the search and recovery operation was still being carried out in the burnt-out tower. ""This is an incredible distressing time for families and they have my commitment that we will do this as quickly as we possibly can,"" he said.

2017-06-19,The moment is finally upon us. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170619163206/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-negotiations-begin-what-does-each-side-want-10919814,"Almost a year to the day since Britain voted to leave the European Union, the two sides finally sit down and begin their complex negotiations. The divorce procedure has begun. What does each side want? We know in considerable detail what the EU side is demanding out of the process. Complete with their long-established negotiating team, Taskforce 50, headed by Frenchman Michel Barnier, the EU side says its agenda and objectives are transparent and designed to remove uncertainty for citizens and limit the economic impact of Brexit. Mr Barnier, a former French government minister and two-time European commissioner, is an experienced negotiator and formidable operator. The EU's promotional video, distributed across EU countries, outlines their aims, objectives and red lines. The European Commission has published ""position papers"" on key issues to be resolved in the first phase of negotiations: #Brexit negotiations with the UK to begin tomorrow focussing on citizens' rights + financial settlement + new border https://t.co/2sCNL1rkEY pic.twitter.com/yhXZ7Eueis :: Citizens' Rights What is the status of the 1.2 million Brits living in the EU and the 3.2 million EU citizens living in the UK? Can they stay? What benefits can they have? Who'll pay? Which court protects them? Can they get permanent residence rights? Here's the EU's ""position paper"" on citizens' rights. In short it says EU citizens must be able to continue to live in Britain even if they arrived just before Brexit day, and that they must be allowed to apply for UK citizenship and all the benefits that come with it. Precisely the same arrangements should apply for Britons living in the EU. And one key demand: the European Court of Justice, the EU says, must have full jurisdiction over EU nationals in the UK for however long they live there. For the UK negotiators that will be perhaps impossible to accept. :: Britain's Financial Commitment (the so-called ""exit bill"") From the EU side, it's simple - ""pay up what you have committed to"". No figure has ever been officially issued but the net figure, which hasn't been denied by the EU, could be around about €60bn. Here's the EU's 'position paper' on the bill. It insists that the calculations used to reach a mutually accepted figure must be agreed upon. It also lists the 74 European Agencies which the UK has made financial obligations to - a hint of how complicated things will get. :: The Irish border Maintaining a soft border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is key to the EU negotiation position. The UK holds the same position; the question is how to achieve that given that the UK wants to leave the single market and customs union. Curiously, no EU position paper has been published on this yet, perhaps because it boils down to one single demand: the border must remain open. :: Britain's demands For its part, the UK issued its Brexit White Paper back at the beginning of the year. The 75 page document is, on the face of it, weighty. But it's been criticised by business leaders and the opposition parties for being light on detail. It does not spell out the practicalities of precisely how the UK plans to extract itself from the union. And in the months since it was published, the British Government has gone from having a healthy majority to no majority at all. Far from having a strong mandate, Mrs May's administration is now weak, fragile and propped up by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists. The White Paper said the UK would leave the single market and the customs union - a so-called ""hard Brexit"". But is that still the plan? It's not clear. Is ""no deal"" still ""better than a bad deal""? We've heard more talk about a ""softer Brexit"" and a ""sensible Brexit"" since the election, as well as suggestions of a cross-party Brexit negotiating team. For now, as things stand, the government says its Brexit plan hasn't changed. What plainly has changed, is its mandate to deliver it. :: What's the timetable? Today's meeting between Michel Barnier and his opposite number, David Davis, is essentially theatre - a ""grip and grin"" handshake and photo opportunity. It is an attempt by the British side to show that, despite domestic political difficulties following the election, it is ready and at the table in Brussels. There won't be a proper full-scale negotiation this week. In part, this is because Mrs May's deal with Northern Ireland's DUP, which would give her party a majority, has yet to be reached. The Queen's Speech, formally opening this session of Parliament, is also yet to happen. As things stand, the government doesn't actually have a parliamentary mandate for Brexit. But once the proper negotiations do get underway, they will follow a four-week pattern devised by the European Commission. Weeks one and two will be for preparations. Staff from both sides will meet in Brussels to establish the battle lines. The third week in each cycle will be the negotiation week. Mr Barnier and Mr Davis hammering it out across the negotiations table. Week four will be the time for progress to be reported back to the governments of all the EU member countries. This pattern will continue through the summer. Only when the EU deems sufficient progress has been made, will talks move to phase two - the future relationship. Accepting this timetable and sequencing was something Mr Davis said he would not do, but that was before the election. The EU side will be wondering if the UK has blinked even before the first round. The negotiations, including the exit deal and the agreement on the future relationship, must be completed within the two year period which began in March when the UK triggered Article 50. Brexit isn't a singular event but a long, tricky process and the timetable is extremely tight."

Burnt objects including baths, ovens, washing machines, and what looks to be an exercise bike, can be made out in the footage, filmed in one of the few rooms safe enough for specialist crews to access following the blaze. Another photograph shows two elevators blackened by smoke - with Commander Stuart Cundy warning: ""We must prepare people for the terrible reality that some people may not be identified due to the intensity of the fire."" Investigators now believe that the number of people missing and feared dead has risen beyond Saturday's estimate of 58. Commander Cundy added: ""Today, police teams continue their support to families, and make enquiries to cross check the number of those missing. ""I have always said I will be accurate about what I know, so the next figure of those presumed dead and missing will be released tomorrow, Monday, 19 June. ""The figure will be higher but I do not wish to speculate on that number today. ""I must consider the fact that there may be others in the building who, for whatever reason have not been reported to us. ""There is also a real possibility that there may be people in the building that no one knows are missing. ""I want to hear from anyone who believes that they know someone who may have been living, staying or visiting but has not yet been reported missing to us. ""We are not interested in your reasons for not telling us sooner, we just want to understand as best as we can who may still be inside the building."" He pledged to continue with the Met Police's ""wide ranging and exhaustive"" investigation into whether anyone is criminally responsible for the fire and repeated his appeal for material which may help the inquiry. The only victim to have been confirmed dead in the fire so far is 23-year-old Mohammad Alhajali, but Sky News has been told of several others. Family liaison officers have been deployed with 52 families, including those with critically ill relatives as well as those whose family members have died. The 58 who were estimated on Saturday to have died included the 30 who have been confirmed dead. Eighteen patients remain in hospital after the fire, including nine who are in critical care, NHS England has said. Earlier, the Government announced that all households left homeless as a result of the fire will receive £5,500, £500 of which will be in cash, from a £5m fund set aside on Friday. But the political row over the response of the Government, local authority and housing provider rumbled on. Residents who met Theresa May in Downing Street on Saturday said that while they welcomed the funds, they had not been consulted before the announcement was made. In a statement, the group said: ""At No 10 yesterday, the Prime Minister assured the group that from now on residents would be consulted on a coordinated relief effort. This has not happened with these funds."" Meanwhile, a group to help those affected by the fire, consisting of officials from several London councils, was set up to lead the ""recovery and response"". Families or individuals who need assistance were urged to go to the Westway Centre to make contact with the Grenfell Fire Response Team. On ITV's Peston on Sunday programme, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn renewed his controversial call for empty homes in the area to be taken over by the Government to house victims of the fire."

The ambulance service tweeted: ""Considering the drop, it is astonishing that the occupants weren't more seriously hurt."" The children were taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital for treatment.

2017-06-19,A professor at the London School of Economics (LSE) has been appointed to the Bank of England's monetary policy committee - currently split on the path for interest rates.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170619163206/http://news.sky.com/story/london-school-of-economics-professor-to-join-banks-mpc-10920268,"The Treasury announced on Monday that Silvana Tenreyro would replace Kristin Forbes, once her term on the panel ends on 30 June. The Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""I am delighted to appoint Professor Silvana Tenreyro as the new external member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England. ""I am confident that Professor Tenreyro will be a strong addition to the MPC, bringing a wealth of economic experience and academic rigour to the committee's deliberations."" Professor Tenreyro has taught macroeconomics and monetary economics at the LSE since 2004. She has previous central banking duties on her CV - having worked as an economist at the US Federal Reserve Bank of Boston while she was also an external member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of Mauritius. She joins the MPC at a fascinating time in UK monetary policy, given a surprise surge of support among external members for a rise in interest rates last week in a bid to help control rising inflation. Ms Forbes, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty - who backed a rate rise from 0.25% to 0.5% - were voted down by Bank employees on the panel including governor Mark Carney. Financial markets and economists will be watching carefully for clues to the rate path Professor Tenreyo may follow when she attends her first MPC meeting in August. The committee currently has only eight members as former Bank deputy governor Charlotte Hogg is yet to be replaced after she quit in the spring for failing to declare that her brother works for Barclays. Commenting on Professor Tenreyro's appointment, Mr Carney said: ""I am delighted to welcome Silvana Tenreyro to the MPC and am very much looking forward to working with her. ""Her extensive and varied academic experience - on the monetary transmission mechanism, the dynamics of productivity, trade, housing issues as well as wage dynamics, to name just a few - will be invaluable to the committee as it seeks to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom through maintaining monetary stability."""

He claims the company was among firms affected by a historic £245m loans scam by HBOS employees in Reading, who were jailed earlier this year. It emerged last month the TV star was seeking £50m compensation from Lloyds Banking Group, which rescued HBOS at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. The entertainer said: ""Until these criminals took me to the brink of emotional annihilation, I had always felt those who opt out by taking their own lives were selfish and cowardly. ""But having been cast into that bottomless dark space devoid of logic and reason, I have a much deeper understanding of life without hope. ""I seek no sympathy and feel no shame in admitting that on the evening of 18 January 2005 I attempted to end the overwhelming mental pain which had consumed my whole being. ""The fact that I did not become another suicide statistic is solely due to the swift response of a Devon ambulance crew and the compassionate support of the Priory in Bristol."" Lloyds said in April it would begin making compensation offers to fraud victims in May from a £100m pot, with payments expected to begin in June. However, Mr Edmonds has repeatedly urged Lloyds to speed up the process and says his demands for a meeting with the bank's chief executive and chairman have gone unanswered. A spokesman for the bank said : ""Our customers' safety is of paramount importance to us. ""We have a clear policy that if a customer says that they are considering taking their own life that we must take the statement seriously and take action to protect them. ""In such instances, police are notified and, where possible, provided with the customer's location in order that they can go to the customer and ensure their safety."" :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can also call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK."

Mr Davis and his team will hold meetings with their opposite numbers at the European Commission which is leading negotiations on behalf of the European Union member states. Speaking ahead of the talks, Mr Davis said: ""Today marks the start of negotiations that will shape the future of the European Union and the United Kingdom, and the lives of our citizens. ""We want both sides to emerge strong and prosperous, capable of projecting our shared European values, leading in the world, and demonstrating our resolve to protect the security of our citizens. ""I want to reiterate at the outset of these talks that the UK will remain a committed partner and ally of our friends across the Continent. And while there is a long road ahead, our destination is clear - a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU. A deal like no other in history."" The British team includes the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) Olly Robbins, Phillip Rycroft, the department's Second Permanent Secretary and Simon Case, the newly appointed Director-General of the UK-EU Partnership. Mr Case was Principle Private Secretary to the Prime Minister before talking up this role. Other officials around the table include Glyn Williams, Director-General at the Home Office, who will bring his expertise on immigration issues and Catherine Webb, a former treasury official, who is Director of Market Access at DExEU. This first meeting will last just a day with a joint news conference expected by both Mr Davis and his opposite number Michel Barnier at the end of the day. Sky News understands that the UK team has spent the weekend finalising their negotiating strategy which has been called into question following the unexpected election result. Theresa May had called for voters in the election to choose her 'strong and stable leadership' to ensure that the UK had a strong hand in the Brexit negotiations. However, the shock result and loss of a Conservative majority has reopened the debate over what sort of Brexit Britain wants. The EU's Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, spent the weekend mountain hiking near his home in the French Alps. In a tweet yesterday afternoon, he said: ""Back this weekend in my countryside, Savoie, to draw the strength and energy that the long hike requires..."" Retour ce week-end dans mon pays de #Savoie pour y puiser la force et l'énergie qu'exigent les grandes randonnées ... pic.twitter.com/c8lvUWlj4q Ever since the UK invoked Article 50 in March, triggering its formal intention to leave the EU, the European side has said it was ready to begin negotiations. However they were delayed to allow for the UK general election. Three key issues will dominate the first phase of the talks. They include the status and rights of EU citizens living in the UK and British citizens living in the EU, the financial commitments the EU expects Britain to pay as it leaves - the so-called 'exit bill', and the question over the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. When Britain leaves the EU, the Irish border will become the EU's only land frontier with the UK. If the UK opts for a Brexit in which it leaves the Single Market and the Customs Union, the Irish border would become a closed border unless negotiators can agree on creative solutions. Once agreement has been made in this phase of the talks, the second phase discussing the future trade relationship can begin. The EU side has said that this will only happen when 'sufficient progress' has been made on phase one and that they will determine the level of progress. On Sunday, the International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, flew to Washington DC on his first trade trip since the election. Dr Fox is meeting a congressional delegation on Capitol Hill in an attempt to pave the way for a UK/US Free Trade agreement. The UK is unable to sign such deals while it remains a member of the EU but can explore options and develop ties."

And she will have to deal with the fallout of the van attack near the Finsbury Park mosque, which she said is being treated ""as a potential terrorist attack"". In her in-box this week - a major speech on Wednesday at the start of the Queen's Speech, where she will set out her legislative programme for the next two years.MPs won't actually vote on it until June 28, but her benches will be watching her closely - every performance a test of her mettle after her faltering response to the Grenfell Tower disaster last week.There is also the matter of the DUP confidence-and-supply deal that still needs to be nailed down. No 10 are confident that the Unionists will vote with Mrs May, giving her an expected majority of around 13 - but she has yet to reach agreement.That deal is complicated by the wider politics of Northern Ireland, amid concerns that the deal with the DUP could hamper efforts to re-establish the stalled power-sharing executive at Stormont: to that end, the Prime Minister will on Monday meet the new Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Downing Street.""We will discuss Northern Ireland and the need to re-establish devolved Government, and Brexit, focusing on how we can avoid any adverse impact on the rights and freedoms of our citizens, on trade and the economy,"" Mr Varadkar said ahead of his bi-lateral. Then of course, is the start of Brexit talks, the Tories' fragile peace holding over the weekend after her chancellor confirmed that there would be no rowing back on the promise to leave the single market and customs union. But those tensions will no doubt rise once more when the tussles over Britain's EU exit bill and the future deal begin in earnest. :: Labour claims Brexit 'disarray' on eve of talks in BrusselsHer MPs are in no doubt of her shortcomings - revealed in full technicolour during the election campaign, and then again last week when she initially failed to meet survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. ""Everyone knows she's not Mrs Emotional in public,"" said one minister, adding that they thought she had the support of most of her party still.But the stories about whether it's time for Mrs May to go - and who might replace her - won't dissipate. There are suggestions that once leader contender David Davis might be put up as a caretaker Prime Minister, rather as Michael Howard was back in 2004. There's talk of a ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge if she waters down Brexit - though there is no sign so far that she intends to do that.Another senior party figure said allies of Boris Johnson were taking soundings from colleagues, which was playing quite badly with some MPs who are adamant that further Tory infighting would play badly with the public. ""She's the only show in town,"" said the MP. ""The public don't want to see us knifing each other.""Mr Johnson's team insist any suggestion he's on manoeuvres is ""completely false"". ""Boris is supporting the Prime Minister and anyone doing this sort of thing is not acting with his knowledge or support,"" they say.While some in the party believe the Prime Minister is now a busted flush, opinion seems to be coalescing around the view that now is not the right time to change leader. As Philip Hammond, the chancellor put it on Sunday: ""I think what the country needs now is a period of calm while we get on with the job in hand. ""We've got one very serious issues to address, including the Brexit negotiations just starting. Theresa is leading the Government and I think the Government needs to get on with its job. ""And do you know what? I think actually that's what most people in this country will think - that the Government just needs to get on with the day job of Government.""Getting on with the job has become her new mantra as grand designs give way to hand to mouth survival. How long she stays in No 10 depends on her party, but for most MPs her continued leadership remains the least worst option - for now."

On one side of the table are the DUP's Nigel Dodds, MP for Belfast North, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, MP for Lagan Valley. Among those representing the Tories are Damian Green MP and Gavin Williamson MP, Theresa May's Chief Whip. Damien Green, the First Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister, has been a Member of Parliament for 20 years. But when asked if he or Gavin Williamson knew anything about Northern Ireland, one source replied: ""They do now."" Nigel Dodds and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, on the other hand, know everything there is to know about political negotiation. Dodds, who is Mrs Foster's deputy and the party's Westminster leader, is a former barrister with a tough determination. In 1998, he survived an IRA murder bid. One of the officers in his close protection detail was shot and wounded in the attack. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP's chief whip, is Northern Ireland's longest-serving MP, having been first elected in 1997. Along with Mrs Foster, he walked out of the Ulster Unionist Party's negotiating team an hour before the Good Friday Agreement. They defected to the Democratic Unionists in protest over the early release of IRA inmates from the notorious Maze Prison. Two of Mr Donaldson's cousins had been murdered by the IRA while serving as police officers in Northern Ireland. Behind closed doors, the Tories are attempting to strike a deal with a highly experienced negotiating team. Three times in five days, Downing Street has reported, or at least hinted at, a deal that there is still no sign of. But the pressure on Mrs May increases with every day that passes without a rescheduling of the Queen's Speech. The Tories' best hope is that the loyal subjects of the DUP won't want to keep Her Majesty waiting too long."

He insisted the Government had acted on safety recommendations after an earlier fire in London in 2009, but it would wait for the public inquiry's findings before making any changes in regulation. The Chancellor's comments came as the political fallout from Britain's most deadly peacetime disaster showed no sign of letting up. :: LIVE: The latest updates after the Grenfell fire John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, criticised the Government's response and a Labour MP, David Lammy, raised fears of a cover-up as he urged the Prime Minister and Metropolitan Police to immediately seize all relevant documents. ""The response has been poor,"" says Shadow Chancellor @johnmcdonnellMP following the #GrenfellTower fire #Ridge pic.twitter.com/ya5DDtah36 The building's external cladding has come under intense scrutiny after the tragedy in which 58 people are presumed dead. It gave Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey mid-1970s structure, a more modern look but many experts have said it played a tragic role in spreading the fire so quickly, allowing flames to race up the building and making it harder to contain them in the crucial first hour. Mr Hammond, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, said: ""My understanding is the cladding in question, this flammable cladding which is banned in Europe and the US, is also banned here. ""So there are two separate questions. One, are our regulations correct, do they permit the right kind of materials and ban the wrong kind of materials? The second question is, were they correctly complied with? ""That will be a subject that the inquiry will look at. It will also be a subject that the criminal investigation will be looking at."" Mr Hammond also said the Government wants to see technical advice on whether tower blocks should be retrofitted with sprinklers before taking any action. :: Grenfell Tower fire: Faces of the missing Criticism of the Government has focused on an apparent lack of coordination on the ground and its failure to immediately find accommodation for dozens of families who lost their homes in the fire. Mr McDonnell said the Government had failed to immediately ""recognise the scale of this disaster"". Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he criticised what he called a ""catastrophic failure"" in its response. Jeremy Corbyn renewed his controversial call for empty homes in the area to be taken over by the Government to house victims of the fire. ""Occupy it, compulsory purchase it, requisition it - there's a lot of things you can do,"" the Labour leader told ITV's Peston on Sunday. Meanwhile, Mr Lammy called for action to prevent the destruction of evidence that could show criminal wrongdoing. ""The Prime Minister needs to act immediately to ensure that all evidence is protected so that everyone culpable for what happened at Grenfell Tower is held to account and feels the full force of the law,"" he said. ""When the truth comes out about this tragedy, we may find that there is blood on the hands of a number of organisations.""

She has promised a £5m support fund and more staff deployed across the area to assist the bereaved families.

""I want to thank my wife, family and closest friends for helping me through this really difficult time.

But the decision is also a tacit admission of some of the parliamentary battles ahead: ditching the Queen's Speech for 2018 means the Government will avoid having to push through another vote on its legislative programme at the height of Brexit negotiations - and possibly tensions. The Queen's Speech - which sets the legislative programme for the government - is a big moment in the parliamentary calendar. But Mrs May was forced to postpone the official opening of parliament for two days - until 21 Wednesday - as she hammers out a formal deal with the DUP to prop up her minority government after falling nine seats short of the winning line in the 9 June snap election. The Queen's Speech was also dropped in 2011 under David Cameron's then-coalition government. Ministers at the time argued it was to give Parliament more time to scrutinise the Government's heavy legislative agenda, while Labour said it was an ""abuse of power"" designed to ease the passage of controversial legislation. Andrea Leadsom, Leader of the House of Commons, said Brexit would require ""substantial amounts of legislation"". ""We will build the broadest possible consensus for our Brexit plans and that means giving Parliament the maximum amount of time to scrutinise these bills by holding a two-year session of Parliament. It will mean we can work together to deliver a successful Brexit deal and a strong social legislative programme that delivers justice and opportunity for all."" The Government said the Queen's Speech will include the Great Repeal Bill, which converts EU laws into British legislation, and other Brexit legislation around immigration laws. Mrs May is also pledging to press on with a domestic programme to address inequalities in society, despite lacking a majority to push through any controversial reforms. No. 10 said the Government would deliver Brexit while also addressing deep-rooted inequalities in society."

A witness, who wanted to be identified as Abdulrahman, said: ""I managed to get the driver of the van. ""He wanted to run away and was saying, 'I want to kill Muslims.'"" Abdulrahman claimed the driver said ""Kill me"" as he was being held on the ground by the crowd. Another witness, Hussain Ali, 28, said that while being restrained the suspect was protected by the people he is thought to have been targeting. He said: ""The leader of the mosque said 'You do not touch him.' He was sitting and holding him like that, people kept holding him."" Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu praised members of the public for their actions, saying ""their restraint in the circumstances was commendable""."
2017-06-19,The Supreme Court will rule today or tomorrow on whether doctors can continue to provide life support to 10-month-old Charlie Gard.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170619163206/http://news.sky.com/story/supreme-court-ruling-due-on-treatment-for-sick-baby-charlie-gard-10920386,"The British courts have already ruled that doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital should withdraw life support because it is not in Charlie's best interests to be kept alive. Lawyers for his parents have made a submission to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) arguing the ruling breaches the Human Rights act. The ECHR granted an interim ruling last week saying doctors should continue to treat Charlie while they considered the case. That ruling expires at midnight tonight. Following the ECHR ruling the Supreme Court told doctors it ""would not be unlawful"" for them to continue to provide life support. They will now consider whether to extend that judgment, and for how long. Charlie has a severe mitochondrial condition and in January suffered what doctors describe as irreversible brain damage. His parents Connie Yates and Christopher Gard want to take him to the United States for treatment which UK doctors say has ""zero"" chance of success. The court heard that earlier in legal proceedings, the parents' lawyers had written to the hospital saying they would consider complaining to the Crown Prosecution Service if treatment was withdrawn pending an appeal. Lawyers for Great Ormond Street said doctors would like guidance from the court in what treatment they can provide in the event of Charlie suffering an infection or cardiac arrest. ""This is the end of the line for the doctors and what they consider they can do for the child,"" Katie Gollop QC told the court."

Sources said he informed colleagues‎ of his plans to leave on Monday. Mr Brannigan's departure, which comes less than 10 months after he took up the role, ‎will raise renewed questions about Mrs May's dealings with the private sector. It also coincides with persistent rumours that John Godfrey, another senior figure in Downing Street who was ‎recruited from Legal & General after Mrs May became PM, is also on the verge of leaving. Sources said that Chris Hopkins, a business relations adviser at Number 10, was also expected to ‎depart. Business leaders have become increasingly alarmed about their lack of access to Downing Street at a critical time for many investors, with formal Brexit talks now underway. Mrs May decided to disband the Business Advisory Group which met on a quarterly basis under her predecessor, David Cameron, instead favouring occasional dinners with bosses and their spouses. Her determination to pursue a so-called 'hard Brexit', under which the UK would leave both the single market and the customs union, has set her at odds with a number of Cabinet colleagues, including the Chancellor, Philip Hammond. Mr Brannigan could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, while a Downing Street spokesman declined to comment."

As the child cries, a body covered in a blanket can be seen in the corner of the ruined classroom. During the video, a soldier explains that the boy had not eaten for days and was discovered while an army regiment advanced into Mosul's Old City. The child's mother and grandfather were among a number of people killed at the school in Bab Sinjar neighbourhood, he adds. On Sunday, Iraqi forces launched an assault to reclaim the Old City, the only district still under control of Islamic State militants in Mosul. US-backed Iraqi troops have been battling to capture the city for nine months. Iraqi Lieutenant General Abdul Ghani al Assadi said progress was slow but the battle ""is going as planned"". He said: ""We have many obstacles - the nature of the land, the nature of the construction, the roads and the civilian population - all of which make us slow down our work."" Troops have faced heavy sniper and mortar fire, while jihadists have also left a number of booby-traps in the streets of the Old City. There are fears for the safety of more than 100,000 civilians believed to be trapped in the district, but Lt Gen al Assadi said hundreds have managed to escape and approach Iraqi troops. As Iraqi troops launched their assault, soldiers parked Humvees by the Grand Mosque facing the Old City and mounted them with speakers. Using the loudspeakers, soldiers told IS fighters: ""You have only this choice: surrender or die""."

This is the area around a star which is considered neither too hot, nor too cold, to sustain complex life. Commenting on the discovery Kepler scientist Mario Perez said: ""Are we alone? Maybe Kepler today has told us indirectly, although we need confirmation, that we are probably not alone.""

 Kepler has already found dozens of worlds of interest and has still only looked at a tiny part of the galaxy. It has searched just a quarter of one per cent of a galaxy which holds around 200 billion stars. Of the 10 new planets which could sustain life, NASA says seven of them circle stars which are not unlike the Sun. The findings do not mean that the planets have life, just that the basic requirements for life have been met. In all, Kelper has discovered around 4,000 'candidate' planets but only about half of those have had their existence confirmed. Along with other methods of discovery it means scientists are now confident that they have identified around 3,600 exoplanets - around 60 of which could be habitable. Scientists say it will take at least another year before they are able to confirm what percentage of stars are likely to have Earth-like planets orbiting them Before Kepler's launch astronomers thought about 1% of stars were likely to have them. At conference of scientists in California at the weekend it was suggested the actual figure may be nearer to 60%. Caltech astronomer Courtney Dressing said: ""This number could have been very, very small. I, for one, am ecstatic."""

Tesco said: ""We're currently experiencing an IT issue which is affecting some Grocery Home Shopping orders.

2017-06-20,The Met Office has issued an amber heatwave warning - one level behind a national emergency - as another day of high temperatures sweeps the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170620201646/http://news.sky.com/story/amber-alert-marks-longest-heatwave-in-june-10921160,"But the weather is set to turn cooler towards the weekend, with temperatures projected to dip nearer 21C in London by Friday. The Met Office has said Britain is experiencing its longest spell of hot weather in June in decades. It is the first time since 1996 that temperatures reached more than 30C for five consecutive days. Monday was the hottest day of the year so far, with the temperature reaching 32.5C at Hampton Water Works in the South East. Peak temperatures of as high as 33C are anticipated as the week continues. But the weather will turn cooler and cloudier towards the weekend. ""It will be hot for a couple of days in the South,"" Sky News weather producer Chris England said. ""Then it will be cooler and generally more unsettled, possibly turning more settled and hotter towards July."" Temperatures on Tuesday were pegged at 29C in the South, but further north were lower at around 18C. Wednesday is set to see continued high temperatures of up to 31C in central London, but on Friday they will drop to around 21C. Grahame Madge, a spokesperson for the Met Office, said the hot weather was unusual. ""It's fairly rare. We've not really experienced anything like this for four years,"" he said. But the Met Office will not label the run of warm days as a heatwave. Instead it compared the current weather to previous spells when temperatures have topped 30C for more than five days. Globally, a heatwave is defined as five consecutive days when the temperature is 5C warmer than the monthly average. But by that calculation the last time Britain experienced a heatwave was in December 2016. ""It's challenging to come to up with a definition that fits with people's experience of a heatwave and is meaningful to people who aren't meteorologists,"" Mr Madge told Sky News. Factors like humidity or how hot it feels at night can also be taken into account. This week's amber health warning is based on a Department of Health and Met Office calculation. It is activated when there's an average temperature of 30C in the day and 15C at night. The NHS has urged people to spend time in the shade between 11am and 3pm, keep rooms cool and to stay hydrated. Age UK's Director of Policy Jane Vass said older people should take special care in the extreme temperatures. ""As you get older your body becomes less good at regulating its temperature, and medications you take may also affect how well it keeps your temperature down,"" she says. Other peaks in global temperature, however, have left the UK in the shade. In Phoenix, Arizona, temperatures on Tuesday peaked at 49C. The blistering heat nears a 20-year high in the US city, and has been described as ""deadly no matter how you slice it"" by American meteorologist Chris Breckenridge. Riyadh is experiencing highs of 44C, while temperatures in Baghdad stood at 40C and Delhi was 35C."

Mourners were asked to wear blue to the service in her hometown of Tottington, Greater Manchester. A St George's flag decorated with a bee - which has become a symbol of Manchester since the attack - was laid on top of Olivia's blue coffin, and there was applause as it was carried out of the church. :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack Olivia's friend Adam Lawler, who was also injured on the night of the attack, attended the service in a wheelchair. He told Sky News: ""What really hurts is that I was the person she spent her last moments with. ""But what I feel happy is about is that she spent those last moments happy. ""She was incredibly happy that night - from her last meal, to the last artist she would see play live, the last song she would hear. And she just loved it. ""She was always such a kind and happy person - always so loving. I feel like I've lost a great person, but I won't lose the great memories I have of her."" The Reverend Hugh Beam said ""threads of hope and love"" which ran throughout the service were ""the exact opposites of meaninglessness and hate"". Olivia's classmates wrote messages about her in the days after her death, which were displayed on the altar inside the church. The reverend paid tribute, saying: ""She was a girl with character and vitality. ""She is described in the words still on the altar as the kindest person with whom happy times were shared. ""A true friend with an amazing smile and a great laugh."" Olivia's family asked for donations to be made to the music room at Tottington High School, where the teenager was a student."

The case dates back to 2008 when the bank's rivals - Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland - took state bailouts as the financial sector came under huge strain. The SFO said: ""The charges relate to Barclays Plc's capital raising arrangements with Qatar Holding LLC and Challenger Universal Ltd, which took place in June and October 2008, and a $3bn loan facility made available to the State of Qatar acting through the Ministry of Economy and Finance in November 2008."" In addition to the allegations it was levelling against the bank, the SFO charged its-then chief executive John Varley and another senior executive at the time, Roger Jenkins, with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over the capital raisings. They are also facing a charge of unlawful financial assistance. Two other men in senior roles at the bank in 2008- Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath - face a single charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to the June 2008 fundraising only. The case is due in court on 3 July. The bank said in response that it was ""considering its position in relation to these developments"" and it had been informed by the SFO that it had not made a decision on whether to also bring charges against it in respect of the loan. It added that the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), had re-opened its investigation while US authorities were continuing their own inquiries. Barclays also reaffirmed it was defending a civil claim against it, brought by PCP Capital Partners and PCP International Finance, in relation to the second capital raising."

""I am ready to commit my energy, enthusiasm and experience to the task of leading the Liberal Democrats through what will be a period of chronic uncertainty. ""With the prospect of another election looming large, we must be ready for the fight."" The 74-year-old, who returned to the House of Commons as MP for Twickenham in the General Election, is the first contender to throw his hat into the ring to replace Tim Farron, who resigned earlier this month. Former health minister Norman Lamb has also indicated he is considering going for the job, but hotly tipped East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson has ruled herself out, saying she will try to become deputy leader instead. Former energy secretary Sir Ed Davey has also said he is giving ""serious thought"" to standing. Sir Vince said he is ready to ""work with like-minded people in other parties"" to secure a second referendum on any Brexit deal, with the option to remain in the EU if the agreement on offer is deemed not good enough. He described Brexit as an ""iceberg"" about to hit the UK economy and said the Lib Dems should ""warn of the dangers ahead and the need for a new course"". Despite the fact that the party secured only 7.4% of the vote and 12 seats in the election, Sir Vince insisted ""the political winds are moving in our favour"". He said: ""There are big opportunities ahead. The Conservatives are in disarray and in retreat. The Labour Party outperformed expectations but complacently believes that 'one more heave' will see it into office. ""But an economic policy based on offering lots of free things lacks economic credibility and will be found out. Investing in infrastructure, rather than borrowing for everyday running costs is credible. ""There is a big space in British politics which I am determined that we should occupy."" Sir Vince served as acting leader of the Lib Dems following the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell in 2007, but declined to stand for the leadership at that point, saying that an older candidate would not be electable because of ""irrational prejudice about age"". If elected, Sir Vince would be the party's oldest ever leader and the oldest leader of a major party since Sir Winston Churchill, who stepped down as Tory leader at the age of 80. Mr Farron surprised many in his party by announcing he was quitting days after the election, saying his Christian faith had made him a ""subject of suspicion"". The leadership contest will run throughout the summer, with the new leader elected by party members in a postal ballot in time for the start of the Lib Dem annual conference in Bournemouth on 16 September."

Ms Nicholson's body was found on a sofa she had slept on with Trigg in Worthing, West Sussex, in April 2011. At the time, Trigg said she died after he accidentally rolled on to her in his sleep. But Leeds Crown Court heard that a reassessment by Nathaniel Cary, a pathologist, concluded Ms Nicholson suffocated after having her head deliberately forced into fabric. Ms Devlin was discovered dead in her bed by one of her children on Mother's Day in March 2006. An initial post-mortem recorded her death as being naturally caused by an aneurysm, even though there was ""no physical finding"" to support this, the court heard. The court was told Dr Cary's reassessment of the mother-of-four's case found her death was caused by a blow to the back of the head. Jurors were told that both women were subjected to violence during their relationships with Trigg - and that the 52-year-old did not call the emergency services following either of their deaths. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said that when viewed in more depth, ""significant similarities"" between the two deaths emerged. He told the court the defendant had a history of behaving ""in a possessive, controlling and jealous way"" while in relationships with women. Neighbour Hannah Cooper said Ms Nicholson and Trigg had a ""volatile and violent"" relationship, with rows fuelled by alcohol. Police were called at least six times following bust-ups between the couple - and in March 2011, Trigg was cautioned for battery relating to a row in which Ms Nicholson was punched in the face. Last year, Trigg pleaded guilty to violent behaviour towards his then girlfriend Caroline O'Toole. She said: ""When he drinks he is a completely different person, he is like Jekyll and Hyde."" Trigg denies the murder of Ms Nicholson and the manslaughter of Ms Devlin. The case continues."

Commander Vitor Vaz Pinto said the Gois blaze was ""very fast and very explosive"" and had forced the evacuation of 11 hill villages. At least 64 people have died and over 150 injured in the blazes, which broke out in Pedrogao Grande over the weekend and spread quickly to other areas. More than 1,000 firefighters and almost 400 fire engines are still battling to control the flames. Meanwhile, there have been conflicting reports about whether a water-dropping plane involved in the operation to tackle devastating fires had crashed. An official at Portugal's air accident office, Maria Jose Andre, said she had been told by the civil protection agency that a Canadair plane had come down. But a spokesman for the civil protection agency said none of the planes fighting the deadly wildfires were missing. According to reports, the aircraft came down near the village of Ouzenda while tackling the blazes, which have already destroyed more than 64,000 acres of forest. A reporter said he heard a loud explosion and there had been thick smoke over the affected area. Some 30 water-dropping aircraft have been battling the blazes, some operating under bilateral agreements with the Portuguese government and others as part of an EU co-operation agreement. Planes from Spain, France, Italy and Morocco were among those helping to fight the fires. Of the 64 victims, 47 died on one particular road - the N236 highway - including 30 who burned to death in their cars after being trapped by the flames. It has been dubbed the ""road of death"" as Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa led calls to find out why it had not been shut. A survivor told Portuguese television that police directed them to the N236 as an alternative to the nearby IC8 route, which had been closed and which officers used themselves. ""When we arrived at the IC8, they told us we couldn't pass and directed us towards the N236. We thought that the road was safe but it wasn't,"" said Maria de Fatima. ""We couldn't see anything, we couldn't even see the road, just the flames and the pine trees falling on the road."""

And she will have to deal with the fallout of the van attack near the Finsbury Park mosque, which she said is being treated ""as a potential terrorist attack"". In her in-box this week - a major speech on Wednesday at the start of the Queen's Speech, where she will set out her legislative programme for the next two years.MPs won't actually vote on it until June 28, but her benches will be watching her closely - every performance a test of her mettle after her faltering response to the Grenfell Tower disaster last week.There is also the matter of the DUP confidence-and-supply deal that still needs to be nailed down. No 10 are confident that the Unionists will vote with Mrs May, giving her an expected majority of around 13 - but she has yet to reach agreement.That deal is complicated by the wider politics of Northern Ireland, amid concerns that the deal with the DUP could hamper efforts to re-establish the stalled power-sharing executive at Stormont: to that end, the Prime Minister will on Monday meet the new Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Downing Street.""We will discuss Northern Ireland and the need to re-establish devolved Government, and Brexit, focusing on how we can avoid any adverse impact on the rights and freedoms of our citizens, on trade and the economy,"" Mr Varadkar said ahead of his bi-lateral. Then of course, is the start of Brexit talks, the Tories' fragile peace holding over the weekend after her chancellor confirmed that there would be no rowing back on the promise to leave the single market and customs union. But those tensions will no doubt rise once more when the tussles over Britain's EU exit bill and the future deal begin in earnest. :: Labour claims Brexit 'disarray' on eve of talks in BrusselsHer MPs are in no doubt of her shortcomings - revealed in full technicolour during the election campaign, and then again last week when she initially failed to meet survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. ""Everyone knows she's not Mrs Emotional in public,"" said one minister, adding that they thought she had the support of most of her party still.But the stories about whether it's time for Mrs May to go - and who might replace her - won't dissipate. There are suggestions that once leader contender David Davis might be put up as a caretaker Prime Minister, rather as Michael Howard was back in 2004. There's talk of a ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge if she waters down Brexit - though there is no sign so far that she intends to do that.Another senior party figure said allies of Boris Johnson were taking soundings from colleagues, which was playing quite badly with some MPs who are adamant that further Tory infighting would play badly with the public. ""She's the only show in town,"" said the MP. ""The public don't want to see us knifing each other.""Mr Johnson's team insist any suggestion he's on manoeuvres is ""completely false"". ""Boris is supporting the Prime Minister and anyone doing this sort of thing is not acting with his knowledge or support,"" they say.While some in the party believe the Prime Minister is now a busted flush, opinion seems to be coalescing around the view that now is not the right time to change leader. As Philip Hammond, the chancellor put it on Sunday: ""I think what the country needs now is a period of calm while we get on with the job in hand. ""We've got one very serious issues to address, including the Brexit negotiations just starting. Theresa is leading the Government and I think the Government needs to get on with its job. ""And do you know what? I think actually that's what most people in this country will think - that the Government just needs to get on with the day job of Government.""Getting on with the job has become her new mantra as grand designs give way to hand to mouth survival. How long she stays in No 10 depends on her party, but for most MPs her continued leadership remains the least worst option - for now."

The talks have been ongoing since the Conservatives failed to win an outright parliamentary majority in a disastrous General Election on 8 June. But a deal remains elusive. Adding to the complications is the wider politics of Northern Ireland and the Government's attempts to restore the power-sharing executive at Stormont. The Government has rejected suggestions that its commitment to act with impartiality in Northern Ireland - as set out in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement - would be undermined by a deal with the DUP. Mrs May met with Irish premier Leo Varadkar on Tuesday, and spoke afterwards of the ongoing talks with DUP. ""We are talking about a confidence-and-supply agreement with them. On reaching such an agreement we will make sure that the details of that are made public so that people can see exactly what that is based on,"" she said. ""As a UK Government we remain absolutely steadfast in our commitment to the Belfast Agreement (and) its successor agreements."" Sky's Ireland Correspondent David Blevins said the ""debacle we have been witnessing over the last ten days is quite extraordinary"". ""Twenty-four hours before the Queen's speech there is no agreement. ""Remember this began the morning after the General Election result when Theresa May stood outside Number 10 and said she was going to form a Government with the help of allies and friends - even though at that point the only commitment she had from the Democratic Unionists was that they would engage in a conversation.""

Made of flammable plastic sandwiched between aluminium sheets, it is being blamed for spreading the fire from one floor to another in the 24-storey block. It will be a major focus of the investigations into why so many were killed in the devastating blaze last week - with at least 79 people confirmed dead or missing, presumed dead. :: Demand for answers on high-rise fire warnings Documents submitted to Kensington and Chelsea Council's planning department show residents were consulted in 2012 over the renovations and were asked what cladding they wanted. They show they chose a fire-resistant product called VMZ Composite which was said to have ""many benefits"". A newsletter handed to tenants and submitted with the planning application stated: ""Various cladding options have been shown to residents with the composite cladding system being favoured by the majority."" The document clearly stated the cladding had ""fire retardancy"". Two years later, a cheaper scheme was agreed and new proposals were approved by council planners. Instead of the fire-resistant panels chosen by residents, cheaper plastic-filled cladding was fitted. :: Firefighters' horror as they near Grenfell Tower blaze :: Fire patients kept unconscious to aid recovery Last weekend, the Government claimed Reynobond PE should not have been used - with Chancellor Philip Hammond and trade minister Greg Hands both saying it was banned. However, a panel of fire safety experts speaking at this week's FIREX exhibition in London said it is impossible to say whether the cladding is banned or not. Fire risk management consultant Stephen Mackenzie said the Government should have reviewed building regulations years ago. ""You can do secondary desktop studies to say you've done a check and balance and are comfortable with (flammable) material,"" he explained. ""It's down to the individual designer's specifier and or specialist installer - there is no straight answer."" :: The UK's terrible month of tragedy Jim Glockling, technical director at the Fire Protection Association, criticised the design process that allows flammable cladding to be used. ""I have heard expressions of concern about some of these assessments, for some time, that they may not be as rigorous as they ought to be,"" he said."
2017-06-20,Pollsters Ipsos MORI have been analysing how people voted in elections since 1974.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170620201646/http://news.sky.com/story/general-election-had-biggest-generation-gap-since-1970s-10921220,"They've just released their analysis for 2017 - and it shows how truly groundbreaking this election was. So what happened? :: Young people turned out… The proportion of young people aged 18-24 who voted was at its highest for 25 years. A total of 54% of all 18-24 year-olds - including those who were not registered to vote - turned out on 8 June, up 16 points from their turnout in 2015. Turnout was also up eight points among 25-34-year-olds, but was relatively unchanged for the rest of the population. Those aged 18-24 were just as likely to turn out as those aged 25-44 this time around, in a marked change from previous elections - though older people were still more likely to turn out overall, with 71% of those aged 65 and over voting. During the campaign Sky News invited a group of young first-time voters to set our editorial agenda for the day. They commissioned our journalists to cover the stories they are directly affected by and answer the questions they pose. We also asked them to guest edit a special Young Vote 2017 edition of the hugely popular Sky News Snapchat channel, as 70% of Sky News' audience on Snapchat is under 25. :: …and voted Labour in record numbers The 2017 election had the largest gap in vote by age ever recorded since Ipsos MORI started analysing how people voted in the October 1974 general election. Those aged 18-24 voted more for Labour by 62% to 27%, while those aged 65 and over voted more for the Conservatives by 61% to 25%. And they swung in different directions, with younger voters voting more for Labour than they did in 2015, and voting more for the Conservatives than last time. :: More working class people voted Tory Middle class voters in the ABC1 social grades were more likely than ever to vote Labour rather than Conservatives - and working class voters (C2DE social grades) were more likely than ever to vote for the Conservatives rather than Labour. Ties with their traditional votes had been weakening for decades, but with Labour up 12 points on their 2015 performance among middle class voters and the Conservatives up 12 points among the working class, both have very narrow leads among the classes they used to strongly rely on. :: People with degrees voted Labour Labour had a 15-point lead among graduates, while the Conservatives had a 17-point lead among those with no formal qualifications. This is obviously related to age and class, though the exact relationship - whether one causes the other - is unclear. :: BME voters abandoned the Conservatives Labour won a whopping 54-point lead among ethnic minorities, a swing of six points since 2015 - mostly as the Conservatives' vote share fell. Turnout among BME people was also up by six points. :: The Conservatives took the majority of former Ukippers Some 60% of those who voted UKIP in 2015 voted Tory this time around, compared with just 16% who voted Labour - only 18% stayed with UKIP. :: Labour gained from the Lib Dems and previous non-voters Almost a third (30%) of 2015 Lib Dems voted Labour this time, and 60% of 2015 non-voters who decided to vote this time voted Labour. :: Only half of 2015 Lib Dem voters voted Lib Dem this time While the overall vote share for the Lib Dems was relatively unchanged, there was a great deal of churn under the surface - only 51% of people who voted Lib Dem last time did so again this year, with rest coming roughly equally from Labour and the Conservatives. Demographically they still look pretty similar though - doing best among graduates and Remainers, and worse among those with no formal qualifications."
2017-06-20,"Britain has an ""acceptance"" of anti-Muslim rhetoric that would not be tolerated for other minorities, it has been claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170620201646/http://news.sky.com/story/is-islamophobia-on-the-rise-in-the-uk-10921247,"Matthew Feldman, who studies the contemporary far-right in Europe, also outlined how attacks on mosques or Muslim centres take place ""less than once every fortnight"" in the UK. The academic spoke to Sky News in the wake of the suspected terror attack on Muslim worshippers in north London on Monday. It followed recent jihadist-inspired attacks in Manchester and London Bridge, which Dr Feldman said had led to a spike in anti-Muslim hate crime. He described a five-fold rise in reporting of Islamophobic crimes following the Manchester attack and a two-fold rise after the London Bridge atrocity. Dr Feldman suggested there were ""increased rates of reporting when the Muslim community feels more threatened and more at risk after events like these"". But he also voiced fears such spikes never completely fell back to their previous level. He told Sky News: ""One of the concerns is that we don't go back to normal, we have an elevated level of hate crimes and hate reported incidents after these kinds of attacks."" Mohammed Khaliel, founder of community relations organisation Islamix, agreed ""the level doesn't come back to a lower base"" after terror attack-related increases, adding: ""It still remains at a slightly higher base."" Mr Khaliel suggested part of the problem in tackling hate crime is the ""resilience"" of Muslims also rises, with many failing to report hate crimes due to the difficulty in securing convictions. He said: ""I'm forever telling Muslim women and others 'report the crime'. They'll just put up with minor crimes."" Mr Khaliel described Muslim hijab-wearing women as the ""silent victims"" who have ""seen the brunt of these attacks"". He revealed how he recently witnessed someone spitting on Muslim women but they ""just took that spit and moved on, rather than reporting it as a hate crime"". Dr Feldman said: ""Unlike all other forms of ethnically-based or faith-based hate attacks which are majority male-on-male, anti-Muslim hate attacks are majority male-on-female. That has to be very concerning."" The Teeside University academic said the narrative used by both far-right extremists and jihadists of a looming ""violent civil war"" needed to be ""vigorously contested"". Dr Feldman also called for ""all citizens of goodwill"" to confront an ""acceptance of anti-Muslim discourse that we would find absolutely noxious if it was about someone from an ethnic minority or other religious background"". He said: ""We're looking at an attack on a mosque or a Muslim community centre less than once every fortnight over the last four years. ""I think that would be unacceptable with synagogues, with churches, with any other places of congregation for particular minority communities."""

He lost, but is challenging the result with the certification officer. Mr Coyne's supporters accused Mr McCluskey of ""panic and desperation"" when the suspension was announced, blaming ""Red Len"" for the move. The election was one of the most bitter in the trade union movement in recent years, with both candidates trading insults about the lifestyle and conduct of their opponent. Mr Coyne said he was told by email that he had been sacked from his position after a disciplinary hearing. He said he was ""deeply disappointed, but not surprised"", and said he intended to appeal. ""When you are in a kangaroo court, you are rarely surprised by the outcome,"" Mr Coyne said. ""I have held the post for 16 years and no complaint was raised during the hearing about how I carried out that role. ""However, during the disciplinary process, I was informed that union rules require a regional secretary to be 'the general secretary's representative in the region'. ""It was implied that, because of the way I criticised Len McCluskey during the campaign, I could not fulfil that role."" A Unite spokesman said: ""The decision is subject to a right of appeal to Unite's executive council, and the union will be offering no further comment on the matter."""
2017-06-20,"Nearly a decade after the financial crisis, its tentacles have finally reached out into the criminal courts.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170620201646/http://news.sky.com/story/barclays-in-the-dock-the-central-allegation-against-the-bank-10921150,"A bank and four of its most senior former employees all charged with a fraud involving billions of pounds and the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar. It has all the ingredients of a crucial case at a crucial time. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is fighting for its future, while Barclays has suffered years of reputational hits. Neither will want to back down now. To understand these charges, you do have to cast your mind back to the febrile atmosphere of 2008, when British banks were facing a sudden and devastating funding crisis. :: Former Barclays bosses face criminal charges RBS and Lloyds both resorted to massive, life-saving bailouts from the British government, but Barclays didn't. Instead, it arranged a huge funding deal with investors in Qatar, which arrived in two multibillion pound tranches five months apart. The way in which those deals were constructed is now at the heart of the SFO's case. Fees of around £320m were paid to advisers, but there has been almost no information about who got that money, and why. The second set of allegations may seem even more curious - the idea that Barclays gave money to Qatar, in order to send it straight back to the bank. The allegation is that the bank, worried about its capital position, lent money to Qatar, in order that most of that money could be spent on buying its own shares, bolstering the appearance of the bank's financial position. It's a practice known as ""unlawful financial assistance"", and it is, as the name suggests, against the law. I'm told that the bank will vehemently fight against this. So far, the public response offered by the bank has been pretty muted - a statement of facts followed by the insight that the bank is ""considering its positions"". Behind closed doors in Canary Wharf, though, the bank is seething. Barclays feels that it is being held to a different moral standing to other banks. A senior figure at the bank on Tuesday compared its actions during the financial crisis with those of RBS and HBOS, both of which needed to be rescued through the public purse. ""We were all told that the over-riding interest was in the stability of the financial system,"" said the source. ""We didn't cost the taxpayer anything, there was no zombie bank and nobody was disadvantaged."" The bank says it still hasn't had a statement of facts, so can't predict how it will plead. However, I'm told Barclays officials feel they were never offered the chance to sign a deferred prosecution agreement - the mechanism by which big companies, facing this sort of legal action, can pay a huge fine to avoid prosecution. In recent times, both Rolls Royce and Tesco have agreed such deals, priced at £497m and £129m respectively. The SFO, which faces abolition under the terms of a pledge made in the Conservative manifesto, may feel that it could earn more money, and more plaudits, from a successful court case. For Barclays, this is yet another high-profile problem to deal with. Beleaguered by years of problems around Libor and PPI, the bank's dealing with Qatar remains under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority, the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The current chief executive, Jes Staley, is also facing an inquiry into his own efforts to identify a whistle-blower at the bank. It would be a remarkable litany, were it not for the fact that we have all become accustomed to accusations of misbehaviour by our banks. Confronted by these criminal charges Barclays share price barely moved this morning."
2017-06-20,A woman who posed as a model to entrap a man into participating in a plot to kill police officers in a bomb attack has been jailed for 16 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170620201646/http://news.sky.com/story/bomber-christine-connor-jailed-for-targeting-police-in-belfast-attack-10921477,"Christine Connor used a fake online profile to indoctrinate Stuart Downes with her views, a judge said. Using a fictitious name and a picture of Swedish model Sanne Alexandra Andersson, Connor persuaded Downes to purchase explosives and ship them to Belfast. She went on to attack police in north Belfast with blast bombs on two occasions after luring officers into the area with bogus 999 calls. No one was seriously injured in the explosions. The 31-year-old gasped as she was sentenced to 16 years and four months in jail by Judge David McFarland at Belfast Crown Court. She was convicted of attempting to murder a police officer, as well as other offences. A prosecution barrister had told the court Connor had been motivated by terrorism and her ""primary purpose"" was to kill police officers. Downes, from Shrewsbury, was charged with a series of offences connected to the May 2013 attack, but took his own life last year. Judge McFarland described him as a ""pitiful, troubled and vulnerable young man"" - and said his involvement with Connor was a mystery. He told Connor: ""It's within your power to manipulate others. You are committed to a violent philosophy to achieve political objectives. ""You have shown little remorse. I find you dangerous."" The judge said there were ""disturbing and sinister"" aspects to Connor's relationship with Downes and that she ""appears to have been the controlling influence"". According to police, Connor also used her fake profile to entrap Zachary Gevelinger, an American citizen who, like Downes, had no previous connections to Northern Ireland. He was arrested and questioned after visiting Connor at Hydebank Prison in July 2013, but later also took his own life. A defence lawyer for Connor had asked the court to ""extend leniency"" because she has a number of health problems and would find life in prison ""particularly difficult"". She will spend three years and eight months on licence once she is released from prison, and is entitled to apply to the Parole Board for an early release. Connor waved at her family in the public gallery as she was taken away by prison guards. Outside court, Detective Superintendent Richard Campbell said he welcomed the sentence, adding: ""She has a very twisted political ideology which she has been determined to pursue through violence."""

He said some had clung to banisters to feel their way down 20 flights of stairs in acrid smoke. Twelve patients were admitted to the south London hospital immediately after the fire on Wednesday morning. Seven are still receiving treatment. Mr Bew said his colleagues were expecting to receive hundreds of patients on the night of the blaze. ""As time went on and we realised that we weren't going to receive those casualties, it was very sad,"" he said. ""The people at the scene had stayed in their flats because that's what they were told to do, but the flames were coming up the external panels, to their windows and to their homes."" Some survivors may take weeks and months to recover from physical injuries, Mr Bew said, but he believes the psychological impact of the disaster may take even longer to get over. Mr Bew said he believed some of his patients went back into the building to save other families after escaping with their own. ""People went into the stairwells and went into toxic smoke,"" he said. ""Some of them went down 20 flights of stairs. There was this intense heat and they were feeling their way down banisters. ""I think people who escaped felt that they were going to die and that the only way to stay alive was to go through the smoke."" At least 79 people are confirmed dead or missing, presumed dead after the disaster, although the number is expected to rise. Only five victims have been formally identified."
2017-06-20,"Karen Bradley, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, is expected to give her verdict on 21st Century Fox's £18.5bn takeover of Sky plc, the owner of Sky News, by Thursday next week.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170620201646/http://news.sky.com/story/regulators-cma-and-ofcom-deliver-sky-takeover-reports-10921364,"Ms Bradley confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that she has now received a report from Ofcom, the broadcasting and telecoms regulator, on whether it would be in the public interest for the deal to go ahead. She said she had also received a parallel report on the takeover by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and a separate report from Ofcom into whether the directors of Fox, the world's fourth-largest media company after Comcast, Disney and Time Warner, were ""fit and proper"" to hold a UK broadcasting licence. The Secretary of State said she was aiming to give an oral statement to Parliament on the matter by 29 June. There would then be a further opportunity for interested parties to make further representations. Fox, the international film and television giant behind hit shows like The Simpsons and Modern Family, already owns a 39.1% stake in Sky. It tabled a proposal just before Christmas to buy the remainder of the company for £11.7bn, valuing the whole of Sky at £18.5bn. Ms Bradley asked Ofcom in March to investigate, under the 2002 Enterprise Act, whether the takeover was in the public interest on the grounds of media plurality and broadcasting standards. The plurality issue concerned whether the Murdoch family, which is a major shareholder in both News Corporation - the owner of The Sun, The Times and the Sunday Times - and Fox, would emerge from a takeover with too large a share of the UK news market. The broadcasting standards issue strand of the investigation was an assessment of Fox's commitment to uphold UK broadcasting standards. Ofcom also simultaneously carried out an examination of whether Fox and its senior directors were ""fit and proper"", in the industry jargon, to hold UK broadcasting licences. That followed complaints from critics of the Murdoch family including Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, and Sir Vince Cable, the former business secretary. On the plurality issue, Fox is thought to have argued that the takeover would not lead to a concentration of UK media assets due to recent changes in the UK media landscape, highlighting how, due to the rapid proliferation of the internet, there is more choice and diversity in the news market than before. Newspaper circulation has declined by almost two-fifths during the current decade while the rise of web-based news providers such as Buzzfeed, along with the way the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter have changed the way people consume news, mean that the combined share of News Corp and Fox of the UK news market has fallen. Together, the pair would own just three of the top 15 UK news providers by audience reach - Sky News, The Sun and the Sky News website. The BBC alone, meanwhile, accounts for seven of the top 15 providers. The 'fit and proper' issue is thought to have occupied more of Ofcom's time. The regulator received representations from critics of Fox, including Mr Miliband and Sir Vince. It also held a meeting with Wendy Walsh, one of five women who claims to have suffered sexual harassment at the hands of Bill O'Reilly, a former star presenter on Fox News who was fired in April. Ms Bradley must now decide, based on the reports she has received from Ofcom and the CMA, whether or not the takeover would operate against the public interest. If she decides that it would do so, she can then refer the takeover to the CMA for a full review, a process that would take six months. Alternatively, she may decide to allow the deal to go ahead, or allow it to go ahead subject to Fox meeting certain conditions. She said: ""I will aim to give my initial 'minded to' decision, publish the CMA and Ofcom public interest reports - in line with the Enterprise Act 2002 - and return to Parliament to make an oral statement by Thursday 29 June. ""There will then be an opportunity for representations to be made before I make a final decision. ""In the meantime, given the quasi-judicial nature of the process, I am unable to comment substantively on the matter of the case. ""My priority remains - as it has throughout this proposed merger - to make my decision independently, following a process that is scrupulously fair and impartial, and as quickly as possible."" Sky first received a takeover approach from News Corporation, then the owner of Fox, in June 2010. That bid was also referred to Ofcom, which agreed to allow the deal to go through, provided Sky News was spun off into a separate company. However, the following July, the bid was dropped following public anger at revelations that the News of the World had hacked the mobile phone of murdered teenager Milly Dowler. News Corporation subsequently demerged into two businesses. One, continuing under the name News Corporation, is largely a publishing company that owns titles including the Wall Street Journal, The Australian, the New York Post, The Sun, The Times and the Sunday Times, as well as the commercial radio broadcaster Talk Radio. The other, 21st Century Fox, owns film and television assets around the world. Its only UK asset at present is its existing shareholding in Sky. A separate review by the European Commission has already given a green light to the takeover. Shares of Sky, which are valued at 1075p each under the takeover, were down 1.5p at 958.5p at 3.10pm on Tuesday."

In a statement on behalf of the family, Ellis, 26, said: ""We are massively shocked; it's unbelievable, it still hasn't really sunk in. ""We are devastated for the families, our hearts go out to the people who have been injured."" He added: ""Its madness. It is obviously sheer madness."" Darren Osborne, a 47-year-old who is believed to be a father-of-four from Cardiff, was arrested after the group were struck by a van near Finsbury Park Mosque in north London early on Monday. The worshippers had been at a Muslim welfare centre as part of celebrations for the holy month of Ramadan. Witnesses at the scene described it as a deliberate attack and senior officers said it was being treated as a ""terrorist incident"". Some said they heard the van driver, who was detained by members of the public at the scene, shout: ""I'm going to kill Muslims."" Police have been searching a residential address in Pentwyn, a suburb to the northeast of Cardiff, where Mr Osborne has been listed as living. His neighbour Khadijeh Sherizi said she could not believe Mr Osborne was being investigated for carrying out an attack on Muslim worshippers. ""He has been so normal,"" she said. ""He was in his kitchen yesterday afternoon singing with his kids. ""He was the dad of the family. He has kids. He lives next door. He seemed polite and pleasant to me. ""I just can't believe it."" Theresa May visited Finsbury Park Mosque on Monday, which is close to the scene of the attack, and met with community and faith leaders. Later, Scotland Yard Commissioner Cressida Dick joined a vigil outside the mosque. Following a meeting with the chairman of the mosque, Mohammed Kozbar, Ms Dick stood with him during a short silence, before he addressed the large crowd. Mr Kozbar said: ""These people, these extremists, their aim is to divide our communities, is to spread hatred, fear and division among our communities. ""We all have harmony in this area, and these people try to divide us, but we tell them that we will not let you do that."" Other faith leaders from the community also spoke at the vigil, including the Bishop of Stepney the Rt Rev Adrian Newman. He told the crowd ""an attack on one faith is an attack on us all"". Rabbi Herschel Gluck said the incident was an attack on ""every single Muslim in the UK and beyond"". Ms Dick said earlier on Monday that the incident was quite clearly an attack on Muslims, but did not address the crowd at the vigil. The Met Police said extra police patrols were being deployed to reassure the public and those observing Ramadan. London Ambulance Service said it took nine people to hospital. Two others were treated for minor injuries at the scene. Police said the attack happened while a man, who later died, was receiving first aid after being taken ill. The force has not made it clear whether there is any link between his death and the attack. The welfare centre's imam, Mohammed Mahmoud, was hailed for his efforts after he stopped a group attacking the suspect and helped detain him until police came."

Led by Stavros Keppas, the team from the School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Science published their findings in Geophysical Research Letters. They noted how they had been enjoying a pleasant research flight over the northeast Atlantic Ocean last September when they spotted a significant concentration of curious ice formations. The ice had taken the shape of a stick with a spherical head at the end, resembling an ice-lolly, according to the researchers. Dr Keppas said this wasn't even the first time they had observed the strange ice formations, which were also noticed over the southwest of the UK in 2009. He explained: ""Ice-lollies are the product of the collision between an ice column and a liquid water droplet in the air. ""Ice splinters are created at temperatures between -3C and -8C in the cloud and instantly freeze any water droplet they touch, creating these unusual ice-lolly shapes. ""The Ice crystals grow into distinctive and somewhat predictable shapes, depending on the temperature, amount of water vapour and humidity."" Alas, there's not much hope for anyone planning on eating one to stave off the heat. According to the team, they're not only just a millimetre long, but they're only found at altitudes between one and two kilometres in the air. Not that the research was all in vain, according to Dr Keppas.

2017-06-21,"An embattled Theresa May faced accusations of having a ""threadbare legislative programme"" and no political credibility left after she tore up much of the Conservative manifesto in the Queen's Speech.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170621173129/http://news.sky.com/story/queens-speech-corbyn-attacks-government-without-majority-10922487,"The blueprint for the next two years delivered at the opening of Parliament focused largely on Brexit, and stayed away from flagship policies in the Tory manifesto. Jeremy Corbyn called it a ""threadbare legislative programme from a Government that has lost its majority and apparently run out of ideas altogether"". During a heated parliamentary debate, the Labour leader focused on what was not in the Queen's Speech, and criticised the Government and its public sector cuts. ""This is a Government without a majority, without a mandate, without a serious legislative programme, led by a Prime Minister who's lost her political authority and is struggling even today to stitch together a deal to stay in office,"" Mr Corbyn said. :: Queen's Speech: What's in and what's out ""Austerity and inequality are choices, they are not necessities,"" he said. ""They are a choice to make life worse for the many to maintain the privilege of the few."" Emboldened by a better than expected election result, Mr Corbyn said his party was ""not merely an opposition: we are a government in waiting"". Mrs May sought to strike a humble tone as she set out her legislative programme, saying she would listen more closely to Parliament and businesses' concerns about Brexit. In the debate, she issued an apology for the Grenfell Tower fire. The Prime Minister called for ""compassion, unity, resolve"" as she said: ""This is a difficult time for our country, but we are a resilient country."" And she said it was important to have a Government that would act in the national interest. Brexit dominated the Queen's Speech: out of 27 Bills and draft bills unveiled in the address, eight were devoted to divorce procedures, including a Repeal Bill to overturn the 1972 Act which took Britain into what was then the European Economic Community. In the wake of the Grenfell blaze and the terror attacks, Mrs May also announced plans for a civil disaster taskforce and a new commission for countering extremism, as well as a review of counter-terror strategy. The speech was as notable for what it omitted as for what it included. It did not mention a reform of social care funding, which opponents branded a ""dementia tax"", the scrapping of universal free school lunches or means-testing of the winter fuel payment. There was also no mention of the promised free vote on fox hunting or of a state visit by Donald Trump. Outgoing Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said a ""slimmed down Queen's Speech shows a Government on the edge"". As MPs debated, a few hundred protesters gathered for a so-called ""Day of Rage"" outside Parliament, with a few scuffles breaking out. The programme goes to a vote in the Commons next week, which amounts to a de-facto confidence vote in the Prime Minister. Mrs May has yet to seal a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government, but a DUP MP said after the Queen's Speech that progress was being made. ""We have identified the key issues that will form part of the confidence-and-supply arrangements that we want to put in place for a five-year Parliament,"" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told Sky News. ""I'm confident we can get an agreement."""

Hundreds of people lined the streets to see her funeral procession, which included riders on scooters decorated with balloons and flags. Mourners were asked to wear blue to the service in her hometown of Tottington, Greater Manchester. A St George's flag decorated with a bee - which has become a symbol of Manchester since the attack - was laid on top of Olivia's blue coffin, and there was applause as it was carried out of the church. :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack Olivia's friend Adam Lawler, who was also injured on the night of the attack, attended the service in a wheelchair. He told Sky News: ""What really hurts is that I was the person she spent her last moments with. ""But what I feel happy is about is that she spent those last moments happy. ""She was incredibly happy that night - from her last meal, to the last artist she would see play live, the last song she would hear. And she just loved it. ""She was always such a kind and happy person - always so loving. I feel like I've lost a great person, but I won't lose the great memories I have of her."" The Reverend Hugh Beam said ""threads of hope and love"" which ran throughout the service were ""the exact opposites of meaninglessness and hate"". Olivia's classmates wrote messages about her in the days after her death, which were displayed on the altar inside the church. The reverend paid tribute, saying: ""She was a girl with character and vitality. ""She is described in the words still on the altar as the kindest person with whom happy times were shared. ""A true friend with an amazing smile and a great laugh."" Olivia's family asked for donations to be made to the music room at Tottington High School, where the teenager was a student."

No other details were disclosed by Buckingham Palace, and it is not known how long he will be kept under the watchful eye of medics. He appeared to be in good health at the opening day of Royal Ascot with the Queen earlier on Tuesday. The pair were joined at the sporting and social occasion by other senior members of the Royal family, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Philip was supposed to be returning there on Wednesday afternoon and also accompanying the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament. His place at the latter was taken by Prince Charles. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in London last night, as a precautionary measure, for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition."" He said the Duke was ""in good spirits"" but ""disappointed"" to be missing both events. ""Her Majesty is being kept informed and will attend Royal Ascot as planned,"" the spokesman added. It is not the first time the Duke has missed an official engagement. After recovering from a blocked coronary artery in 2011, he suffered a bladder infection the following year and missed the vast majority of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The Duke, who celebrated his 96th birthday on 10 June, announced he was giving up his public duties from the autumn last month. He still has a busy calendar of engagements to fulfil before he steps down, including hosting the King and Queen of Spain next month. Royal aides said at the time that his decision to take a step back from royal duties - which can often involve extensive travel - was not health-related. They said he would continue to attend royal events and not completely disappear from public life, adding: ""He's looking forward to enjoying more of his leisure time."" Over the years he has made 637 solo overseas trips, given about 5,500 speeches. He has also authored 14 books. An advocate of a healthy lifestyle, he has said in the past that he more or less follows the Atkins (low carbohydrate) diet and drinks moderately, mostly sticking to beer. He reportedly takes the stairs rather than lifts - and still fits into the uniform he wore on his wedding day."

After the Tories' failure to win a majority at this month’s snap General Election, there are also notable absences from the Government’s plans.  :: BREXIT :: Great Repeal Bill - A huge piece of planned legislation that aims to replicate all existing EU law into British law by the time of Britain’s departure from the EU. It will also revoke the 1972 European Communities Act, which makes Brussels legislation supreme in the UK. :: Customs Bill - With Theresa May planning to take Britain out of the EU's Customs Union, legislation is required to implement a new customs regime in order to continue the flow of goods across Britain’s borders. :: Trade Bill - By leaving the Customs Union, Britain will be allowed to sign free trade deals with non-EU countries. This Bill aims to put in place the legal framework for the UK to sign any possible deals. :: Immigration Bill - Both the Tories and Labour have said EU freedom of movement rules will end once Brexit is complete. This Bill will aim to implement a new immigration policy for EU nationals. :: Fisheries Bill - Leaving the EU could see Britain quit the bloc’s Common Fisheries Policy. Legislation will be needed for the UK to manage its waters. :: Agriculture Bill - The UK's departure from the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy will similarly see new laws needed to manage farmland and the environment. :: Nuclear Safeguards Bill - Another area in which new powers will be needed once Britain leaves the EU, with international safeguards required to be put in place once the UK quits the bloc's Euratom organisation. :: International Sanctions Bill - Britain currently places international sanctions on other countries through the European Council but will needs new legislation to take such decisions outside the EU.  :: TERRORISM AND DISASTERS :: A new Commission for Countering Extremism will be given the task of supporting the Government in ""stamping out extremist ideology in all its forms"". There will also be a review of counter-terrorism strategy to make sure police and security services have ""all the powers they need to protect our country"". :: In the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, plans have been confirmed for a public inquiry into the tragedy. The Government also plans to introduce an independent public advocate to act for bereaved families after a disaster.  :: ECONOMY AND INFRASTRUCTURE:: HS2 Phase 2 Bill - Legislation is planned to grant powers to build the second phase of the high speed rail line from Birmingham to Crewe as part of the £55.7bn project.:: Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill - Motorway service stations and major petrol station chains will be required to install charging points for electric vehicles.:: Space Industry Bill - Planned new powers will allow the licensing of new commercial space flights.  :: OTHERS:: Courts Bill - A bid to make English and Welsh courts more efficient and accessible, including plans to ease the judicial process for victims of domestic abuse.:: Civil Liability Bill - Plans to cut whiplash insurance claims will see proposals to settle claims without the support of medical evidence and a new fixed tariff for payments.:: Armed Forces Bill - The Government hopes to attract more women to join the armed forces with proposals on part-time service, changes to maternity and paternity leave, and arrangements to ensure individuals are not deployed too far from home.:: Data Protection Bill - Proposals to strengthen rights and hand people more control over their data, including a right to be forgotten.  :: WHAT'S MISSING? :: Donald Trump state visit - There is no mention of the US President's state visit despite a reference to King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain's visit in July. :: Grammar schools - The signature policy of the Prime Minister, which proved contentious with some of her own MPs, does not appear following the loss of the Tories' majority. :: Social Care - The manifesto promise to reform social care funding, which arguably sank the Conservatives' General Election campaign, is missing although a promise to consult about changes to the system remains. :: Fox-hunting - There is no commitment for a free vote on whether to repeal the ban on hunting with dogs, which appears to have been ditched along with other pre-election pledges such as the scrapping of universal free school lunches, means-testing of the winter fuel payment, a watering down of the pensions triple lock and an energy price cap."

The Prime Minister put forward a Brexit-heavy legislative programme in her Queen's Speech, with eight bills dedicated to the process of leaving the European Union. Gone is her ""transformative"" programme to re-introduce grammar schools, end free school meals for primary school children, hold a vote on fox-hunting, scrap the triple lock on pensions and means test the winter fuel allowance. :: Queen's Speech - What's in and what's out? Forced to drop controversial policies that she won't be able to pass through Parliament, Mrs May has also had to significantly water down the central plank of her manifesto - social care reform. Her plan to force pensioners to pay for residential care until they have just £100,000 in assets is also shelved with a promise to ""work to improve social care"" and ""bring forward proposals for consultation"". There is also no mention of her energy market reform to bring down consumers' bills, although Number 10 could try to push that as a non-legislative measure. In total, she is putting forward 27 draft bills over the next two years - against the 51 offered up by David Cameron in the 2015 and 2016 parliamentary sessions - in a sign of how constrained she is by the parliamentary maths. Even with the support of the DUP (the deal is yet to be done), the Prime Minister will only have a working majority of 12, leaving her with a huge task to pass the Queen's Speech through both the Commons and Lords. The complexity of Brexit has also been underlined as the Government sets out eight bills to deliver Britain's exit from the EU. In addition to the Repeal Bill to transpose EU legislation into British law is a bill to end freedom of movement and impose immigration controls. Mrs May has excluded the explicit pledge to reduce immigration to the ""tens of thousands"", despite saying she wanted to achieve this by the end of this Parliament. There is also a bill to create a standalone UK customs regime given the Government's promise to leave the EU tariff-free customs union, as well as draft legislature to put in place the framework to strike trade deals around the world. Meanwhile, there is also a fisheries bill to take control of Britain's waters and a plan to give farmers support as they lose subsidies when the UK leaves the Commons Agriculture Policy. The Queen's Speech also includes a Nuclear Safeguards Bill to meet international standards as the UK leaves the EU's Euratom nuclear body, and an International Sanctions Bill to ensure Britain complies with international law. With the controversial elements of her domestic agenda shelved, the Prime Minister is trying to find areas where she can find cross-party agreement. This includes pushing through a bill to tackle unfair fees on tenants, a crackdown on the ""rampant compensation culture"" that pushes up insurance premiums and a domestic violence bill which aims to establish a victims' commissioner. Missing from the speech is news of President Trump's much anticipated state visit, which had been pencilled in for October. Government sources told Sky News this did not mean it was not going to happen, but the absence of a date casts further doubt on the prospect of a trip this year. One Tory minister said the number of bills was ""not too empty"", although is well below the legislative frenzy of Tony Blair's 2005 administration when 45 bills were laid. A low point came in the final year of the Tory-Lib coalition when the two sides could only agree on 11 bills. It was a sign of how difficult legislation can be to pass in coalition government and in Mrs May's case, minority government."

They had expected a higher figure as rising inflation takes its toll on consumer demand - damaging economic growth. :: The troubling rise and rise of inflation But the ONS figures also showed a rosier-than-anticipated picture for net borrowing across the financial year to date. The deficit narrowed last month, it said, as tax receipts rose by £2.6bn to £52.7bn. The VAT sales tax raked-in £11.2bn - a rise of £500m on the same month last year. The income tax and corporation tax take were also up. However, Government spending rose by £2.2bn to £55.8bn last month. Economists predict its efforts to bring the deficit down will be pressured by an expected weakening of the economy as the effects of the Brexit vote start to bite. The loss of its parliamentary majority is also forcing ministers to consider loosening the purse strings. Experts said Chancellor Philip Hammond, who earlier this week stressed that the Government was prepared to borrow more in order to invest and thereby boost economic growth and raise living standards, would take some cheer from the figures. ""Of course, the extent to which the Government will increase borrowing depends on the magnitude of the overall economic slowdown and the kind of Brexit deal the UK will reach with the EU,"" said Oliver Kolodseike, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr). Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said: ""May's strong VAT receipts look to be the lagged impact of April's spike in retail sales as a result of the later Easter and warm weather."" But he cautioned: ""While the performance of the public finances in April-May suggest that fiscal year 2017/18 could see a similar shortfall to the £46.2bn seen in 2016/17, a weakening economy is expected to take an increasing toll on the public finances over the coming months.

The first all-electric car to be built in the UK rolled off of the production line in 2013, and the Government wants ""almost every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050"". Of more than 36.7 million licensed vehicles in the UK, just over 100,000 have been purchased with help from a government plug-in car grant. The speed of adoption has been slowed by a number of factors, including the perceived cost of electric vehicles, according to Dr Ben Lane, a director at charging-point company Zap-Map. However, the perception of their expense is not always accurate, Dr Lane told Sky News, as the relative newness of most of the electric car models made their price seem higher than other vehicles. The availability of second-hand electric cars is making them more affordable. The distance electric cars are able to travel on a single battery charge has also discouraged consumers, as has the availability of charging points and the speed of recharging. Dr Lane said he ""strongly welcomed"" the Government's proposed law. ""Together with more open access, it's exactly what the market needs and electric vehicle drivers will welcome this development,"" he said. Registrations of electric vehicles are increasing, with 13,800 being registered in the first quarter of 2017, a 17% rise on the same period the year before. Plans to fund the additional electric charging points have not yet been announced, although the Government said it was committed to spending £600m during this Parliament to support the ultra-low emissions market. The new law also aims to support British manufacturing and innovation by allowing self-driving cars to operate in the country. Earlier this year, tests of electric self-driving cars by manufacturer Nissan took place on public roads in London. Official research has indicated the market for automated vehicles in the UK could be worth £28bn by 2035. This would be supported by making it compulsory for motor vehicle insurance to cover automated vehicles so that compensation claims can be paid quickly in the event of any accidents."

Sir Jeffrey adds his party ""like a lot"" of what was in the Queen's Speech, adding that Tory policies put forward during the election campaign that caused them concern are ""fading into the background"". He said he did not see any possible deal breakers. For Mrs May, negotiating the deal with the DUP is a balancing act. Adding to the complications is the wider politics of Northern Ireland and the Government's attempts to restore the power-sharing executive at Stormont. The Government has rejected suggestions that its commitment to act with impartiality in Northern Ireland - as set out in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement - would be undermined by a deal with the DUP."

No 10 are confident that the Unionists will vote with Mrs May, giving her an expected majority of around 13 - but she has yet to reach agreement.That deal is complicated by the wider politics of Northern Ireland, amid concerns that the deal with the DUP could hamper efforts to re-establish the stalled power-sharing executive at Stormont: to that end, the Prime Minister will on Monday meet the new Irish PM Leo Varadkar in Downing Street.""We will discuss Northern Ireland and the need to re-establish devolved Government, and Brexit, focusing on how we can avoid any adverse impact on the rights and freedoms of our citizens, on trade and the economy,"" Mr Varadkar said ahead of his bilateral meeting. Then, of course, is the start of Brexit talks, the Tories' fragile peace holding over the weekend after her Chancellor confirmed that there would be no rowing back on the promise to leave the single market and customs union. But those tensions will no doubt rise once more when the tussles over Britain's EU exit bill and the future deal begin in earnest. :: Labour claims Brexit 'disarray' on eve of talks in BrusselsHer MPs are in no doubt of her shortcomings - revealed in full technicolour during the election campaign, and then again last week when she initially failed to meet survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. ""Everyone knows she's not Mrs Emotional in public,"" said one minister, adding that they thought she had the support of most of her party still.But the stories about whether it's time for Mrs May to go - and who might replace her - won't dissipate. There are suggestions that once leader contender David Davis might be put up as a caretaker Prime Minister, rather as Michael Howard was back in 2004. There's talk of a ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge if she waters down Brexit - though there is no sign so far that she intends to do that.Another senior party figure said allies of Boris Johnson were taking soundings from colleagues, which was playing quite badly with some MPs who are adamant that further Tory infighting would play badly with the public. ""She's the only show in town,"" said the MP. ""The public don't want to see us knifing each other.""Mr Johnson's team insist any suggestion he's on manoeuvres is ""completely false"". ""Boris is supporting the Prime Minister and anyone doing this sort of thing is not acting with his knowledge or support,"" they say.While some in the party believe the Prime Minister is now a busted flush, opinion seems to be coalescing around the view that now is not the right time to change leader. As Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, put it on Sunday: ""I think what the country needs now is a period of calm while we get on with the job in hand. ""We've got one very serious issues to address, including the Brexit negotiations just starting. Theresa is leading the Government and I think the Government needs to get on with its job. ""And do you know what? I think actually that's what most people in this country will think - that the Government just needs to get on with the day job of Government.""Getting on with the job has become her new mantra as grand designs give way to hand-to-mouth survival. How long she stays in No 10 depends on her party, but for most MPs her continued leadership remains the least worst option - for now."

Such holidaymakers are often targeted by touts working for so-called ambulance chasers, the industry claims, who use the fact all meals are eaten at the same hotel to bolster their case - winning thousands of pounds. TUI, which owns the Thomson and First Choice holiday brands, said that since spring 2016 it had recorded 15 times more sickness claims than in previous years, despite reported sickness levels remaining stable. The company's UK managing director said it had caused ""friction"" with hotel owners. Nick Longman told the Press Association: ""There's a distinct risk that if this carries on as it is unabated, the hoteliers will say to us either 'We don't want to work with the British market at all' or 'We're not going to offer you all-inclusive'. ""I think that would be a terrible thing for the British customer. It's just going to reduce the choice in terms of destinations and the type of holiday."" All-inclusive breaks have become more popular since the Brexit vote as they keep a lid on in-resort spending - made more expensive for UK tourists by the collapse in the value of the pound. The travel trade organisation Abta says a legal loophole it is seeking to close is encouraging lawyers to sign up people to claim they were ill even if they were not. It argues recent laws aimed at curbing fraudulent whiplash claims by capping legal fees has pushed CMCs towards the travel industry, as the legislation does not apply to incidents abroad. Holidaymakers making claims are also being warned that bogus claimants risk legal action in return. One well-publicised case involves a British couple said to be at risk of losing their home after a Greek resort hotel brought a £170,000 counter claim against them after making a food poisoning allegation that was later withdrawn. Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said of its Stop Sickness Scams campaign: ""The Government must urgently address this issue. ""The legal loophole that is allowing firms to unduly profit from these claims must be closed. ""This would allow people with genuine claims access to justice but make this area less attractive to claims firms."" Sky News has contacted the CMC industry's trade body for a response."

He said some had clung to banisters to feel their way down 20 flights of stairs in acrid smoke. Twelve patients were admitted to the south London hospital immediately after the fire on Wednesday morning. Seven are still receiving treatment. Mr Bew said his colleagues were expecting to receive hundreds of patients on the night of the blaze. ""As time went on and we realised that we weren't going to receive those casualties, it was very sad,"" he said. ""The people at the scene had stayed in their flats because that's what they were told to do, but the flames were coming up the external panels, to their windows and to their homes."" Some survivors may take weeks and months to recover from physical injuries, Mr Bew said, but he believes the psychological impact of the disaster may take even longer to get over. Mr Bew said he believed some of his patients went back into the building to save other families after escaping with their own. ""People went into the stairwells and went into toxic smoke,"" he said. ""Some of them went down 20 flights of stairs. There was this intense heat and they were feeling their way down banisters. ""I think people who escaped felt that they were going to die and that the only way to stay alive was to go through the smoke."" At least 79 people are confirmed dead or missing, presumed dead after the disaster, although the number is expected to rise. Only five victims have been formally identified."

Detectives have been given extra time to question the 47-year-old, who has been arrested oh suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism including murder and attempted murder. Osborne is said to have been asked to leave the Hollybush pub in the Welsh capital on Saturday night. Pub regular Phil Henry said: ""He was kicked out of here, the landlord said, for shouting about Islam. He was asked to leave quietly and he went. ""He came in here and he was just staring before he started shouting. ""When he came in the landlord said he was on his own and started shouting 'I'll kill every f****** Muslim'."" Edward Gardiner, one of Osborne's neighbours, said he called police at 12.27am on Sunday to report his concerns for the welfare of a man sitting in a Pontyclun Van Hire vehicle. A similar vehicle was seen near to where one man died and eleven were injured in Finsbury Park, an incident police are treating as a suspected terror attack. Mr Gardiner said: ""I called police because I saw a random van in my cul-de-sac with someone drunk in it and the door open. ""I could smell alcohol on him and he was grunting and groaning. I poked him but he didn't respond so I called 101. ""It was a Pontyclun Van Hire van. They said they would sort it out. They didn't give me a crime reference number, I don't know if they came out. He added: ""I didn't think anything about it but then I saw the news reports and it was the same guy, the same van."" Osborne was born in Singapore but grew up in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where he attended Broadoak Mathematics and Computing College. He moved to a semi-detached house on an estate in Glyn Rhosyn, Pentwyn, east Cardiff, with his partner, who works as a pub chef, and their children, aged between five and 16. Police have been searching an address in the area. The couple are said to have had a turbulent relationship, with Osborne living in a tent in woodland in recent months. But Osborne, reported to be an unemployed former barman, would regularly see his children. Osborne's nephew Ellis Osborne said his uncle is ""not a racist"" and had never expressed any racist views. In a statement on behalf of the family, Ellis, 26, said: ""We are massively shocked; it's unbelievable, it still hasn't really sunk in. ""We are devastated for the families, our hearts go out to the people who have been injured."" He added: ""It's madness. It is obviously sheer madness."" Osborne's mother Christine, 72, said she was living ""every mother's worst nightmare"" and screamed when she saw her son on TV. She told The Sun: ""My son is no terrorist - he's just a man with problems and I don't know how to cope with all this."" The worshippers had been at the Muslim Welfare House in Finsbury Park after praying during the holy month of Ramadan. Witnesses said they heard the van driver, who was detained by members of the public at the scene, shout: ""I'm going to kill Muslims."" Police said the attack happened while a man, who later died, was receiving first aid after being taken ill. Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the Muslim Welfare House, said two victims remain in hospital with one in a coma. Nine others are recovering at home while the man who died was conscious when the incident took place, despite earlier suggestions, said Mr Kacimi. Police have not made it clear whether there is any link between the death and the attack. A warrant for further detention for detectives to question Osborne has been authorised until just before 1am on Saturday."

The phrase was one of the key planks of Theresa May's Lancaster House Brexit speech and the strategy of David Davis' Department for Exiting the European Union. It was also mentioned in the Conservative manifesto. One former minister told Sky News that ""no deal is now dead"", and anticipated a transition phase of five to 10 years inside the European Economic Area. The MPs are pointing to disappointing Conservative election results in London, Birmingham and big cities across the M4 corridor, and among the under-45s, as a reason for a rethink. :: Hammond warns: We must avoid Brexit 'cliff edge' Another Conservative MP said Tory centrists from the 2015 intake were now organised in a WhatsApp grouping and behind the push to ensure the Prime Minister is not overly influenced by the Brexiteer grouping the European Research Group (ERG). Its leader, Steve Baker, was recently appointed by the Prime Minister to become a junior minister in the Brexit Department. Some ERG MPs have indicated that they would be willing to support an immediate leadership challenge should the PM ""soften"" her approach to Brexit. Longstanding Brexiteer MPs such as Sir Bill Cash believe that it is impossible to delay or reverse the Article 50 process now that it has been triggered, and that Britain will leave the EU on March 2019, with or without a deal. But there are easily enough Conservative MPs who want the Prime Minister to rule out a ""No Deal"" for a cross-party majority in the House of Commons. Chancellor Philip Hammond was aware of the MPs' views when he said that ""no deal would be a very very bad outcome"". Government sources say Mrs May has already stressed that she wants and expects an exit deal with the European Union. Number 10 has toned down its language on the issue since the election, stressing only that they would not endorse a deal worse than no deal, a deliberate attempt to punish the UK by the EU."

""One lady I had met ran from the fire wearing no more than a t-shirt and a pair of knickers. She had lost absolutely everything."" The Prime Minister continued: ""So let me be absolutely clear. The support on the ground for families in the initial hours was not good enough. ""People were left without belongings, without roofs over their heads, without even basic information about what had happened, what they should do, and where they could seek help. ""That was a failure of the state, local and national, to help people when they needed it most. As Prime Minister, I apologise for that failure."" Mrs May said that all those who have lost their homes will be rehoused within three weeks. As part of its efforts, the Government has purchased apartments at an upmarket development. And the Prime Minister said there would be a ""new strategy for resilience in major disasters, which could include a new civil disaster response task force"".

New Mexico police chief Pete Kassetas believes a body recovered at the weekend is that of Colorado pastor Paris Wallace, who disappeared last week while searching for the treasure along the Rio Grande. He wants Mr Fenn to end the ""nonsense"" before someone else dies. ""He's putting lives at risk,"" said Mr Kassetas. ""It can be avoided. People are coming from other states and other parts of the world to find this elusive treasure that may or may not exist with very few clues and they are underestimating New Mexico,"" he told KRQE News 13. The police chief said other treasure hunters had got into trouble and had been rescued. Mr Wallace's wife Mitzi reported her husband missing on 14 June and following an extensive search of the pastor's belongings in his hotel room, and the trails and woodland in the Espanola area, his car was eventually found along the river. Rescuers spotted a body downstream - about seven miles from where the 52-year-old was last believed to have been. It is yet to be formally identified but authorities believe it is that of Mr Wallace. His wife said she and her 19-year-old son would continue to hunt for the loot. ""Our treasure is that time we spend together,"" she said. Mrs Wallace said her husband put himself in a dangerous situation that cost him his life, but added: ""I know without a shadow of a doubt that it was God's way of taking him."" Linda Bilyeu's 54-year-old ex-husband Randy Bilyeu, also from Colorado, disappeared last January while looking for the treasure along the Rio Grande. His remains were found several months later. She is among those calling for Fenn to end the quest. ""Another family is left to grieve and carry on without their loved ones,"" she said. ""Only one man has the power to stop the madness. Yet he continues to pretend he's doing a good deed by getting people off the couch and into nature."" New Mexico Search & Rescue has posted a survey on its Facebook page asking the public if they think Fenn should call off the search - and it has attracted a mixed reaction. One person wrote: ""Let those who want to experience nature's beauty continue to do so in the thrill of the chase."" However, another responded: ""Make Fenn prove the treasure even exists and then decide. I believe there is no treasure."" Describing Mr Wallace's disappearance as tragic, Mr Fenn told the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper that he has been considering how to make the quest safer, as well as stopping it altogether, but has not yet decided what to do."

2017-06-21,Sky News has been shown a new recycling method which could lead to thousands of tons of waste currently going to landfill being reused.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170621173129/http://news.sky.com/story/ocean-rescue-new-recycling-method-could-prevent-tons-of-waste-10922117,"A plant near Huntington in Cambridgeshire has begun commercial operations to recycle plastic aluminium laminate, which is increasingly used by manufacturers to package food, drinks, cosmetics and pet food, but is not currently recycled by councils in the UK. Although the light, flexible material is cheap and environmentally friendly to produce and transport, it contains a mixture of plastic and metal that makes it difficult to recycle. Despite successful trials involving three councils, so far no councils or waste handlers are using the new technology and the material is not collected as part of household recycling. The company behind the new recycling technology, Enval, estimates 160,000 tons of plastic aluminium laminate packaging is used in the UK each year. The company's CEO, Carlos Ludlow-Palafox, told Sky News: ""With the recycling process that we are carrying out we will prevent thousands of tons of material from going to landfill. ""More importantly, we can recover the aluminium that is embedded in the plastic aluminium laminates. Aluminium is one of the most energy intensive products to produce... so if you already have the aluminium, the last thing you want is to send it back to landfill."" The process involves using a large microwave oven heated to 600 degrees. The material is broken down then fed into the microwave where the heat breaks the plastic into a gas, freeing the aluminium which remains undamaged. Some of the gas produced is used to power the plant, the rest is cooled to create oil which is then sold on. Allison Ogden-Newton from Keep Britain Tidy told Sky News it comes down to money and the arrangements councils have with waste providers. She said: ""The difficulty we've got is with new technologies - putting them into place with the existing contracts. So essentially it comes back to a cost issue. ""They have longstanding contracts with existing providers. When those contracts are up for review, that's the time to introduce these new technologies."" Ms Ogden-Newton believes the focus should be on encouraging manufacturers to use more easily recyclable materials. ""Anything that's being produced as packaging we would like people to think about how it's going to be recycled and make that process as simple as possible,"" she said. ""For instance, using tactics like having a single element to the packaging so plastic can be easily recycled, having the same grade of plastic throughout the product, or using cardboard. ""Frankly, the people who have the most control are the consumers. Consumers do, we know, care passionately about recycling. They don't want to see things going to landfill. ""So on that basis I think if manufacturers are thinking about that, and thinking about how they're actually producing stuff that people actually want to buy, then they need their packaging to be of the sort that can be recycled.""

Meanwhile, Airbnb has called on its London hosts to open their homes for free to Red Cross staff and volunteers who have been supporting those affected by the fire."

Rodong Sinmun claimed Donald Trump was considering a pre-emptive strike on North Korea in order to divert attention from a political crisis in the US and said the president was in a ""tough situation"" at home. ""South Korea must realise that following psychopath Trump...will only lead to disaster,"" the newspaper wrote. South Korean president Moon Jae-in is due to visit Washington next week to meet President Trump and told US media he wanted to begin talks with North Korea on its nuclear programme by the end of the year. He called the leaders in Pyongyang an ""irrational regime"" in an interview with CBS television's This Morning. Tensions between the US and North Korea have shown no signs of abating, with Mr Trump condemning the country for frequently flexing its military muscles. The death of Mr Warmbier, who was jailed for 15 years with hard labour in 2016 for trying to steal a propaganda sign, prompted Mr Trump to condemn the ""brutality of the North Korean regime"". ""Otto's fate deepens my administration's determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency,"" he said. A memorial service will be held for the 22-year-old student at Wyoming High School in Ohio on Thursday as the coroner continues to try to determine the cause of his death."
2017-06-22,More than 120 supercars were seized as authorities dismantled an elaborate tax avoidance scam in Britain and Thailand.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170622175028/http://news.sky.com/story/stolen-british-supercars-shipped-to-thailand-in-tax-scam-10923541,"Dozens of luxury vehicles including Lamborghinis, Porsches and BMWs were stolen from British streets as part of the scam. It used a range of complex methods to bypass the hefty taxes levied on supercars imported into Thailand, which usually stand at around 328%. One tactic for avoiding the taxes involved dismantling cars, shipping them from the UK in parts and reassembling them in Thailand. Other scammers simply lied to customs officials about what kind of car was being imported. Eight Lamborghini Aventadors were declared to be cheaper Gallardo models, and customs officials either failed to notice or deliberately ignored the obvious discrepancy. The most common method, however, involved simply understating the value of a car, often by many thousands of pounds, at customs. Around 30 businesses are being investigated in the operation against the scam and a series of raids have been conducted in recent weeks. ""More than 1,000 supercars are implicated in the undervaluing scam,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Korawat Panprapakorn, who is leading the operation with Thailand's Department for Special Investigations. ""This practice has been going on for a long time."" The scam was uncovered when owners in the UK reported their cars stolen, and British authorities requested that Thailand help recover the vehicles. Authorities estimated that 38 stolen vehicles have been taken from the UK to Thailand, with a total value of some £2.3 million. Seven cars - two Lamborghinis, two BMW M4s, two Porsche Boxters and a Nissan GTR- have been seized at a used car dealership in Bangkok. The owner of the dealership, Indharasak Techaterasiri, denied allegations that he had under-valued the cars in his showroom, claiming that the fault lies with customs officials. Mr Techaterasiri, who goes by the nickname ""Unity Boy"", has filed to sue the DSI after officers closed down his showroom. Police arrested him on fraud charges after wealthy customers complained that the cars they had purchased may now be illegal. ""They keep saying on the news that all these cars are stolen, that I am a criminal,"" Techaterasiri, who imports 500-600 cars from the UK every year, said. ""It isn't fair for me."" The scandal uncovers the hidden workings of an extreme luxury market in Thailand, where an economic slump has not slowed the extravagances of a billionaire class. Supercars can often be seen on Bangkok's gridlocked streets. Britain is the favourite source for luxury imports as both countries drive on the left hand side of the road."
2017-06-22,Insulation boards fitted to the outside of Grenfell Tower gave off highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas which may have contributed to the deaths of some of the 79 confirmed victims.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170622175028/http://news.sky.com/story/toxic-gases-released-during-grenfell-tower-fire-may-have-caused-some-deaths-10922685,"Fire toxicity experts have told Sky News the insulation boards installed during a refurbishment of the tower produce the deadly gas when they burn, and their positioning meant every flat could have been filled with enough gas to kill those inside. At least three of those injured in the fire have been treated with an antidote for hydrogen cyanide poisoning in hospital, and the number of those affected may be higher. The gas could have incapacitated some residents, but establishing its role in the cause of death may be impossible because of the condition of the victims. King's College Hospital confirmed to Sky News that three of the 12 patients it received from the fire were treated with the hydrogen cyanide antidote Cyanokit. Four other hospital trusts declined to comment on the treatment administered to those injured in the fire. An initial 68 patients were taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 receiving critical care and some put into induced comas to aid in the recovery of damaged airways. As of Wednesday morning, 10 people were still being treated in four hospitals, six of them in critical care. The insulation used at Grenfell Tower was made of Polyisocyanurate (PIR), rigid plastic foam sandwiched between two sheets of aluminium foil that supplied in 15cm-thick boards. The PIR itself is flammable, but the aluminium foil is intended to disperse flames and prevent it catching fire. The boards were fitted against the exterior wall of Grenfell Tower, behind the cladding that was installed to improve the appearance of the building. Richard Hull, professor of chemistry and fire science at the University of Central Lancashire, told Sky News that the gas produced by the insulation when it burned may have been deadly. ""The outside wall of the building had 150mm of PIR foam (fitted), and once the fire had spread to that every flat would have its own source of PIR foam, which would have produced enough hydrogen cyanide to kill all the people in that flat,"" he said. Professor Hull co-authored a peer-reviewed study in 2011 into the fire toxicity of six insulation materials which was published in the Energy & Building journal. The study established that PIR was the most toxic. The report also warned that while modern, lightweight building materials are cheaper to produce and offer improved thermal insulation, they pose a greater risk than traditional materials in the event of fire. Professor Hull said the warnings in his report should have been heeded. ""It's been an accident waiting to happen and unfortunately we've got to the stage now where the accident has happened and we're standing here saying 'I told you so'. ""It would have been much better if people had listened to us earlier on when we published the report."" The insulation board was manufactured by Celotex, who say that if fitted correctly it is the first PIR insulation board that can meet regulations for use on buildings above 18m (59ft) tall. When contacted for comment, Celotex referred Sky News to a statement on its website published last Friday. It said: ""As with the rest of the nation our thoughts continue to be with those affected by the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower in London. ""On Wednesday, as soon as we were able to, we confirmed that our records showed a Celotex product (RS5000) was purchased for use in refurbishing the building. ""This product has a fire rating classification of Class 0, in accordance with British Standards. ""We will of course assist the relevant authorities fully with any enquiries they have."""

It is calling on the Prime Minister to provide clarification on the inquiry's scope and terms of reference. So far 79 people have been confirmed dead in the disaster although that number is expected to rise. In the letter shown to Sky News, the FBU says firefighters want justice for the victims and families, saying its members responded to the incident with ""great courage and professionalism"". The union also raises concerns about fire safety regulations. ""Current building regulations in England are ambiguous about fire safety matters on cladding, and inadequate on sprinklers,"" it says. ""Fire risk assessors do not have to be properly qualified. The fire and rescue service no longer enforces fire safety to the same extent it did in the past."" The letter goes on to say: ""The FBU believes the public inquiry will fail the victims of the Grenfell fire and betray communities across the UK if it does not address the critical matter of fire safety protection for every home and every workplace. ""That cannot be allowed to happen."" It has been reported by the Government that the cladding used in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower was banned in the UK. The FBU claims there has also been a fall in the number of fire safety inspections in people's homes over recent years, blaming budget cuts. ""Home fire safety checks in England have fallen by 25% according to Home Office figures, whether measured by the number of visits or the hours spent on these checks,"" it said. ""This is not about targeting vulnerable people, which is the common excuse given for the decline - there are fewer firefighters available to carry out this irreplaceable, life-saving work."" The Home Office told Sky News: ""Government and fire authorities invest significantly in fire prevention and the total number of fires attended has fallen by half over the last 10 years."" According to the FBU, more than 11,000 front-line firefighter jobs have been lost across the UK since 2010."

I don't think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time."" He also hinted at a lingering resentment about what he was asked to do at his mother Princess Diana's funeral in 1997, when he was just 12. ""My mother had just died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television,"" he said. ""I don't think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances. I don't think it would happen today."" Harry revealed in April that he had sought help after he ""shut down"" his emotions following Princess Diana's death in a road accident in 1997. Regarding Diana's legacy, he said: ""I intuitively know what my mother would like me to do and want to progress with work she couldn't complete."" When she was photographed shaking hands with a HIV-positive man in 1987, the notion that HIV/Aids might be passed on through touch was challenged. In December, Harry was photographed having an HIV test in Barbados. He said his mother ""had the most wonderful sense of humour and always wanted to make things fun for us, as well as protect us"". Diana also ""took a huge part in showing me an ordinary life"". ""People would be amazed by the ordinary life William and I live,"" Harry said. ""I do my own shopping. Even if I was King, I would do my own shopping."" But could things become too ordinary, removing the Royal Family's mystery? ""It's a tricky balancing act,"" he said. ""We don't want to dilute the magic. The British public and the whole world need institutions like it."" Harry had lots of praise for the Queen, saying: ""She is so remarkable."" ""The monarchy is a force for good,"" he said, ""and we (Harry, William and Kate) want to carry on the positive atmosphere that the Queen has achieved for over 60 years, but we won't be trying to fill her boots. ""We are involved in modernising the British monarchy. We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people."" Concerning which roles he, William and Kate take on, Harry said the Queen ""has been fantastic in letting us choose"". He added: ""She tells us to take our time and really think things through."""

A statement from the commander of the Mosul offensive, Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir Yarallah, said the explosion took place as Iraqi forces, which have been advancing in the Old City, were within 50 metres of the building. ""The Daesh (Islamic State) terror gangs committed another historical crime by blowing up the al Nouri mosque and its historical al-Hadba minaret,"" the statement said. The medieval mosque, also known as Mosul's Great Mosque, is where IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi declared a so-called Islamic caliphate in 2014. It was seen as a key symbolic prize in the fight for Mosul. The minaret stood for more than 840 years. IS has blamed a US strike for the mosque's destruction. Sky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay in Erbil, Iraq, said: ""We spoke to a senior commander who was on the ground and he said it was an explosion on the ground, not an airstrike. ""He said there is a huge amount of fighting taking place around the mosque right now."" ""The first pictures we've seen would suggest that it is almost completely destroyed and the famous minaret has gone."" Iraqi forces this week launched a push into Mosul's Old City, where the last IS fighters are holed up with an estimated 100,000 civilians, according to the UN. The fight to retake Mosul was launched more than eight months ago and has displaced some 850,000 people."

The 51-year-old father of four from Haringey, north London, died at the scene. Nine people were taken to hospital after the attack. Two of the four people still receiving care are in a critical condition. Detectives continue to question attack suspect Darren Osborne, 47. Mr Ali, who moved to the UK from Bangladesh when he was 10, was described by his family as a ""peace-loving and gentle person who had no enemies"". In a statement, they said: ""We are devastated by the loss of a husband, father, brother and grandfather in this tragic event. ""Our father was a quiet gentle man, he didn't get involved in political or social discussion, he instead took comfort and enjoyment spending time with his wife, children and grandchildren and he was always ready to make a funny joke when you least expected."" Mr Ali's family said they have ""always believed that the actions of one person cannot be a reflection of a whole people"", adding that the 51-year-old ""would urge people to remain calm and to pray for peace"". Police issued a photo of the van used in the attack - registration plate number PO54 CSF - and urged anyone who spoke to the driver to come forward. Detectives have trawled through around 80 hours of CCTV, visited 140 locations and recovered 33 digital devices from a number of addresses in Wales. Met Police deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu said counter-terror officers have also interviewed 28 witnesses who were at the scene. He said: ""We are very grateful to everyone who has provided information so far - their accounts are assisting the investigation hugely - but we need more people to come forward and tell us what they saw and what they know about the driver of this van.

2017-06-22,"A ""British problem"" of false food poisoning claims means hoteliers abroad could bar UK holidaymakers from their resorts, according to the travel industry.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170622175028/http://news.sky.com/story/brits-face-ban-from-all-inclusive-holidays-over-fake-poisoning-claims-10921834,"Holiday firms have reported a surge in legal action - mostly involving claims management companies (CMCs) representing all-inclusive holiday customers. Such holidaymakers are often targeted by touts working for so-called ambulance chasers, the industry claims, who use the fact all meals are eaten at the same hotel to bolster their case - winning thousands of pounds. TUI, which owns the Thomson and First Choice holiday brands, said that since spring 2016 it had recorded 15 times more sickness claims than in previous years, despite reported sickness levels remaining stable. The company's UK managing director said it had caused ""friction"" with hotel owners. Nick Longman told the Press Association: ""There's a distinct risk that if this carries on as it is unabated, the hoteliers will say to us either 'We don't want to work with the British market at all' or 'We're not going to offer you all-inclusive'. ""I think that would be a terrible thing for the British customer. It's just going to reduce the choice in terms of destinations and the type of holiday."" All-inclusive breaks have become more popular since the Brexit vote as they keep a lid on in-resort spending - made more expensive for UK tourists by the collapse in the value of the pound. The travel trade organisation Abta says a legal loophole it is seeking to close is encouraging lawyers to sign up people to claim they were ill even if they were not. It argues recent laws aimed at curbing fraudulent whiplash claims by capping legal fees has pushed CMCs towards the travel industry, as the legislation does not apply to incidents abroad. Holidaymakers making claims are also being warned that bogus claimants risk legal action in return. One well-publicised case involves a British couple said to be at risk of losing their home after a Greek resort hotel brought a £170,000 counter claim against them after making a food poisoning allegation that was later withdrawn. Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said of its Stop Sickness Scams campaign: ""The Government must urgently address this issue. ""The legal loophole that is allowing firms to unduly profit from these claims must be closed. ""This would allow people with genuine claims access to justice but make this area less attractive to claims firms."" Sky News has contacted the CMC industry's trade body for a response."

""What we are asking for is recognition by the Government that after 30 years of a very violent conflict in Northern Ireland when the capital resources were spent on security - on police stations, fortifications, military establishments - our infrastructure fell well behind the rest of the United Kingdom. So what we are asking for is some help to make up that deficit."" Sir Jeffrey hinted the DUP had already secured concessions from the Tories, with the Prime Minister's pledges to end the triple lock for pensioners and means testing for the winter fuel allowance being left out of the Queen's Speech. ""We are interested in a deal that benefits the UK as a whole,"" he said. ""What we certainly don't want to see is pensioners and the more vulnerable being affected. If what we do benefits people across the United Kingdom then as a unionist party that is something we are proud of."" Asked about the chances of a deal before next week's key Commons vote on the Queen's Speech, Sir Jeffrey said: ""I think very good. The sooner the better as far as we are concerned."" Earlier this week, Sky sources said the negotiations ""haven't proceeded in a way that DUP would have expected"", with the DUP urging the Government to give the talks ""greater focus"". But Sir Jeffrey indicated that the situation had improved since the talks began after Mrs May became more personally involved, with initial discussions being led by Government Chief Whip Gavin Williamson. ""I think the Prime Minister is moving this process forward. She is engaged now. We welcome that. I think that since that has happened we have been moving forward,"" he said. Chancellor Philip Hammond also expressed confidence that an agreement would be reached. ""We don't agree on everything, but on the big issues about the Union, about the need to grow our economy and to spread the benefits of that growth across all corners of the United Kingdom, on the need to be strong on defence and counter-terrorism - on all of these areas we agree with the Democratic Unionist Party and I am confident that we will be able to come to an arrangement with them to support the Government in the key areas of its programme,"" he told the BBC."

At the time, Apple was its largest customer - accounting for around half its annual revenue - and a major shareholder. It prompted the Hertfordshire-based company to launch a dispute resolution procedure under its licence agreement with Apple to seek new licencing terms and royalties in a bid to avoid the prospect of a costly intellectual property battle in the courts. It later announced it was looking to sell its MIPS and Ensigma operations - focused on embedded processors and connectivity respectively. News of the group sale helped Imagination shares rally 19% on opening. The company said: ""Imagination Technologies Group announces that over the last few weeks it has received interest from a number of parties for a potential acquisition of the whole group. ""The board of Imagination has therefore decided to initiate a formal sale process for the group and is engaged in preliminary discussions with potential bidders. ""The sale process for the MIPS and Ensigma operations, which commenced on 4 May 2017, is progressing well and indicative proposals have been received for both businesses."" Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said buyers were keen as Imagination's shares remained 60% down on where they were before the Apple row ahead of the market opening. He added: ""It was never going to be easy for Imagination Technologies when it lost its biggest customer and efforts to offload two of its three main businesses - MIPS and Ensigma - in a bid to strengthen the balance sheet clearly weren't enough. ""These were both strong potential growth areas that could have delivered lasting revenue accretion to offset the loss of Apple. ""That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer. ""Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought.

The pay vote being put to ASLEF members follows the failure of months of talks, which could result in driver strikes from 27 July - the start of the school holidays. Southern said its offer amounted to a rise of almost 24% over four years. It threatened to withdraw the offer - reported to take a driver's basic salary above £60,000 - if the overtime ban went ahead on the issue of driver-only operation. A spokesman said: ""People will be amazed the Aslef leadership has rejected such a significant pay offer for their members, especially as they have twice before accepted the extension of driver-controlled operation which has now been in place for over six months."" He added: ""This ballot is a real chance for drivers to end this dispute by showing they want to accept the 23.8% pay offer and work with us to modernise the congested Southern network as updated infrastructure, trains and working practices provide the service passengers need and deserve."" ASLEF's general secretary, Mick Whelan, has previously called for Southern's owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), to be stripped of the franchise for Southern's ""failure"" to deliver services. He said on Thursday: ""We have been talking to the company over the last fortnight in parallel, but separate, talks about drivers' terms and conditions; industrial relations and pay. ""The company's failure to engage over driver-only operation is the reason our members will no longer work overtime - which, of course, is entirely voluntary - from 29 June."" News of the fresh strike ballot emerged shortly after GTR's parent firm used its latest results to warn Southern passengers of the risk of fresh disruption from the threatened driver overtime ban. It said GTR passenger revenues for the year to 1 July were expected to fall by around 4% - in line with a 4% decline in passenger journeys. The announcements coincided with the publication of a report by the Network Rail director Chris Gibb on the company's performance. It concluded: ""On Southern, all elements of the system have been under strain: unreliable infrastructure, a timetable that is very tight and with overcrowded peak services, some key stations that are overcrowded, depots that are full and for historic reasons are in the wrong place, and people involved in informal and formal industrial action. ""The system cannot possibly work to passengers' satisfaction with these components in this state."""

Details of at-risk structures will be revealed after residents are informed, the Department for Communities and Local Government says. Cladding on the outside of Grenfell Tower is suspected to have hastened the spread of the blaze which killed at least 79 people. Local authorities and fire services are ""taking all possible steps"" to ensure buildings with combustible panels are safe, the Prime Minister said. The Government is performing tests on 100 tower blocks a day, with results coming back ""within hours"", she added. :: Tower fire released deadly hydrogen cyanide Urging building owners to send samples for testing, Mrs May said: ""Landlords have a legal obligation to provide safe buildings and where they cannot do that we expect alternative accommodation to be provided."" Making a statement to the Commons, Mrs May said ""no stone will be left unturned"" and that the chair of the inquiry into the disaster will produce an interim report ""as soon as possible"". Former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said the results of cladding tests were ""chilling"" and called on the Prime Minister to ""get a grip on this personally"". The Grenfell Tower disaster would have been avoided if the Government had acted on the findings of an inquest into the deaths of six people in the 2009 Lakanal House fire, Ms Harman added. Meanwhile, Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad told Mrs May residents in her constituency had been left ""traumatised and frightened"" after the Grenfell Tower fire. Earlier, the chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council resigned following criticism of the authority's reaction to the tragedy. :: Grenfell Tower residents promised fire-resistant cladding in 2012 Nicholas Holgate said the Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid had ""required the leader of the council to seek my resignation"". Amid questions over fire safety provisions at Grenfell Tower, the union representing firefighters who tackled the blaze told Sky News it has ""major concerns"" over building regulations in England. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has sent a letter to MPs insisting it is named as a core participant in the public inquiry. It says: ""Current building regulations in England are ambiguous about fire safety matters on cladding, and inadequate on sprinklers."" ""The FBU believes the public inquiry will fail the victims of the Grenfell fire and betray communities across the UK if it does not address the critical matter of fire safety protection for every home and every workplace. ""That cannot be allowed to happen."""

It predicted demand for staff among farmers would grow as the industry, currently worth £1.2bn annually, expands but warned that growers were already being hit by staff shortages following the referendum. The body said a fixed-term contract Seasonal Agriculture Permit Scheme would allow labourers from Europe to enter the UK ""to fill the jobs UK citizens shun"" if freedom of movement ends. Laurence Olins, British Summer Fruits chairman, said: ""This is as extreme as it gets. If we do not have the pickers, we do not have a soft fruit industry. ""It is inconceivable that people who voted to leave the European Union wanted to destroy an iconic and incredibly competitive British horticulture industry, and see the end of buying British produce. ""But if we cannot ensure access to the seasonal workers needed to produce soft fruit in Britain, that will be an unintended consequence of Brexit - along with soaring prices and increased reliance on imports."" It warned the Treasury would feel the impact too - with income tax, corporation tax and National Insurance revenues all falling. A grower, Harry Hall of Hall Hunter Partnership, said stopping the flow of migrant labour would be ""an unfathomable and astonishing form of national self-harm"". The Government has previously admitted that there are sections of the economy at risk of employment shortages after Brexit. It is examining options, ahead of talks with Brussels, on future arrangements. The Home Office said in April it was looking at plans for ""barista visas"" to ensure coffee shops and pubs are fully staffed."

And she will have to deal with the fallout of the van attack near the Finsbury Park mosque, which she said is being treated ""as a potential terrorist attack"". In her inbox this week - a major speech on Wednesday at the start of the Queen's Speech, where she will set out her legislative programme for the next two years.MPs won't actually vote on it until 28 June, but her benches will be watching her closely - every performance a test of her mettle after her faltering response to the Grenfell Tower disaster last week.There is also the matter of the DUP confidence-and-supply deal that still needs to be nailed down. No 10 are confident that the Unionists will vote with Mrs May, giving her an expected majority of around 13 - but she has yet to reach agreement.That deal is complicated by the wider politics of Northern Ireland, amid concerns that the deal with the DUP could hamper efforts to re-establish the stalled power-sharing executive at Stormont: to that end, the Prime Minister will on Monday meet the new Irish PM Leo Varadkar in Downing Street.""We will discuss Northern Ireland and the need to re-establish devolved Government, and Brexit, focusing on how we can avoid any adverse impact on the rights and freedoms of our citizens, on trade and the economy,"" Mr Varadkar said ahead of his bilateral meeting. Then, of course, is the start of Brexit talks, the Tories' fragile peace holding over the weekend after her Chancellor confirmed that there would be no rowing back on the promise to leave the single market and customs union. But those tensions will no doubt rise once more when the tussles over Britain's EU exit bill and the future deal begin in earnest. :: Labour claims Brexit 'disarray' on eve of talks in BrusselsHer MPs are in no doubt of her shortcomings - revealed in full technicolour during the election campaign, and then again last week when she initially failed to meet survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. ""Everyone knows she's not Mrs Emotional in public,"" said one minister, adding that they thought she had the support of most of her party still.But the stories about whether it's time for Mrs May to go - and who might replace her - won't dissipate. There are suggestions that once leader contender David Davis might be put up as a caretaker Prime Minister, rather as Michael Howard was back in 2004. There's talk of a ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge if she waters down Brexit - though there is no sign so far that she intends to do that.Another senior party figure said allies of Boris Johnson were taking soundings from colleagues, which was playing quite badly with some MPs who are adamant that further Tory infighting would play badly with the public. ""She's the only show in town,"" said the MP. ""The public don't want to see us knifing each other.""Mr Johnson's team insist any suggestion he's on manoeuvres is ""completely false"". ""Boris is supporting the Prime Minister and anyone doing this sort of thing is not acting with his knowledge or support,"" they say.While some in the party believe the Prime Minister is now a busted flush, opinion seems to be coalescing around the view that now is not the right time to change leader. As Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, put it on Sunday: ""I think what the country needs now is a period of calm while we get on with the job in hand. ""We've got one very serious issues to address, including the Brexit negotiations just starting. Theresa is leading the Government and I think the Government needs to get on with its job. ""And do you know what? I think actually that's what most people in this country will think - that the Government just needs to get on with the day job of Government.""Getting on with the job has become her new mantra as grand designs give way to hand-to-mouth survival. How long she stays in No 10 depends on her party, but for most MPs her continued leadership remains the least worst option - for now."

Mr Underhill, a senior manager for the Al Khayat Investment Group, died before rescuers could reach him.

Taking credit for the concept, Mr Trump said: ""Pretty good imagination, right? My idea!"" Despite the President's claim, a construction proposal submitted to the Department of Homeland Security in April included solar panels which would provide electricity for lighting, sensors and patrol stations along the wall. Thomas Gleason, who submitted the pitch, said power could be sold to Mexico and solar panels would ensure the wall could ""pay for itself"". Talking up the idea, Mr Trump said: ""Yes, we will build a wall. We have to stop the drugs from flowing in. ""I will give you an idea that nobody has heard about yet. The southern border. ""Lots of sun, lots of heat. We are thinking about building a wall as a solar wall."" He added: ""This way, Mexico will have to pay much less money. And that's good. Right?"" ""Think of it, the higher it goes, the more valuable it is."" During the Presidential campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly insisted he would force Mexico to pay for the wall estimated to cost around $21.6bn (£17bn). He later appeared to row back on the pledge, saying US taxpayers would foot the bill until ""we will be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico"". In January, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto made a televised address in which he said he ""lamented"" plans for the barrier and reiterated his country would not pay a single peso. So far the US Congress has not committed funding to the project, agreeing only to finance maintenance on existing parts of the border fence.

""Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed, and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. I told them that in fact the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows?"" Mr Tusk said. ""You may say I'm a dreamer, but I am not the only one."" he added, borrowing the chorus from Lennon's Imagine. :: EU citizens' rights on the table at summit The result of the UK General Election has reignited the Brexit debate with questions over the type of Brexit Britain wants. ""As we know, the Brexit negotiations started three days ago. It is a most difficult process, for which the EU is well prepared. We can hear different predictions, coming from different people, about the possible outcome of these negotiations: hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal,"" Mr Tusk said. European leaders are watching British politics closely as negotiations for Britain's EU withdrawal begin. Speculation that a leadership challenge to Mrs May is possible raises questions about her authority and the certainty of the sort of Brexit she is proposing. :: Brexit negotiations begin: What does each side want? In an interview ahead of the summit with a group of European newspapers, new French President Emmanuel Macron pledged ""pragmatism and cooperation"" with post-Brexit Britain. ""Pragmatism will determine our new relationship"" he said, adding that working together on defence and counter-terrorism was vital because the UK and France have 'linked destinies'. Asked to elaborate on comments he made last week about the prospect of Britain deciding against Brexit, he said: ""The door is open until the moment you walk through it. It's not up to me to say it's closed. ""But from the moment things are engaged with a timescale and an objective, it's very hard to go back, we can't lie to ourselves."" Mrs May arrived at the summit not with the large majority and strong mandate she had hoped he election would give her but instead in a much diminished position. Her European counterparts can't guarantee that she will be the UK leader in a few months, let alone that she will see the Brexit deal through. Speaking as she arrived at the summit, Mrs May said there had been a ""constructive"" start to the Brexit talks. ""We will be going into negotiations. Those have started constructively,"" she told reporters. ""What I am going to be setting out today is clearly how the United Kingdom proposes to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and see the rights of UK citizens living in Europe protected. ""That's been an important issue. We've wanted it to be one of the early issues to be considered in the negotiations That is now the case. That work is starting."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said building a future for the remaining member states took precedence over the Brexit talks. ""I want to say clearly that, for me, shaping the future for the 27 takes priority over the negotiations with Great Britain over withdrawal,"" she said. ""Naturally we will conduct these negotiations quickly and we will conduct them intensively. We will do everything to ensure that - as has been successfully done so far - the 27 states stick together. ""We want this negotiation to take place in a good spirit. We know that we will want to work with Great Britain later. But the clear focus must be on the future of the 27, so that we have the best results."" Asked later if he thought there was genuinely a possibility that the UK might not leave the EU, Mr Tusk said at a news conference: ""Politics without dreams would be a nightmare. ""If you had my experience from my part of Europe, you would know that miracles do happen and some of my political dreams have come true. ""This is maybe the best part of politics - that everything in fact is possible. ""But at the same time, I am a realist and this is why first of all we should start our negotiations as effectively as possible. ""The final decision is also a decision for Britain and for UK citizens. ""But dreams are something still very nice."""

The flats - a mix of one, two and three bedroom apartments - will be offered as one of the options to permanently rehouse residents from Grenfell Tower. Additional Whitehall cash has also been made available to furnish the flats to speed up the move. The properties, in two affordable housing blocks at the site, are situated around 1.5 miles from Grenfell Tower. The announcement comes a week after a fire destroyed the 24-storey block in west London - with at least 79 people now dead or missing, presumed dead.

Last week, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for empty homes near the scene of the fire in north Kensington to be requisitioned to house families. Meanwhile, Airbnb has called on its London hosts to open their homes for free to Red Cross staff and volunteers who have been supporting those affected by the fire."

As well as five murders, the 45-year-old admitted five attempted murders, including against police officers. He also pleaded guilty to 23 counts of conspiracy to murder, directing terrorism and membership of a proscribed organisation. Haggarty, who worked as a police informant during the Troubles, was interviewed more than 1,000 times by detectives and 23,000 pages of transcripts were presented in evidence. His offences from 1991 to 2007 included the loyalist murders of John Harbinson, Sean McParland, Gary Convie, Eamon Fox and Sean McDermott. The charge sheet also included aiding and abetting murder, kidnap, possession of explosives, hijacking, false imprisonment, arson, intimidation and conspiracy to riot. Haggarty, who is believed to be living at a secret location outside Northern Ireland, is expected to receive a reduced sentence in exchange for his co-operation with the authorities. He may even walk free after his sentence hearing in September as he has already served three years in custody, the equivalent of a six-year sentence.

Describing Haggarty as ""just a hitman"", Mr Fox said: ""His hands are deep in blood along with people he's going to expose and because of who he's going to expose I think it's not going to finish."" Detective Superintendent Richard Campbell said the guilty pleas marked a ""milestone"" for the victims and their families."
2017-06-23,Theresa May has just survived what must undoubtedly the worst 10 days of her political career and the next 10 offer little respite.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170623180951/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-fights-for-survival-as-brexit-talks-start-10919984,"The Prime Minister is fighting on a number of fronts as she tries to command the country and her party in the wake of that crushing election defeat that has left her leadership in freefall and her credibility in tatters.It will be a crunch week for her as she struggles to get her premiership back on track amid rumours that she could face an imminent leadership challenge. And she will have to deal with the fallout of the van attack near the Finsbury Park mosque, which she said is being treated ""as a potential terrorist attack"". In her inbox this week - a major speech on Wednesday at the start of the Queen's Speech, where she will set out her legislative programme for the next two years.MPs won't actually vote on it until 28 June, but her benches will be watching her closely - every performance a test of her mettle after her faltering response to the Grenfell Tower disaster last week.There is also the matter of the DUP confidence-and-supply deal that still needs to be nailed down. No 10 are confident that the Unionists will vote with Mrs May, giving her an expected majority of around 13 - but she has yet to reach agreement.That deal is complicated by the wider politics of Northern Ireland, amid concerns that the deal with the DUP could hamper efforts to re-establish the stalled power-sharing executive at Stormont: to that end, the Prime Minister will on Monday meet the new Irish PM Leo Varadkar in Downing Street.""We will discuss Northern Ireland and the need to re-establish devolved Government, and Brexit, focusing on how we can avoid any adverse impact on the rights and freedoms of our citizens, on trade and the economy,"" Mr Varadkar said ahead of his bilateral meeting. Then, of course, is the start of Brexit talks, the Tories' fragile peace holding over the weekend after her Chancellor confirmed that there would be no rowing back on the promise to leave the single market and customs union. But those tensions will no doubt rise once more when the tussles over Britain's EU exit bill and the future deal begin in earnest. :: Labour claims Brexit 'disarray' on eve of talks in BrusselsHer MPs are in no doubt of her shortcomings - revealed in full technicolour during the election campaign, and then again last week when she initially failed to meet survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. ""Everyone knows she's not Mrs Emotional in public,"" said one minister, adding that they thought she had the support of most of her party still.But the stories about whether it's time for Mrs May to go - and who might replace her - won't dissipate. There are suggestions that once leader contender David Davis might be put up as a caretaker Prime Minister, rather as Michael Howard was back in 2004. There's talk of a ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge if she waters down Brexit - though there is no sign so far that she intends to do that.Another senior party figure said allies of Boris Johnson were taking soundings from colleagues, which was playing quite badly with some MPs who are adamant that further Tory infighting would play badly with the public. ""She's the only show in town,"" said the MP. ""The public don't want to see us knifing each other.""Mr Johnson's team insist any suggestion he's on manoeuvres is ""completely false"". ""Boris is supporting the Prime Minister and anyone doing this sort of thing is not acting with his knowledge or support,"" they say.While some in the party believe the Prime Minister is now a busted flush, opinion seems to be coalescing around the view that now is not the right time to change leader. As Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, put it on Sunday: ""I think what the country needs now is a period of calm while we get on with the job in hand. ""We've got one very serious issues to address, including the Brexit negotiations just starting. Theresa is leading the Government and I think the Government needs to get on with its job. ""And do you know what? I think actually that's what most people in this country will think - that the Government just needs to get on with the day job of Government.""Getting on with the job has become her new mantra as grand designs give way to hand-to-mouth survival. How long she stays in No 10 depends on her party, but for most MPs her continued leadership remains the least worst option - for now."

Some of the buildings where problem cladding has been identified include: Chalcots estate, Swiss Cottage, central London Camden Council says it will remove cladding from five towers after tests raised concerns about its safety. Council leader Georgia Gould told Sky News the authority believed fireproof panels were installed during a 2006 refurbishment, but that proved ""not to be the case"". Until the cladding is removed, council staff will carry out round-the-clock fire safety patrols on the estate's corridors. The company in charge of fitting the cladding to the affected Camden towers oversaw the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, according to its website. Rivers Apartments, Tottenham, north London Newlon Housing Trust said the 22-storey tower block was fitted with the same cladding reportedly used on Grenfell Tower. However, following an ""extensive safety audit"", London Fire Brigade said it would be considered a ""low fire risk"" after modifications and technical clarifications.Village 135 development, Wythenshawe, Manchester Staff from the Wythenshawe Community Housing Group are removing 78 ""failed"" panels from a small area of the development. Greater Manchester Fire Service said its fire risk audit of the site concluded the building ""is safe for all residents"". It added: ""We are happy with WCHG's active and passive fire systems"". Mount Wise Tower Estate, Plymouth The outer layer of cladding on three 16-storey blocks was found to be aluminium coated with a polyethylene core, which has the lowest fire rating score. Plymouth Community Homes says it is removing the panels and security teams are monitoring the blocks 24/7. It is also installing heat detectors in every flat and sprinkler systems in each tower. Pendleton, Salford Cladding on nine high-rise blocks has been identified as being made from aluminium composite material (ACM), which was used on Grenfell Tower. Samples are being sent to the Department for Communities and Local Government to be tested independently by fire experts. Pendleton Together, the management company that runs the blocks, said questions about the cladding were a ""real concern"" for residents. The firm said every householder in a high-rise block would have a home visit to carry out basic fire safety checks on doors and smoke alarms Patrols of the buildings are also being carried out ""as a precautionary safety measure"". Braithwaite House, Islington, central London ACM was also detected in cladding fitted to this high-rise and Islington Council says the panels are to be removed. Test results from the other blocks, Harvist Estate and Brunswick Estate, are yet to be returned, the council said. Ferrier Point, Newham, east London The tower was reportedly found to have cladding panels with ACM. Refurbishment of the building, including cladding, was overseen by Rydon, the company involved in the refit of Grenfell Tower. However, the insulation behind the cladding was said to be highly fire-resistant Rockwool Duoslab. Two other buildings in the borough are also said to have ACM cladding, Newham Council said. ""We are following the process as set out by DCLG for sample testing of buildings with ACM cladding,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Once the results are known, we will take whatever action is necessary to ensure our residents are safe. Barnet, north London Three towers were found to have similar rain screen panels on their cladding as Grenfell Tower, but a non-combustible insulation material. Granville Point, Harpenmead Point and Templemead Point blocks were all reclad in 2012, Barnet Council said. Samples have been sent to the Government. Horatia House and Leamington House, Portsmouth Cladding fitted to the two high-rises is being removed after tests revealed a fire risk. Portsmouth City Council deputy leader Luke Stubbs said round-the-clock fire patrols have been put in place and firefighters have carried out a full assessment. He said: ""The buildings are safe to stay in with all of the existing safety measures still in place."" Halifax Independent contractors are checking three blocks in Lower Mixenden, a village outside Halifax. Samples of cladding from Jumples Court, Mixenden Court and Wheatley Court are being sent to the Government. However, Together Housing said initial visual inspection suggests it is not the same type as that used on Grenfell Tower. Harold Lambert Court, Sheffield The high-rise is being checked by management firm, Together Housing, with cladding samples sent off for analysis."

It comes after researchers at London Metropolitan University found 121 different types of bacteria and mould on public transport in the capital. Eight of all the bacteria discovered were found to be among the most threatening to human health, with the Victoria Line deemed to be the dirtiest. Around 50 Tube stations will be cleaned each night with magnetic wands and industrial vacuum cleaners used to remove dust, oil, grease and metal particles. Mr Khan said: ""I've asked for an updated scientific analysis of pollution on the Tube so we can fully assess the air quality levels and take appropriate measures to ensure that the air is clean."" The movement of trains along rail lines, engineering works and skin particles all contribute to dust on the network. London Underground managing director Mark Wild said: ""As scientific understanding of the effects of particles develops, we are ensuring that we're both using the very latest research and that we're doing everything possible to keep the air underground clean for our customers and staff."""

The Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment experiment aims to measure the forest's capacity to capture carbon released by fossil fuel burning, and answer questions about the capacity of trees to absorb carbon pollution long-term. Michael Tausz, the university's co-director of forest research, said: ""Forests happily take a bit more CO2 because that's their main nutrient. But we don't know how much more and whether they can do that indefinitely."" The experiment consists of a series of masts built into six 30-metre wide sections of woodland, reaching up about 25 metres into the forest canopy. Concentrated CO2 is fed through pipes to the top of the masts, where it is pumped into the foliage. Last year, scientists at the UN World Meteorological Organisation estimated that carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide levels were at their highest in at least 800,000 years."

One culprit figured out that disconnecting certain cables in the vending machines would enable them to dispense unlimited amounts of food, even if a card had run out of money. After making the sweet discovery, they then told friends who began stealing snacks for themselves. It took months before the US intelligence agency realised the junk food was being taken without payment through the sophisticated scheme. After suspicions were raised, officials put surveillance cameras on the machines and put an end to the scam. The perpetrator, one of thousands of contractors in the CIA, admitted he had used his knowledge of computer networks to cadge the candy. He and his cabal were swiftly rounded up, escorted from the building and fired by their employers.

The authoritarian communist regime released the 22-year-old last week for what it described as humanitarian reasons and he died on Monday in a US hospital. The University of Virginia student had to be medically evacuated from the country after it emerged he had fallen into a coma soon after being jailed in March 2016. His parents have condemned the ""awful tumultuous treatment"" their son received at the hands of the North Koreans. :: US professor held in North Korea But according to KCNA, a spokesman of the North's National Reconciliation Council said: ""Our relevant agencies treat all criminals who committed crimes against (our) republic strictly based on domestic law and international standards, and Warmbier was no different."" The agency accused Seoul of damaging Pyongyang's image with its ""slanderous talk about cruel treatment and torture"" while having no knowledge of the ""humanitarian"" treatment Mr Warmbier received in the North. No further details were provided on his treatment while in custody or why he fell into a coma. US doctors said he had suffered a severe neurological injury from an unknown cause. Mr Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labour last year after he admitted trying to steal a propaganda sign from the staff-only area of a hotel he was staying at. Following the news of Mr Warmbier's death, US President Donald Trump said that ""bad things"" happened in ""brutal"" North Korea but at least he died at home with his parents. He added: ""Otto's fate deepens my administration's determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency. ""The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim."" North Korea has been accused of of using foreign detainees to try to win diplomatic concessions. Three Americans remain in custody in the North."

The OCCI will be used to share experience, Facebook said, and will lead to awareness campaigns and better ""counterspeech"" to fight extremism. Internet companies have been under increasing pressure from the Government over their role in the spread of hate speech. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the Government was ""not frightened"" to sanction firms who fail to remove extreme material. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said: ""There is no place for hate or violence on Facebook. ""We use technology like AI to find and remove terrorist propaganda, and we have teams of counterterrorism experts and reviewers around the world working to keep extremist content off our platform."" The OCCI has already launched in Germany and France. Fiyaz Mughal, founder of anti-Muslim hatred company Tell Mama which is an OCCI founding partner, said: ""This initiative is much needed given that a vast amount of material online may be insulting and sometimes inflammatory, though it may not cross a legal threshold for action.

A telephone number was given for them to arrange alternative accommodation but some victims have told us there was either no response or no answer as to where they should go. The letter from the council said: ""Despite efforts to extend your stay... regrettably the hotel has stated that they do not have availability to extend your booking. ""You will need to check out of this hotel by 4pm. ""Please contact the accommodation team as a matter of urgency to discuss your urgent options."" The survivors were in 20 rooms at the hotel in Kensington and the Red Cross said they have all since been able to find other accommodation. But local community groups helping at the hotel said some of the victims have been moved between three or four hotels since the 14 June fire. Asif Hussain from the Muslim Council of Britain is one of those who have been trying to help the victims. He said: ""When they rang the number that was written on the letter even as late as 12.30, they weren't told, they didn't know where they were going, they had to pack their bags, get ready to go but they didn't know where."" He added: ""The galling (thing is that) the council has hardly had any representative here at the hotel, they've sent representatives from other councils this morning to help them. ""So there has been no one for (victims) to talk to, no one for them to complain to. ""They have been left completely in the lurch, completely in the dark not knowing where they are going until a taxi arrives at the hotel, taken to the taxi and at that point they know where they are going."" He said that he had chaperoned an elderly survivor into a taxi and was told she was moving for the fourth time in 10 days. ""Ten days with your possessions in a carrier bag, not knowing where you are going to get food to eat is a very long time. ""For this to happen in this country, in this day and age in the richest borough in the country, is an absolute disgrace."" There are 79 people dead or missing presumed dead in the fire at the 24-storey tower block but hundreds of other residents who escaped the fire have lost their homes. A Grenfell fire response spokesperson said the hotel ""was unable to continue accommodating 30 households due to previous bookings"". ""We obviously regret disruption to people who have already suffered terrible upheaval and we are trying hard to avoid unnecessary moves. ""Those leaving the Holiday Inn have been offered alternative rooms at hotels at County Hall and Waterloo in central London.

The 70-year-old philanthropist and heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical empire has known Mr Trump for years, but originally supported his rival Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries.

She said the three million EU citizens living in the UK should take ""reassurance and confidence"" from what she had laid out at a European Council summit in Brussels on Thursday. The proposals, which are subject to reciprocal arrangements being guaranteed for UK citizens in the remaining 27 EU member states, have been given a cautious welcome by top Brussels figures. But political parties back home have slammed the offer as ""too little too late"", a year on from Britain's vote to leave. Elements of the proposals are likely to be contested by Brussels, including the cut-off date for entitlement to stay in the UK and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Mrs May acknowledged this as she arrived for the second day of the summit. ""Of course, there will be details of this arrangement which will be part of the negotiation process,"" she said. But the PM added: ""I want to reassure all those EU citizens who are in the UK, who have made their lives and homes in the UK, that no one will have to leave, we won't be seeing families split apart. ""This is a fair and serious offer. I want to give those EU citizens in the UK certainty about the future of their lives, but I also want to see that certainty given to UK citizens who are living in the EU."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said it was a ""first step, but not sufficient"", while the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said: ""Mays ""generous offer"" does not fully guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was a ""good start"", but that there were many issues still to be resolved. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was more lukewarm, calling it a ""particularly vague proposal"" and describing it using a Flemish expression for a dubious gift. ""We don't want a cat in the bag,"" he said. ""We want the rights of EU citizens to be permanently guaranteed."" A Polish diplomatic source told Sky News: ""(It's) good that the rights could be granted, it seems, after five years of residence - very important for Polish citizens."" Under the plan, EU nationals who have been in the UK for more than five years would be able to claim a new ""settled status"", entitling them to the same rights as full British citizens to healthcare, education, welfare and pensions. Those who have been in the UK for a shorter time would be able to stay until they hit the five-year threshold for settled status, while others who arrive after a cut-off date will be given a ""grace period"", expected to be two years, to regularise their immigration status. The introduction of a grace period raises the prospect that large numbers of people who arrive during the exit negotiations may be allowed to stay. The cut-off date for entitlement to apply is yet to be set, but it will come somewhere between the day Britain activated Article 50 (29 March 2017) and the day Brexit takes effect (29 March 2019). It is thought the UK is reserving the option of setting an early cut-off for residency rights in case there is a surge of migrants arriving as Brexit approaches."

She said: ""Although we have concerns that the fire retardant cladding used may not adhere to recognised government guidance on compliance with the building regulations for use in high rise buildings, an independent fire expert has assured us that these hotels are safe and that they are entirely satisfied that there are robust fire safety measures and evacuation procedures in place to protect our guests and team members."" :: People who believe they own a Hotpoint fridge freezer model number FF175BP (white) or FF175BG (grey) can call Whirlpool Corporation's freephone hotline on 0800 316 3826."

The Grenfell Response Team denied claims victims were being given emergency accommodation in tower blocks, adding that 140 hotel placements have been made for people living in Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk. Victims' outstanding energy bills have been written off. On Wednesday, Mr Javid announced 68 new social housing units at a luxury development in Kensington had been acquired for victims. Meanwhile, every tower block in Birmingham is to be fitted with a sprinkler system. All 213 blocks in its area are being assessed, city council leader John Clancy said."
2017-06-23,A sniper in the Canadian special forces has broken a British-held record for the longest confirmed kill after shooting dead an IS fighter from more than two miles away.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170623180951/http://news.sky.com/story/canadian-sniper-breaks-record-by-killing-is-fighter-more-than-two-miles-away-10924478,"The bullet was fired from a high-rise building with a McMillan TAC-50 sniper rifle in Iraq, a military source told Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper. It took less than 10 seconds to travel 3,540 metres (2.19 miles) - approximately the distance between Big Ben and the Tower of London. ""The shot in question actually disrupted a Daesh (Islamic State) attack on Iraqi security forces,"" the source said. ""Instead of dropping a bomb that could potentially kill civilians in the area, it is a very precise application of force and because it was so far way, the bad guys didn't have a clue what was happening."" The previous record for longest confirmed kill was set by British Army sniper Craig Harrison, who shot two militants in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, from 2,475 metres (1.53 miles). The Canadian Special Operations Command confirmed that a member of its Joint Task Force 2 ""successfully hit a target"", but refused to say when the shot was fired. It said: ""For operational security reasons and to preserve the safety of our personnel and our Coalition partners we will not discuss precise details on when and how this incident took place."" The shot was independently verified by camera and required the sniper to take wind, ballistics and the curvature of the Earth into account. Canadian major general Michael Rouleau described the kill as ""unprecedented"". ""In this case, there was a digital record from another observation post, actually unknown to the sniper in question,"" he told the Globe and Mail. ""I have reviewed it and it has been reviewed by some of our allies as well. This is an irrefutable act."" He added: ""There is an element of art involved where the sniper actually has to estimate where the Daesh fighter is going to be, because when he pulls the trigger, there is just under 10 seconds of time of flight for the round. ""There is a lot of science involved in terms of the ballistic calculations but there is a subjective element of assessing what the winds are doing and whatnot."""
2017-06-23,Insulation boards fitted to the outside of Grenfell Tower gave off highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas which may have contributed to the deaths of some of the 79 confirmed victims.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170623180951/http://news.sky.com/story/toxic-gases-released-during-grenfell-tower-fire-may-have-caused-some-deaths-10922685,"Fire toxicity experts have told Sky News the insulation boards installed during a refurbishment of the tower produce the deadly gas when they burn, and their positioning meant every flat could have been filled with enough gas to kill those inside. At least three of those injured in the fire have been treated with an antidote for hydrogen cyanide poisoning in hospital, and the number of those affected may be higher. The gas could have incapacitated some residents, but establishing its role in the cause of death may be impossible because of the condition of the victims. King's College Hospital confirmed to Sky News that three of the 12 patients it received from the fire were treated with the hydrogen cyanide antidote Cyanokit. Four other hospital trusts declined to comment on the treatment administered to those injured in the fire. An initial 68 patients were taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 receiving critical care and some put into induced comas to aid in the recovery of damaged airways. As of Wednesday morning, 10 people were still being treated in four hospitals, six of them in critical care. The insulation used at Grenfell Tower was made of Polyisocyanurate (PIR), rigid plastic foam sandwiched between two sheets of aluminium foil that supplied in 15cm-thick boards. The PIR itself is flammable, but the aluminium foil is intended to disperse flames and prevent it catching fire. The boards were fitted against the exterior wall of Grenfell Tower, behind the cladding that was installed to improve the appearance of the building. Richard Hull, professor of chemistry and fire science at the University of Central Lancashire, told Sky News that the gas produced by the insulation when it burned may have been deadly. ""The outside wall of the building had 150mm of PIR foam (fitted), and once the fire had spread to that every flat would have its own source of PIR foam, which would have produced enough hydrogen cyanide to kill all the people in that flat,"" he said. Professor Hull co-authored a peer-reviewed study in 2011 into the fire toxicity of six insulation materials which was published in the Energy & Building journal. The study established that PIR was the most toxic. The report also warned that while modern, lightweight building materials are cheaper to produce and offer improved thermal insulation, they pose a greater risk than traditional materials in the event of fire. Professor Hull said the warnings in his report should have been heeded. ""It's been an accident waiting to happen and unfortunately we've got to the stage now where the accident has happened and we're standing here saying 'I told you so'. ""It would have been much better if people had listened to us earlier on when we published the report."" The insulation board was manufactured by Celotex, who say that if fitted correctly it is the first PIR insulation board that can meet regulations for use on buildings above 18m (59ft) tall. When contacted for comment, Celotex referred Sky News to a statement on its website published last Friday. It said: ""As with the rest of the nation our thoughts continue to be with those affected by the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower in London. ""On Wednesday, as soon as we were able to, we confirmed that our records showed a Celotex product (RS5000) was purchased for use in refurbishing the building. ""This product has a fire rating classification of Class 0, in accordance with British Standards. ""We will of course assist the relevant authorities fully with any enquiries they have."""

2017-06-23,More than 120 supercars were seized as authorities dismantled an elaborate tax avoidance scam in Britain and Thailand.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170623180951/http://news.sky.com/story/stolen-british-supercars-shipped-to-thailand-in-tax-scam-10923541,"Dozens of luxury vehicles including Lamborghinis, Porsches and BMWs were stolen from British streets as part of the scam. It used a range of complex methods to bypass the hefty taxes levied on supercars imported into Thailand, which usually stand at around 328%. One tactic for avoiding the taxes involved dismantling cars, shipping them from the UK in parts and reassembling them in Thailand. Other scammers simply lied to customs officials about what kind of car was being imported. Eight Lamborghini Aventadors were declared to be cheaper Gallardo models, and customs officials either failed to notice or deliberately ignored the obvious discrepancy. The most common method, however, involved simply understating the value of a car, often by many thousands of pounds, at customs. Around 30 businesses are being investigated in the operation against the scam and a series of raids have been conducted in recent weeks. ""More than 1,000 supercars are implicated in the undervaluing scam,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Korawat Panprapakorn, who is leading the operation with Thailand's Department for Special Investigations. ""This practice has been going on for a long time."" The scam was uncovered when owners in the UK reported their cars stolen, and British authorities requested that Thailand help recover the vehicles. Authorities estimated that 38 stolen vehicles have been taken from the UK to Thailand, with a total value of some £2.3 million. Seven cars - two Lamborghinis, two BMW M4s, two Porsche Boxters and a Nissan GTR- have been seized at a used car dealership in Bangkok. The owner of the dealership, Indharasak Techaterasiri, denied allegations that he had under-valued the cars in his showroom, claiming that the fault lies with customs officials. Mr Techaterasiri, who goes by the nickname ""Unity Boy"", has filed to sue the DSI after officers closed down his showroom. Police arrested him on fraud charges after wealthy customers complained that the cars they had purchased may now be illegal. ""They keep saying on the news that all these cars are stolen, that I am a criminal,"" Techaterasiri, who imports 500-600 cars from the UK every year, said. ""It isn't fair for me."" The scandal uncovers the hidden workings of an extreme luxury market in Thailand, where an economic slump has not slowed the extravagances of a billionaire class. Supercars can often be seen on Bangkok's gridlocked streets. Britain is the favourite source for luxury imports as both countries drive on the left hand side of the road."

Prince Philip was admitted to a private hospital in London on Tuesday evening suffering from an infection arising as a result of a pre-existing condition. He was described as being in ""good spirits"" during his stay, which had been recommended as a precautionary measure by his doctor. The Duke left from the back of King Edward VII Hospital on Thursday morning and was driven away. Philip, 96, announced in May that he is to retire from public duties in the autumn. He is a patron, president or member of more than 780 organisations, which he will continue to support. He was treated for a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and a bladder infection in 2012, but has enjoyed good health for most of his life. Buckingham Palace has said his decision to retire is not health related. On the first day of Royal Ascot on Tuesday Prince Philip accompanied the Queen and other members of the Royal Family in a public appearance, and was on ""good form"" according to a source. The State Opening of Parliament on Wednesday saw Prince Charles accompany the Queen in his father's absence. The Duke once remarked that he roughly follows the Atkins diet, and is said to be an advocate of healthy eating and exercise."

But payments set to be added to consumer bills have soared from an estimated £6bn to £30bn, a NAO report said. The report added that the costs and risks to consumers have not been sufficiently considered and that it will not be known for decades whether the plant is value for money. The case for Hinkley Point has also weakened since the Government agreed key commercial terms in 2013, the NAO added. The company building the plant - which is two-thirds owned by French energy giant EDF and one-third by China General Nuclear Power Group - will receive a guaranteed price for the power it generates. But the deal for the ""strike price"" - £92.50 per megawatt/hour in 2012 prices - was agreed without competition. Falling fossil fuel costs, which reduce wholesale prices of electricity, mean the forecast for top-up payments on consumer bills have ballooned. Delays have pushed back construction of the plant, while the expected cost of low-carbon alternatives have fallen more than expected, the report found. An estimated £10-£15 will be added to the average bill up to 2030 to pay for Hinkley Point C, but that could rise if it is delayed. The report found that BEIS has not taken into account the fact that bill payers will be locked into paying for the plant after 2030, when low-carbon alternatives will be cheaper. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""The department has committed electricity consumers and taxpayers to a high cost and risky deal in a changing energy marketplace. ""Time will tell whether the deal represents value for money, but we cannot say the department has maximised the chances that it will be."" An EDF Energy spokesman said the report showed Hinkley Point C remained good value compared with alternative choices. ""Relaunching the UK nuclear new build industry at Hinkley Point C will enable costs for future projects, in particular Sizewell C, to be lower,"" he said. A BEIS spokesman said: ""Consumers won't pay a penny until Hinkley is built; it will provide clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes and creating more than 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships in the process."""
2017-06-23,A decorated senior detective says an increasing number of police officers are contemplating suicide because of the strain being put on forces across the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170623180951/http://news.sky.com/story/pressure-on-police-forces-sees-officers-contemplating-suicide-says-senior-detective-10924253,"The warning from Detective Inspector Warren Hines comes as the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) calls on the Government to increase police funding. In an exclusive interview, DI Hines, who heads up one of six murder squads in the West Midlands, told Sky News that police forces simply cannot cope with the work they are being asked to do because they are not properly resourced. Budget cuts imposed under the Conservative government have seen more than 19,000 police posts shed since 2010. DI Hines said: ""We really are at a point now where we can't cope with what we're expected to deal with. Sickness and mental health problems amongst my colleagues are rife. ""We've got examples of police officers who have been conveyed to hospital from work because they've had a meltdown. ""I'm aware of incidents where sergeants in our public protection units are allocating work on the basis of who is the least tearful that morning when they get to work."" The decorated veteran officer said many forces had been forced to cancel annual leave and increase working hours following a series of high profile major incidents. There have been four terror attacks in three months - at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, London Bridge and Finsbury Park - as well as the Grenfell Tower fire. Officers from West Midlands were sent to the capital this week to help out in the aftermath of the latest attack. DI Hines said many of his colleagues are now at breaking point. ""In the last 15 months alone, around 80 officers in the West Midlands force have been referred to the National Police Federation Welfare Support Programme,"" he said. ""Those are people who are undergoing a significant mental health crisis. ""They're experiencing suicidal thoughts and tendencies and they are at risk of doing something really serious to hurt themselves, and this is only as a result of the pressures that they are being put under."" The Government has promised that forces will not face any further budget cuts for the remainder of this Parliament, but the NPCC says the current ""flat cash"" settlement for policing means force budgets will fall in real terms. Dave Thompson, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police and the national lead on finance for the NPCC, said: ""Taking into account inflation and cost pressures, there will be less money every year for forces on top of real-terms cuts of 18% since 2010. ""Many forces are now using considerable reserves to maintain current staff numbers that, when spent, will see numbers falling even further."""
2017-06-23,"Banksy's secret identity might have been revealed in a radio interview in which DJ Goldie referred to the artist as ""Robert"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170623180951/http://news.sky.com/story/banksys-secret-identity-who-is-robert-and-has-dj-goldie-slipped-up-10924582,"The British DJ was talking to hip hop artist Scroobius Pip on his weekly podcast on Tuesday when he was asked about graffiti art being misunderstood. ""Give me a bubble letter and put it on a t-shirt and write 'Banksy' on it and we're sorted. We can sell it now,"" Goldie, a street artist himself, told Pip. ""No disrespect to Robert, I think he is a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over."" Awkward silence, change of topic and the internet goes crazy with speculation. Now, all paths are seemingly leading back to one man: Robert Del Naja, aka 3D. The Massive Attack front man, a friend of Goldie's, had been linked to the anonymous artist in the past. But the rumours died off Del Nala swiftly denied the claims himself, telling a crowd of fans that ""we are all Banksy"". ""No, it's not true. But it's a worthy reminder what a bunch of delinquent ecstatic transgressors Massive Attack have always been, and how it was not so long ago that such subversive voices were carried through music before migrating more fully to visual culture,"" he said. But we are not so easily put off, and have listed a few reasons why ""Robert"" could well be Del Naja. Just check out all of Massive Attack albums' cover art. Del Naja did it all and you can clearly see his roots in street art: In a rare interview, with Swindle magazine in 2008, Banksy told the story of when he first saw Del Naja's graffiti and was inspired by it. ""When I was about 10 years old, a kid called 3D was painting the street hard,"" he said. ""3D quit painting and formed the band Massive Attack, which may have been a good thing for him but was a big loss for the city."" Which takes us to... Massive Attack is a trip hop band from Bristol, formed in the late 1980s by Del Naja and Daddy G, former part of the Bristol club collective The Wild Bunch. We know Banksy's from Bristol, and his work is tightly linked to the city's underground music scene. This is perhaps the biggest clue of all. Many before me have carefully traced Banksy's steps, following his works from San Francisco to the West Bank and Naples. Glasgow journalist Craig Williams published a piece last year claiming Banksy, like the biblical Demon, is ""not one, but many"". ""What if Banksy is a group of people who have stencilling different locations both at home and abroad?,"" he asked. The theory is that Banksy is in fact a collective of Massive Attack groupies who follow the band around, painting where they go. The reasoning behind it is that wherever the group puts on a gig a Banksy mural mysteriously appears. And then there is Naples... Naples is the only Italian city where Banksy has done one of his works and, curiously enough, Del Naja's childhood teams are Bristol City... and Napoli. ""It's probably because my dad's Italian. He's a Napoli fan and was used to watching top-flight stuff,"" Del Naja told The Guardian. ""I didn't have an income back then so I couldn't go to matches and we hadn't been to see my family in Naples since I was little."" That's right: Del Naja has roots which tie him to the land of pizza. Banksy is known for his social and political critiques. Most of his visual art is aimed at big corporations, right-wing politics and consumerism. He is also in favour of a Palestinian state, having created the ""worst view in the world"" in the wall that separates Israel from the Palestinian territories. Del Naja has repeatedly refused to play concerts in Israel in a stance against the Israeli government and its policies. Convinced? If not, there are several other theories floating around. These include a couple of men who have been arrested trying to impersonate Banksy, a parking attendant at Banksy's Dismaland, a French artist with a bad reputation and Robin Gunningham, a former public school boy who criminologists at London's Queen Mary University have profiled as being the elusive artist."
2017-06-23,NHS Trusts have been told to urgently check their buildings to establish whether any are clad in materials implicated in the the Grenfell Tower fire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170623180951/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-trusts-told-to-check-buildings-for-combustible-cladding-10925385,"Regulator NHS Improvement has written to around 200 Trusts in England asking them to report back when safety checks have been completed. In a letter sent on Monday, they asked Trusts to pay particular attention to tall buildings on hospital estates and those with in-patients - and to report back within 24 hours. Fourteen high rise blocks across nine local authorities have been identified as having potentially combustible cladding since the fire at the Grenfell Tower, which is believed to have killed at least 79 people. About 600 tower blocks identified as being clad in plastic materials are being tested and those found to have flammable cladding or insulation may have to be evacuated and the material removed. Police said on Friday that the cladding on the high rise building failed safety tests, but the insulation on the block was even more highly more flammable. The letter from NHS Improvement asked Trusts to detail what type of cladding is used on all buildings on their estates, including those built under Private Finance Initiative (PFI) deals; which contractors carried out the work; how many storeys buildings have; whether in-patients are present; and if any risk assessment has been carried out in the last year. The director of estates and facilities told Trusts he needed the information in order to allow the regulator to target assistance at hospitals that may need it. An extract of the letter from Simon Corden, published by Health Service Journal, reads: ""We do need to take all reasonable precautionary measures and be ready to rapidly implement any recommendations that come from the findings of the ongoing investigations."" Downing Street has said a testing facility being used to check council and housing association buildings is also available to the owners of private blocks and they are being encouraged to use it. Premier Inn has said it is ""concerned"" about whether cladding on some of its hotels meets safety standards - but added that it is not the same material as that on Grenfell Tower. More follows..."

Premiums are tipped to rise further still according to John Blevins, a pricing expert at the research consultancy, because the full impact of a recent 2% hike in the rate of insurance premium tax (IPT) are not included in the figures. He said drivers would need to shop around to limit the hikes to their premiums. The IPT tax hike came into force earlier this month. The cost to cover cars, homes, pet and health insurance are all affected with the rate of IPT increasing from 10% to 12%. It means the rate of tax paid on most insurance policies has doubled in less than two years, up from 6% in 2015. Car insurance premiums were calculated by Consumer Intelligence by comparing the prices offered to 3,250 people by major price comparison websites and direct insurers. Researchers found drivers aged 21 to 24 are paying the most on average at £1,202 - but have seen slightly lower annual premium increases at 13.1%. Motorists aged over 50 are experiencing the biggest rises at 17.9%, however, are paying around £418 for cover. The analysis also revealed that drivers in London are typically paying the highest premiums of around £1,000 - more than double the £474 average bill in Scotland and the South West of England. Here are the average premiums and increases over the past year across the country, according to the research: :: London, £1,000, 16.7% :: North West, £867, 15.7% :: West Midlands, £748, 13% :: Yorkshire and the Humber, £658, 15.7% :: North East, £646, 18.9% :: Eastern England, £574, 16.5% :: East Midlands, £553, 17.6% :: South East, £549, 13.5% :: Wales, £539, 14.4% :: Scotland, £474, 16.6% :: South West, £474, 15.9%"

A telephone number was given for them to arrange alternative accommodation but some victims have told us there was either no response or no answer as to where they should go. The letter from the council said: ""Despite efforts to extend your stay... regrettably the hotel has stated that they do not have availability to extend your booking. ""You will need to check out of this hotel by 4pm. ""Please contact the accommodation team as a matter of urgency to discuss your urgent options."" The survivors were in 20 rooms at the hotel in Kensington and the Red Cross said they have all since been able to find other accommodation. But local community groups helping at the hotel said some of the victims have been moved between three or four hotels since the 14 June fire. Asif Hussain from the Muslim Council of Britain is one of those who have been trying to help the victims. He said: ""When they rang the number that was written on the letter even as late as 12.30, they weren't told, they didn't know where they were going, they had to pack their bags, get ready to go but they didn't know where."" He added: ""The galling (thing is that) the council has hardly had any representative here at the hotel, they've sent representatives from other councils this morning to help them. ""So there has been no one for (victims) to talk to, no one for them to complain to. ""They have been left completely in the lurch, completely in the dark not knowing where they are going until a taxi arrives at the hotel, taken to the taxi and at that point they know where they are going."" He said that he had chaperoned an elderly survivor into a taxi and was told she was moving for the fourth time in 10 days. ""Ten days with your possessions in a carrier bag, not knowing where you are going to get food to eat is a very long time.

On Saturday, Ms Phillips tackled Camden Council leader Georgia Gould over her plight. In a heated exchange, the pensioner told Ms Gould she was ""so absolutely stressed"" by the upheaval. :: Cladding tests: 27 tower blocks fail checks The second-floor resident of Taplow Tower asked: ""Why were hotels not looked at before we were all evacuated?

She said the council ""just had to act quickly"" after being informed buildings were unsafe by the London Fire Brigade on Friday afternoon. :: Where has unsafe tower cladding been identified?

""Three to four weeks is what they are currently guesstimating. I imagine it's not much more than a guesstimate."""

It comes after researchers at London Metropolitan University found 121 different types of bacteria and mould on public transport in the capital. Eight of all the bacteria discovered were found to be among the most threatening to human health, with the Victoria Line deemed to be the dirtiest. Around 50 Tube stations will be cleaned each night with magnetic wands and industrial vacuum cleaners used to remove dust, oil, grease and metal particles. Mr Khan said: ""I've asked for an updated scientific analysis of pollution on the Tube so we can fully assess the air quality levels and take appropriate measures to ensure that the air is clean."" The movement of trains along rail lines, engineering works and skin particles all contribute to dust on the network. London Underground managing director Mark Wild said: ""As scientific understanding of the effects of particles develops, we are ensuring that we're both using the very latest research and that we're doing everything possible to keep the air underground clean for our customers and staff."""

It seemed like an olive branch held out for the EU to take hold of. Instead they took one look at the branch and rejected it. It was ""below expectations"" said president of the council Donald Tusk. It was ""not sufficient"", added Jean-Claude Junker. The President of the Commission was asked by a reporter if he was any clearer on what the UK wants. ""No,"" he said before skulking off. The body language and the flat rejection is a reminder of the uphill struggle Mrs May faces. Her offer is to keep the free movement door open until an agreed ""cut off point"" where, presumably, it isn't slammed shut but new controls - whatever they might be - come into force. We've yet to hear the Government utter the Vote Leave and UKIP mantra of an ""Australian-style points system"". Nor will the Prime Minister confirm the number of people she would expect to continue coming to the UK from the EU after this point. However, she has said that EU citizens who have been in the UK five years can automatically remain. Those who've been here less time, and those who arrive lawfully during a subsequent grace period, will also be allowed time to regularise their status over five years. Certainly there are creases to iron out, such as the rights of spouses and dependants. But the EU politicians want something else. In a proposal set out earlier this month they made clear that Europeans who are living in the UK should maintain their EU rights, in perpetuity, with access to the jurisdiction on the European Court of Justice. A spokesman for Mr Tusk told me: ""EU citizens should have the same rights after Brexit as they have now."" The problem is that under the EU's proposals, EU citizens in the UK could be living within a different legal framework to UK citizens. There is also an implicit suggestion with the proposal that EU citizens won't be properly protected by British courts, which may aggravate the feelings of uncertainty that EU citizens are feeling. Mrs May said that EU nationals would have their rights ""enshrined in UK law"" and ""enforced through our highly respected courts"". While it may be a noble desire for the EU to belt and brace the rights of EU citizens who now live in the UK - their demands are perhaps unwarranted - or at least in need of explanation of why the UK courts can't be trusted. After all - they overruled the Government on Article 50. Mistrust is all part of the messy divorce proceedings and all this before we get on to the subject of money."

The pair were electrocuted when they jumped into the pool after noticing three children had suffered shocks in the water. The children were aged 12, 15, and 17, according to the Turkish NTV television channel. All five victims were rushed to a hospital, however their hearts had already stopped due to the electrocution, according to the hospital. One other individual has been admitted to hospital in the town of Akyazi with injuries. Personnel at the aqua park cut the electricity to the building. Turkish gendarmerie officials said there was no residual current device (RCD) at the aqua park after inspecting the scene. RCD is a device that instantly breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock."
2017-06-24,It was a scene that could have come from a Beatles gig in the 1960s.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170624185334/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-gets-rapturous-reception-at-glastonbury-10926081,"Teenagers in the front row lined up with ""Jezza"" written on their faces in red lipstick, and flags saying ""We heart Corbyn"" flew above the crowd of thousands who gathered rhythmically chanting ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"". The Labour leader gave a stirring and impassioned speech on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury, preaching to his core fan base, the youth. He managed to mobilise them to influence the election result, and now he's getting them all fired up at the festival. He attacked Donald Trump, sexism and the greedy and defended the poor, refugees, and women's rights, insisting peace and unity must win. The crowds lapped it up as Mr Corbyn quoted his favourite poet Shelley, shouting: ""Rise like lions after slumber in unvanquishable number. Shake your chains to earth like dew. Which in sleep had fallen on you. Ye are many-they are few."" And no wonder his poetic words received a rockstar welcome: this was the perfect PR opportunity, gifted to him by Michael Eavis, as he remains buoyant off the back of his election surge in popularity. It is an astonishing turnaround from exactly a year ago, when Mr Corbyn was forced to back out of his planned appearance here because he faced a post-Brexit coup from within the party's ranks from those desperate to oust him. But in the space of a year, Mr Corbyn's fortunes have utterly transformed and at Glastonbury Festival he was riding high on the wave of his own comeback. In queues for the toilets, in the campsite, even during headline performances, the refrain ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" echoed. Glastonbury's mostly left-leaning audience has delighted in singing the Labour leader's name. Mr Glastonbury himself, Michael Eavis, told us he was thrilled to give Mr Corbyn a platform to further celebrate his success. ""This is the man that's going to deliver on the things we've been campaigning for here,"" said the Glastonbury founder, now in his 80s. ""He's got the hearts and minds of millions of young people, that's a huge thing,"" he enthused. Singer Billy Bragg - who introduced Mr Corbyn's second speech in the Left Field - said he was proud to see how Mr Corbyn has connected with the young crowd. ""I'll let you in on a secret: I've never met a politician who didn't want to be a rockstar, but with Jeremy he has always been a part of a movement and this feels like his time. ""The election was a watershed moment ... Young people and social media played an important part. ""In the wake of the election, people feel that the tide is flowing with them, rather than against them."" Sam Coates, deputy political editor at The Times, says Mr Corbyn is on safe ground here in the Glastonbury bubble - treading in the footsteps of Tony Benn - so it is no surprise he has received a hero's welcome. He added: ""This is a crowd that couldn't be more supportive but this isn't representative of most of the electorate. ""Most people watching at home will just see this as a giant selfie in front of the Pyramid stage. ""While it goes down a storm with some, it will only reinforce the negatives with others."" But it seems thousands of people at Glastonbury fancy a little politics with their pop this year. It's not a new notion, but a resurgence of music re-engaging with the political scene. Grime stars Stormzy, Wiley and Kano have harnessed Mr Corbyn's political sentiment, referencing him in lyrics and music videos. The act Mr Corbyn introduced on the Pyramid stage, rap duo Run The Jewels, also embrace his mantra, having been politically outspoken in their homeland America. And Daniel Rachel, author of Walls Come Tumbling Down, told us he remembered the first wave of motivated artists. ""The marriage of pop and politics has not been seen for 30 or 40 years, and it's now coming back and the young vote is as important as any vote,"" said the music writer. ""Last night the crowds at Radiohead were singing Mr Corbyn's name. It was extraordinary. ""Imagine the crowd singing for Thatcher or Gordon Brown. These are extraordinary times."" True perhaps, no matter which way politically you lean."
2017-06-24,"Banksy's secret identity might have been revealed in a radio interview in which DJ Goldie referred to the artist as ""Robert"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170624185334/http://news.sky.com/story/banksys-secret-identity-who-is-robert-and-has-dj-goldie-slipped-up-10924582,"The British DJ was talking to hip hop artist Scroobius Pip on his weekly podcast on Tuesday when he was asked about graffiti art being misunderstood. ""Give me a bubble letter and put it on a t-shirt and write 'Banksy' on it and we're sorted. We can sell it now,"" Goldie, a street artist himself, told Pip. ""No disrespect to Robert, I think he is a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over."" Awkward silence, change of topic and the internet goes crazy with speculation. Now, all paths are seemingly leading back to one man: Robert Del Naja, aka 3D. The Massive Attack front man, a friend of Goldie's, had been linked to the anonymous artist in the past. But the rumours died off as Del Naja swiftly denied the claims himself, telling a crowd of fans that ""we are all Banksy"". ""No, it's not true. But it's a worthy reminder what a bunch of delinquent ecstatic transgressors Massive Attack have always been, and how it was not so long ago that such subversive voices were carried through music before migrating more fully to visual culture,"" he said. But we are not so easily put off, and have listed a few reasons why ""Robert"" could well be Del Naja. Just check out all of Massive Attack albums' cover art. Del Naja did it all and you can clearly see his roots in street art: In a rare interview, with Swindle magazine in 2008, Banksy told the story of when he first saw Del Naja's graffiti and was inspired by it. ""When I was about 10 years old, a kid called 3D was painting the street hard,"" he said. ""3D quit painting and formed the band Massive Attack, which may have been a good thing for him but was a big loss for the city."" Which takes us to... Massive Attack is a trip hop band from Bristol, formed in the late 1980s by Del Naja and Daddy G, former part of the Bristol club collective The Wild Bunch. We know Banksy's from Bristol, and his work is tightly linked to the city's underground music scene. This is perhaps the biggest clue of all. Many before me have carefully traced Banksy's steps, following his works from San Francisco to the West Bank and Naples. Glasgow journalist Craig Williams published a piece last year claiming Banksy, like the biblical Demon, is ""not one, but many"". ""What if Banksy is a group of people who have stencilling different locations both at home and abroad?,"" he asked. The theory is that Banksy is in fact a collective of Massive Attack groupies who follow the band around, painting where they go. The reasoning behind it is that wherever the group puts on a gig a Banksy mural mysteriously appears. And then there is Naples... Naples is the only Italian city where Banksy has done one of his works and, curiously enough, Del Naja's childhood teams are Bristol City... and Napoli. ""It's probably because my dad's Italian. He's a Napoli fan and was used to watching top-flight stuff,"" Del Naja told The Guardian. ""I didn't have an income back then so I couldn't go to matches and we hadn't been to see my family in Naples since I was little."" That's right: Del Naja has roots which tie him to the land of pizza. Banksy is known for his social and political critiques. Most of his visual art is aimed at big corporations, right-wing politics and consumerism. He is also in favour of a Palestinian state, having created the ""worst view in the world"" in the wall that separates Israel from the Palestinian territories. Del Naja has repeatedly refused to play concerts in Israel in a stance against the Israeli government and its policies. Convinced? If not, there are several other theories floating around. These include a couple of men who have been arrested trying to impersonate Banksy, a parking attendant at Banksy's Dismaland, a French artist with a bad reputation and Robin Gunningham, a former public school boy who criminologists at London's Queen Mary University have profiled as being the elusive artist."

But payments set to be added to consumer bills have soared from an estimated £6bn to £30bn, a NAO report said. The report added that the costs and risks to consumers have not been sufficiently considered and that it will not be known for decades whether the plant is value for money. The case for Hinkley Point has also weakened since the Government agreed key commercial terms in 2013, the NAO added. The company building the plant - which is two-thirds owned by French energy giant EDF and one-third by China General Nuclear Power Group - will receive a guaranteed price for the power it generates. But the deal for the ""strike price"" - £92.50 per megawatt/hour in 2012 prices - was agreed without competition. Falling fossil fuel costs, which reduce wholesale prices of electricity, mean the forecast for top-up payments on consumer bills have ballooned. Delays have pushed back construction of the plant, while the expected cost of low-carbon alternatives have fallen more than expected, the report found. An estimated £10-£15 will be added to the average bill up to 2030 to pay for Hinkley Point C, but that could rise if it is delayed. The report found that BEIS has not taken into account the fact that bill payers will be locked into paying for the plant after 2030, when low-carbon alternatives will be cheaper. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""The department has committed electricity consumers and taxpayers to a high cost and risky deal in a changing energy marketplace. ""Time will tell whether the deal represents value for money, but we cannot say the department has maximised the chances that it will be."" An EDF Energy spokesman said the report showed Hinkley Point C remained good value compared with alternative choices. ""Relaunching the UK nuclear new build industry at Hinkley Point C will enable costs for future projects, in particular Sizewell C, to be lower,"" he said. A BEIS spokesman said: ""Consumers won't pay a penny until Hinkley is built; it will provide clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes and creating more than 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships in the process."""
2017-06-24,Hundreds of residents of four London tower blocks have spent the night in emergency accommodation after they were told to leave their homes amid fire safety fears.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170624185334/http://news.sky.com/story/camden-evacuates-tower-block-after-grenfell-fire-10925449,"The blocks in Camden, north London, containing up to 800 households, were evacuated late last night following news that similar cladding was used on the Chalcots Estate to that which spread the Grenfell Tower fire in Kensington earlier this month. Council leader Georgia Gould said that, following checks, insulation was found to be safe but external cladding on the blocks ""was not up to the standard that we wanted and was not fire retardant"". She added that the ""really, really difficult decision"" had been made to evacuate the blocks while urgent fire safety work is completed. It is thought the work will take three to four weeks. ""We realise that this is hugely distressing for everyone affected and we will be doing all we can, alongside the London Fire Brigade and other authorities, to support our residents at this difficult time,"" Ms Gould said. ""The Grenfell fire changes everything - we need to do everything we can to keep residents safe."" Ms Gould added: ""I know this is difficult but...I don't believe we can take any risks with our residents' safety and I have to put them first. ""We know it's a scary time but we'll make sure they're safe."" Responding to mounting criticism over Camden's handling of the evacuation, Sajid Javid, the Communities and Local Government minister told Sky News: ""After the Grenfell Tower tragedy, it is vital we carry out checks and make sure people are safe. ""The the local fire safety authority found alongside the cladding problem, which is a serious problem, multiple fire safety failures, including, for example, insulation of gas pipes, fire doors missing, plywood above doors and that's what makes Camden different and why the decision was made to evacuate."" Asked why non-cladding fire risks had not been picked up in previous checks, Mr Javid said: ""I ask myself that question. These are multiple fire safety check failures. These are things ... that have nothing to do with the cladding, such as fire doors not being there, auto door closers not being there ... you even had with these towers situations where some of the internal walls were breached. ""You've asked a very good question as to why did this happen in the first place. Why, how could this building have passed fire safety checks? How could it have been given the green light when clearly there were breaches of the fire safety code?"" Mr Javid said there would have to be a long-term review of safety regulations, stating: ""That has to happen. In a country like ours, one of the richest countries in the world, in the 21st century, these kind of things absolutely should not be happening."":: NHS told to check cladding on all buildings By the early hours of Saturday many residents had been sent to a rest centre at Swiss Cottage Library before council workers allocate them accommodation in hotels or, if possible, with family and friends. Around 83 people have refused to leave their homes, according to the council. In a statement issued at 1.24am, a spokesman for Camden Council said: ""So far we have secured hundreds of hotel beds for Chalcots residents. ""We're encouraging all residents to stay with friends and family if they can, otherwise we'll provide accommodation. ""Swiss Cottage rest centre is nearing capacity so we've secured more space at the Camden Centre King's Cross. ""Specialist staff are on the ground to assist residents with care needs. Pets are also welcome at both rest centres and hotel accommodation."" The Chalcots estate has five tower blocks - four 22 storey blocks and one 18 storey block. Blashford Tower, which is the shorter block, did not have to be evacuated as initially stated. Taplow resident Shirley Phillips said she had no sleep on Friday night after she was unable to secure a place in a hotel. She told Sky News: ""They called me a few hours ago and said they had a hotel for me at the Holiday Inn in Camden Town. But when I got there they said there had been a mistake, someone else had taken the room. ""They say the earliest they can get me somewhere is tonight, but it's not 100%."" Other residents said the evacuation was an ""over-reaction"". Edward Strange said: ""We've had two fires here since the cladding was put on and both fires didn't spread so I don't see what the problem is. ""It's a complete over-reaction, it's ridiculous."" :: Where has unsafe cladding been identified? Bob O'Toole from the residents' association said he had only been told about the evacuation about an hour earlier, adding: ""We want to keep the residents safe - we don't want any more disasters"". Fire safety expert Stephen MacKenzie told Sky News: ""I think (the council has) done the sensible thing in this case. ""I'm at a loss as to why Theresa May has not convened (emergency committee) Cobra today to get emergency arrangements led by central government to support local authorities, to give the residents the necessary reassurance and address this issue."" PM: My thoughts are with residents being evacuated in Camden while their homes are made safe tonight. A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: ""London Fire Brigade have been working at the Chalcots Estate with Camden Council. Following extensive joint visits and inspections the Brigade advised that there were a number of fire safety issues in the buildings and recommended that residents should not remain in the buildings until these issues are resolved. ""Camden Council have acted on this by evacuating and providing the residents with alternative accommodation so that remedial works can go ahead as quickly as possible. ""London Fire Brigade officers will continue to work with Camden to put in place measures to improve safety for residents in these buildings."""

""We have systems in place to protect member and staff accounts and are taking the necessary steps to protect our systems.""

At the River Chess in Buckinghamshire there's no water flowing. The riverbed is dry, with cracked mud and weeds where the stream once ran. Chairman of the River Chess Association Paul Jennings said: ""This would be knee-depth crystal clear water that's come out of the chalk aquifer, with lovely fronds of weed. You have ducks and swans and all sorts of livestock in here plus fish. But we don't have that now."" It's been dried up since October, and it's not uncommon here. ""Over the last six years we've had four drying events, where there's been absolutely no water at all in this section,"" Mr Jennings said. The problem is, when rivers dry up, the wildlife leaves. The River Chess is home to kingfishers, rare water voles and several species of fish. The WWF warns 550 bodies of water in England and Wales are at risk of drying out. Its report says over-abstraction and poor management are to blame. Put simply, consumers and agriculture are taking out too much water from our rivers. The weather doesn't help either. April was one of the driest months on record, prompting fears parts of England and Wales could be heading for a drought. Tanya Steele, CEO of WWF, said: ""This can be avoided if we update the outdated way we manage the demand on our country's limited water supplies. We have already seen the impacts of a drought in some place with rivers drying up or running low. ""As we witness the effects of climate change on our weather, temporary actions simply won't do. The UK Government must urgently set out an ambitious long-term plan for the environment."" The WWF report says the Government has failed to take adequate action and is concerned long-term damage could be done to our waterways. If a severe drought was to happen, the WWF estimates it could cost the UK £1.3bn per day. A spokesman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Sky News ""We recognise the need to improve water management. That is why we are committed to reforming abstraction licensing into a simplified, modern system that is fairer and more resilient. ""The Environment Agency has already made significant changes to over 250 abstraction licences and we are examining a range of ways to further protect the environment, including legislative or regulatory changes."""

They are being murdered for just trying to live. On the edge of the old city a disused shop is an emergency room. Injured civilians targeted by Islamic State as they try to escape the fighting and the starvation are brought here. The walking survivors trudge their way up the road to safety carrying what they can. In the dilapidated shop doctors, foreign medics and volunteers struggle to deal with the influx of injured people. They are ferried here on the bonnets of humvees and in the backs of trucks. They are bundled inside. On beds the medics get to work. The floor is awash with blood. The moaning and cries of pain of the injured are only drowned out by the screams of anguish from family members outside. The most seriously wounded are put into ambulances to take them to proper hospitals. Here in the chaos of the room there is no time for anyone but the living. Those who didn't survive lie where they died, wrapped in rugs and body bags. All around the work to save life and limb goes on. The survivors are terribly traumatised. The news that loved ones died in their terrifying attempt to escape is overwhelming. A young man surrounded by bodies sits outside the shop, sobbing. ""Go and see what they are doing to the people,"" he shouts, pointing down the road to the old city. Everyone trying to leave IS areas is a target. Men, women and children. A man being treated for injuries to his back says he tried to plead with Islamic State gunmen to let him and his family go. He told them they were starving. ""I pleaded with them this morning to let us leave because we have families and children. They replied: 'You want to leave and go to the unbelievers and apostates?' ""'What apostates?' I replied. I begged them to let us leave. We were dying of hunger. ""I could tell you so many stories. Brother, they were killing us. We went to the roof of my neighbour's house and all of us tried to escape together when someone yelled at us to hurry up and then they blew themselves up. Half of my family died,"" he said. Families sit together outside resting before they continue their journey to reception centres and eventually enormous tented camps. The most remarkable thing is the resilience of the children. They chomp on bananas, safe now after weeks of hiding from the fighting. When they will return home nobody knows. In truth their homes will likely be destroyed in the battle raging to rid Mosul of Islamic State. A group of boys walk away from the shop carrying their possessions in a rug, sharing the weight between them. That is all they have got. Iraqi soldiers gun their humvees and head back towards the battle space looking for more injured. Smoke from the latest suicide bomb rises in the air. How many people are left inside isn't known but it is likely to be in the tens of thousands. Even now many will be contemplating their escape knowing some of them will not make it. This was just one day. The casualties barely stopped coming. It is like this every day in west Mosul."

In an exclusive interview, DI Hines, who heads up one of six murder squads in the West Midlands, told Sky News that police forces simply cannot cope with the work they are being asked to do because they are not properly resourced. Budget cuts imposed under the Conservative government have seen more than 19,000 police posts shed since 2010. DI Hines said: ""We really are at a point now where we can't cope with what we're expected to deal with. Sickness and mental health problems amongst my colleagues are rife. ""We've got examples of police officers who have been conveyed to hospital from work because they've had a meltdown. ""I'm aware of incidents where sergeants in our public protection units are allocating work on the basis of who is the least tearful that morning when they get to work."" The veteran officer said many forces had been forced to cancel annual leave and increase working hours following a series of high-profile major incidents. There have been four terror attacks in three months - at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, London Bridge and Finsbury Park - as well as the Grenfell Tower fire. Officers from West Midlands were sent to the capital this week to help out in the aftermath of the latest attack. DI Hines said many of his colleagues are now at breaking point. ""In the last 15 months alone, around 80 officers in the West Midlands force have been referred to the National Police Federation Welfare Support Programme,"" he said. ""Those are people who are undergoing a significant mental health crisis. ""They're experiencing suicidal thoughts and tendencies and they are at risk of doing something really serious to hurt themselves, and this is only as a result of the pressures that they are being put under."" The Government has promised that forces will not face any further budget cuts for the remainder of this Parliament, but the NPCC says the current ""flat cash"" settlement for policing means force budgets will fall in real terms. Dave Thompson, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police and the national lead on finance for the NPCC, said: ""Taking into account inflation and cost pressures, there will be less money every year for forces on top of real-terms cuts of 18% since 2010. ""Many forces are now using considerable reserves to maintain current staff numbers that, when spent, will see numbers falling even further."" In response, policing minister Nick Hurd said that police officers do ""challenging and absolutely vital"" work. ""Police funding has been protected since the Spending Review in 2015 and we will continue to ensure police forces have the resources they need to reduce crime and protect the public,"" he said. :: If you feel affected by any of the issues in this story, contact Samaritans on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org"

As well as five murders, the 45-year-old admitted five attempted murders, including against police officers. He also pleaded guilty to 23 counts of conspiracy to murder, directing terrorism and membership of a proscribed organisation. Haggarty, who worked as a police informant during the Troubles, was interviewed more than 1,000 times by detectives and 23,000 pages of transcripts were presented in evidence. His offences from 1991 to 2007 included the loyalist murders of John Harbinson, Sean McParland, Gary Convie, Eamon Fox and Sean McDermott. The charge sheet also included aiding and abetting murder, kidnap, possession of explosives, hijacking, false imprisonment, arson, intimidation and conspiracy to riot. Haggarty, who is believed to be living at a secret location outside Northern Ireland, is expected to receive a reduced sentence in exchange for his co-operation with the authorities. He may even walk free after his sentence hearing in September as he has already served three years in custody, the equivalent of a six-year sentence. Following the hearing at Belfast Crown Court, Mr Fox's son Ciaran said it was ""hard sitting in a courtroom watching a guy admitting to murdering your father"". Describing Haggarty as ""just a hitman"", Mr Fox said: ""His hands are deep in blood along with people he's going to expose and because of who he's going to expose I think it's not going to finish."" Detective Superintendent Richard Campbell said the guilty pleas marked a ""milestone"" for the victims and their families."
2017-06-24,Thousands of people have been displaced after they were evacuated from their high-rise homes in London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170624185334/http://news.sky.com/story/london-tower-block-evacuation-4000-displaced-in-camden-10925745,"Council leader Georgia Gould told Sky News she had to act after fire safety fears were raised over four tower blocks in Camden, north London. It saw 650 homes evacuated on Friday evening with less than an hour's notice. Some 83 households have refused to leave their homes and the council has warned they will be forced to leave because the building is not safe. It comes as the Government says 27 high-rise blocks of flats in 15 local authority areas have failed fire cladding safety tests in the wake of the Grenfell fire disaster. The blaze left at least 79 people dead or missing presumed dead while six people remain in hospital, two in a critical condition. In Camden Ms Gould said emotions are running high, people have been crying on her shoulder as well as shouting at her. Many residents have complained about having to leave their homes at short notice. Ms Gould explained that the council had a conversation with the London Fire Brigade at 5pm on Friday who said the buildings were unsafe. She said: ""We offered to do anything we could to keep the residents there, such as 24-hour fire wardens, I even offered to pay for fire engines, but the fire brigade said there was nothing we could do to make them safe. :: Where cladding is being tested ""Of course there have been difficulties, of course it has been distressing. Those 650 households are in different accommodation."" Ms Gould said 270 hotel rooms have been used along with 100 places in social housing within Camden and neighbouring boroughs had also been asked for support. The council announced on Saturday that people who had paid for accommodation they had organised themselves would be reimbursed. The blocks containing up to 650 households, were evacuated late on Friday night following news that similar cladding was used on the Chalcots Estate to that which spread the Grenfell Tower fire in Kensington earlier this month. Ms Gould added: ""We've had everyone - council staff, volunteers, different councillors - all coming together with the fire service to move people safely out of their accommodation. ""We are now fully focused on supporting our residents and their needs over the weekend and onwards."" Those who stayed with family or friends but now need accommodation should go to the Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre for help, the council said. The Chalcots estate has five tower blocks - four 22 storey blocks and one 18 storey block. Blashford Tower, which is the shorter block, did not have to be evacuated as initially stated. Meanwhile Birmingham Council has said they are putting sprinklers in every tower block, without delay and regardless of the cost. Responding to mounting criticism over Camden's handling of the evacuation, Sajid Javid, the Communities and Local Government minister told Sky News: ""After the Grenfell Tower tragedy, it is vital we carry out checks and make sure people are safe. ""The the local fire safety authority found alongside the cladding problem, which is a serious problem, multiple fire safety failures, including, for example, insulation of gas pipes, fire doors missing, plywood above doors and that's what makes Camden different and why the decision was made to evacuate."" Mr Javid said a review of building and safety regulations would have to be looked at. He said: ""Things have gone horribly wrong in the case of Grenfell and with the failures of safety at Camden. It's correct to think long-term about what this means for fire safety regulations, building regulations. ""These kinds of things should not have happened. But right now the immediate priority is safety. But we have to learn the lessons from this and ensure this does not happen again."" Taplow resident Shirley Phillips said she had no sleep on Friday night after she was unable to secure a place in a hotel. She told Sky News: ""They called me a few hours ago and said they had a hotel for me at the Holiday Inn in Camden Town. But when I got there they said there had been a mistake, someone else had taken the room. Those who stayed with friends/family after Chalcots evacuation but now need accommodation: please go to Swiss Cottage LeisureCentre for help ""They say the earliest they can get me somewhere is tonight, but it's not 100%."" Other residents said the evacuation was an ""over-reaction"". Edward Strange said: ""We've had two fires here since the cladding was put on and both fires didn't spread so I don't see what the problem is. ""It's a complete over-reaction, it's ridiculous.""

Speaking at one of the military events in Liverpool, Theresa May added: They do a fantastic job for us and we should be grateful to them all."" She also hailed the role of UK troops in dealing with terrorism at home and abroad. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who also attended the national event on the city's waterfront, said: ""There are some 10,000 servicemen and women who are working for us around the globe on operations or in our bases. ""They have been helping to deal with Daesh terrorism, they have been helping to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean, they have been on NATO deployments, they have been peacekeeping in South Sudan. ""All of that keeps us safer here at home."" Sir Michael went on to praise the reaction of the Army following the terror attack at the Manchester Arena, in which 22 people lost their lives. Nearly 1,000 armed troops were deployed within 12 hours of the bombing - freeing up armed police to do more patrolling. The event in Liverpool was attended by regulars, reservists, their families and veterans. It began with a gun salute, and also included a parade, displays, a ship visit and flypasts by the Red Arrows and Typhoon. More than 300 other events have been taking place around the world as part of the celebrations."

And she will have to deal with the fallout of the van attack near the Finsbury Park mosque, which she said is being treated ""as a potential terrorist attack"". In her inbox this week - a major speech on Wednesday at the start of the Queen's Speech, where she will set out her legislative programme for the next two years.MPs won't actually vote on it until 28 June, but her benches will be watching her closely - every performance a test of her mettle after her faltering response to the Grenfell Tower disaster last week.There is also the matter of the DUP confidence-and-supply deal that still needs to be nailed down. No 10 are confident that the Unionists will vote with Mrs May, giving her an expected majority of around 13 - but she has yet to reach agreement.That deal is complicated by the wider politics of Northern Ireland, amid concerns that the deal with the DUP could hamper efforts to re-establish the stalled power-sharing executive at Stormont: to that end, the Prime Minister will on Monday meet the new Irish PM Leo Varadkar in Downing Street.""We will discuss Northern Ireland and the need to re-establish devolved Government, and Brexit, focusing on how we can avoid any adverse impact on the rights and freedoms of our citizens, on trade and the economy,"" Mr Varadkar said ahead of his bilateral meeting. Then, of course, is the start of Brexit talks, the Tories' fragile peace holding over the weekend after her Chancellor confirmed that there would be no rowing back on the promise to leave the single market and customs union. But those tensions will no doubt rise once more when the tussles over Britain's EU exit bill and the future deal begin in earnest. :: Labour claims Brexit 'disarray' on eve of talks in BrusselsHer MPs are in no doubt of her shortcomings - revealed in full technicolour during the election campaign, and then again last week when she initially failed to meet survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. ""Everyone knows she's not Mrs Emotional in public,"" said one minister, adding that they thought she had the support of most of her party still.But the stories about whether it's time for Mrs May to go - and who might replace her - won't dissipate. There are suggestions that once leader contender David Davis might be put up as a caretaker Prime Minister, rather as Michael Howard was back in 2004. There's talk of a ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge if she waters down Brexit - though there is no sign so far that she intends to do that.Another senior party figure said allies of Boris Johnson were taking soundings from colleagues, which was playing quite badly with some MPs who are adamant that further Tory infighting would play badly with the public. ""She's the only show in town,"" said the MP. ""The public don't want to see us knifing each other.""Mr Johnson's team insist any suggestion he's on manoeuvres is ""completely false"". ""Boris is supporting the Prime Minister and anyone doing this sort of thing is not acting with his knowledge or support,"" they say.While some in the party believe the Prime Minister is now a busted flush, opinion seems to be coalescing around the view that now is not the right time to change leader. As Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, put it on Sunday: ""I think what the country needs now is a period of calm while we get on with the job in hand. ""We've got one very serious issues to address, including the Brexit negotiations just starting. Theresa is leading the Government and I think the Government needs to get on with its job. ""And do you know what? I think actually that's what most people in this country will think - that the Government just needs to get on with the day job of Government.""Getting on with the job has become her new mantra as grand designs give way to hand-to-mouth survival. How long she stays in No 10 depends on her party, but for most MPs her continued leadership remains the least worst option - for now."

Some of the buildings where problem cladding has been identified include: Chalcots estate, Swiss Cottage, central London Camden Council says it will remove cladding from five towers after tests raised concerns about its safety. Council leader Georgia Gould told Sky News the authority believed fireproof panels were installed during a 2006 refurbishment, but that proved ""not to be the case"". Until the cladding is removed, council staff will carry out round-the-clock fire safety patrols on the estate's corridors. The company in charge of fitting the cladding to the affected Camden towers oversaw the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, according to its website. Rivers Apartments, Tottenham, north London Newlon Housing Trust said the 22-storey tower block was fitted with the same cladding reportedly used on Grenfell Tower. However, following an ""extensive safety audit"", London Fire Brigade said it would be considered a ""low fire risk"" after modifications and technical clarifications.Village 135 development, Wythenshawe, Manchester Staff from the Wythenshawe Community Housing Group are removing 78 ""failed"" panels from a small area of the development. Greater Manchester Fire Service said its fire risk audit of the site concluded the building ""is safe for all residents"". It added: ""We are happy with WCHG's active and passive fire systems"". Mount Wise Tower Estate, Plymouth The outer layer of cladding on three 16-storey blocks was found to be aluminium coated with a polyethylene core, which has the lowest fire rating score. Plymouth Community Homes says it is removing the panels and security teams are monitoring the blocks 24/7. It is also installing heat detectors in every flat and sprinkler systems in each tower. Pendleton, Salford Cladding on nine high-rise blocks has been identified as being made from aluminium composite material (ACM), which was used on Grenfell Tower. Samples are being sent to the Department for Communities and Local Government to be tested independently by fire experts. Pendleton Together, the management company that runs the blocks, said questions about the cladding were a ""real concern"" for residents. The firm said every householder in a high-rise block would have a home visit to carry out basic fire safety checks on doors and smoke alarms Patrols of the buildings are also being carried out ""as a precautionary safety measure"". Braithwaite House, Islington, central London ACM was also detected in cladding fitted to this high-rise and Islington Council says the panels are to be removed. Test results from the other blocks, Harvist Estate and Brunswick Estate, are yet to be returned, the council said. Ferrier Point, Newham, east London The tower was reportedly found to have cladding panels with ACM. Refurbishment of the building, including cladding, was overseen by Rydon, the company involved in the refit of Grenfell Tower. However, the insulation behind the cladding was said to be highly fire-resistant Rockwool Duoslab. Two other buildings in the borough are also said to have ACM cladding, Newham Council said. ""We are following the process as set out by DCLG for sample testing of buildings with ACM cladding,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Once the results are known, we will take whatever action is necessary to ensure our residents are safe. Barnet, north London Three towers were found to have similar rain screen panels on their cladding as Grenfell Tower, but a non-combustible insulation material. Granville Point, Harpenmead Point and Templemead Point blocks were all reclad in 2012, Barnet Council said. Samples have been sent to the Government. Horatia House and Leamington House, Portsmouth Cladding fitted to the two high-rises is being removed after tests revealed a fire risk. Portsmouth City Council deputy leader Luke Stubbs said round-the-clock fire patrols have been put in place and firefighters have carried out a full assessment. He said: ""The buildings are safe to stay in with all of the existing safety measures still in place."" Halifax Independent contractors are checking three blocks in Lower Mixenden, a village outside Halifax. Samples of cladding from Jumples Court, Mixenden Court and Wheatley Court are being sent to the Government. However, Together Housing said initial visual inspection suggests it is not the same type as that used on Grenfell Tower. Harold Lambert Court, Sheffield The high-rise is being checked by management firm, Together Housing, with cladding samples sent off for analysis."
2017-06-24,NHS Trusts have been told to urgently check their buildings to establish whether any are clad in materials implicated in the the Grenfell Tower fire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170624185334/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-trusts-told-to-check-buildings-for-combustible-cladding-10925385,"Regulator NHS Improvement has written to around 200 Trusts in England asking them to report back when safety checks have been completed. In a letter sent on Monday, they asked Trusts to pay particular attention to tall buildings on hospital estates and those with in-patients - and to report back within 24 hours. Fourteen high rise blocks across nine local authorities have been identified as having potentially combustible cladding since the fire at the Grenfell Tower, which is believed to have killed at least 79 people. About 600 tower blocks identified as being clad in plastic materials are being tested and those found to have flammable cladding or insulation may have to be evacuated and the material removed. Police said on Friday that the cladding on the high rise building failed safety tests, but the insulation on the block was even more highly more flammable. The letter from NHS Improvement asked Trusts to detail what type of cladding is used on all buildings on their estates, including those built under Private Finance Initiative (PFI) deals; which contractors carried out the work; how many storeys buildings have; whether in-patients are present; and if any risk assessment has been carried out in the last year. The director of estates and facilities told Trusts he needed the information in order to allow the regulator to target assistance at hospitals that may need it. An extract of the letter from Simon Corden, published by Health Service Journal, reads: ""We do need to take all reasonable precautionary measures and be ready to rapidly implement any recommendations that come from the findings of the ongoing investigations."" Downing Street has said a testing facility being used to check council and housing association buildings is also available to the owners of private blocks and they are being encouraged to use it. Premier Inn has said it is ""concerned"" about whether cladding on some of its hotels meets safety standards - but added that it is not the same material as that on Grenfell Tower."

""I can only deeply apologise from the bottom of my heart. This has been an extremely sad and humbling experience."" The International Tennis Federation was preparing a statement and will now decide Evans' punishment.

But the photographs released by the US European Command on Friday showed just how close the fighter jet came to the US aircraft. NATO aircraft are being deployed as part of the organisation's annual Baltic Operations (BALTOPS), a multinational, maritime-focused live training event which first began in 1972, in the region close to Russia's border. Referring to the 19 June incident, the US military said that ""due to the high rate of closure speed and poor control of the aircraft during the intercept, this interaction was determined to be unsafe"". But according to the Russian news agency TASS, it was the RC-135 plane which ""made an attempt at approaching the Russian fighter jet making a provocative turn towards it"". CNN reported that there have been more than 30 interactions between US and Russian aircraft near the Baltic Sea since in recent weeks, most of which were ""safe and professional"" according to a US official. ""The vast majority of interactions we have, intercepts that occur when we fly and that are intercepted by the Russians are safe,"" said a Pentagon spokesperson. ""This is an exception, not the norm, but we were again operating in international airspace and did nothing to provoke,"" they added."
2017-06-24,Some 27 high-rise residential blocks have failed fire safety tests because of the cladding used on them.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170624185334/http://news.sky.com/story/tower-block-cladding-27-buildings-fail-fire-safety-tests-10925792,"The towers in 15 council areas were identified as part of a national operation to identify at-risk buildings in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster. The local authority areas with buildings that failed tests include Manchester, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Hounslow, Brent and Camden. The Government has said it is not identifying other areas until residents have been notified, so as not to cause undue concern. Test results are being sent to local landlords and fire services, with councils to decide on what course of action is needed and to inform residents. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the failed tests as a ""nationwide threat"" as he urged the Prime Minister to convene the Government's emergency committee to provide a ""national response"". Thousands have already been evacuated from their homes in Camden, north London, although other local authorities will make their own decisions based on the nature of their area's housing stock. Brent Council leader Muhammed Butt told Sky News the high-rise block in his area that failed the Government's fire safety test has been checked by the fire service and evacuation was not deemed necessary. Cladding has been removed on two Portsmouth tower blocks after being found to be a fire risk, although local officials insisted the buildings were still safe for residents to stay in. The Prime Minister said it is possible for some councils to take ""mitigating action"" on tower blocks, but in other cases it had been necessary to move people out. Speaking at an event celebrating Armed Forces Day in Liverpool, Theresa May revealed ""it wasn't just a question of the cladding"" but ""a number of other issues"" with the Camden tower blocks that concerned the fire service. The Prime Minister said the Government would ensure councils take ""immediate action"" over the failed tests, adding: ""Absolutely our first priority is people's safety."" Local authorities and the Government are together ""making sure the resources are there to ensure what is needed to keep people safe is being done"", including finding alternative accommodation for those told to leave their homes, Mrs May said. In a statement, Mr Corbyn, who is at Glastonbury Festival, said: ""Tower blocks across the country have now failed fire safety tests in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster. ""This is now a nationwide threat and the Prime Minister needs to get a grip and lead a national response, including convening the Cobra committee to coordinate Government and public action. ""I urge the Government to make sure all necessary support - including, crucially, financial support - is urgently made available to councils across the country so they can deal swiftly and effectively with the scale of the fire safety challenge."" Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid had earlier said the Government will help local authorities with funding for any action they do take. It comes as the manufacturer of the insulation used to clad Grenfell Tower said they would stop using the product on high-rise buildings. Celotex, which makes the RS5000 insulation boards in the tower's rainscreen cladding, insisted no building over 18m tall would be fitted with the material. At least 79 people are feared to have died after the west London tower block was engulfed by a huge fire ten days ago. Six people are still being treated by three London hospitals following the disaster, with two in critical care, NHS England said. By Saturday morning, more than £1.2m of government money had been distributed to those affected by the blaze as part of support measures. Work has also begun on installing a temporary boiler after the one that served Grenfell Tower and surrounding properties was completely destroyed. The Government announced suppliers have agreed to write off outstanding utility bills for victims of the fire. Labour has stepped up its attack on the Government over the tragedy, with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott claiming the victims died as ""a direct consequence of Tory attitudes in social housing"". She argued the Conservatives saw social housing residents as ""second-class citizens"". In Camden, 650 homes were evacuated from the Chalcots Estate with less than an hour's notice on Friday evening, following a meeting between council officials and the London Fire Brigade. Residents expressed their anger at the short time they were given to vacate their homes. The council said 83 households refused to leave. Along with local councils, NHS Trusts have also been told to urgently check their buildings to establish whether they are clad in materials used on Grenfell Tower."

Founding partners behind the initiative include the Jo Cox Foundation, set up in memory of the murdered MP, as well as anti-hate groups from the Jewish and Muslim communities. The OCCI will be used to share experience, Facebook said, and will lead to awareness campaigns and better ""counterspeech"" to fight extremism. Internet companies have been under increasing pressure from the Government over their role in the spread of hate speech. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the Government was ""not frightened"" to sanction firms who fail to remove extreme material. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said: ""There is no place for hate or violence on Facebook. ""We use technology like AI to find and remove terrorist propaganda, and we have teams of counterterrorism experts and reviewers around the world working to keep extremist content off our platform."" The OCCI has already launched in Germany and France. Fiyaz Mughal, founder of anti-Muslim hatred company Tell Mama which is an OCCI founding partner, said: ""This initiative is much needed given that a vast amount of material online may be insulting and sometimes inflammatory, though it may not cross a legal threshold for action. ""This means that civil society mobilisation is needed as counter-speech to tackle such texts, language and ideologies. ""We are in a battle for hearts and minds and this initiative is one tool in mobilising the enormous force for good that is in communities."""

He attacked Donald Trump, sexism and the greedy and defended the poor, refugees, and women's rights, insisting peace and unity must win. The crowds lapped it up as Mr Corbyn quoted his favourite poet Shelley, shouting: ""Rise like lions after slumber in unvanquishable number. Shake your chains to earth like dew. Which in sleep had fallen on you. Ye are many-they are few."" And no wonder his poetic words received a rockstar welcome: this was the perfect PR opportunity, gifted to him by Michael Eavis, as he remains buoyant off the back of his election surge in popularity. It is an astonishing turnaround from exactly a year ago, when Mr Corbyn was forced to back out of his planned appearance here because he faced a post-Brexit coup from within the party's ranks from those desperate to oust him. But in the space of a year, Mr Corbyn's fortunes have utterly transformed and at Glastonbury Festival he was riding high on the wave of his own comeback. In queues for the toilets, in the campsite, even during headline performances, the refrain ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" echoed. Glastonbury's mostly left-leaning audience has delighted in singing the Labour leader's name. Mr Glastonbury himself, Michael Eavis, told us he was thrilled to give Mr Corbyn a platform to further celebrate his success. ""This is the man that's going to deliver on the things we've been campaigning for here,"" said the Glastonbury founder, now in his 80s. ""He's got the hearts and minds of millions of young people, that's a huge thing,"" he enthused. Singer Billy Bragg - who introduced Mr Corbyn's second speech in the Left Field - said he was proud to see how Mr Corbyn has connected with the young crowd. ""I'll let you in on a secret: I've never met a politician who didn't want to be a rockstar, but with Jeremy he has always been a part of a movement and this feels like his time. ""The election was a watershed moment ... Young people and social media played an important part. ""In the wake of the election, people feel that the tide is flowing with them, rather than against them."" Sam Coates, deputy political editor at The Times, says Mr Corbyn is on safe ground here in the Glastonbury bubble - treading in the footsteps of Tony Benn - so it is no surprise he has received a hero's welcome. He added: ""This is a crowd that couldn't be more supportive but this isn't representative of most of the electorate. ""Most people watching at home will just see this as a giant selfie in front of the Pyramid stage. ""While it goes down a storm with some, it will only reinforce the negatives with others."" But it seems thousands of people at Glastonbury fancy a little politics with their pop this year. It's not a new notion, but a resurgence of music re-engaging with the political scene. Grime stars Stormzy, Wiley and Kano have harnessed Mr Corbyn's political sentiment, referencing him in lyrics and music videos. The act Mr Corbyn introduced on the Pyramid stage, rap duo Run The Jewels, also embrace his mantra, having been politically outspoken in their homeland America. And Daniel Rachel, author of Walls Come Tumbling Down, told us he remembered the first wave of motivated artists. ""The marriage of pop and politics has not been seen for 30 or 40 years, and it's now coming back and the young vote is as important as any vote,"" said the music writer. ""Last night the crowds at Radiohead were singing Mr Corbyn's name. It was extraordinary. ""Imagine the crowd singing for Thatcher or Gordon Brown. These are extraordinary times."" True perhaps, no matter which way politically you lean."

She was rushed to hospital after plummeting from the gondola ride but is in a stable condition with no serious injuries. The girl, from Delaware, was in one of the ride's two-person cars with another child, a relative of hers, when it was stopped by an operator following a report someone was in distress, officials said. After falling from the car, the girl struck a tree before landing in the crowd of park guests and employees, who had gathered below in a bid to catch her. The teenager was treated by park staff before being taken to a local hospital by ambulance and then airlifted to Albany Medical Centre, 55 miles away. A 47-year-old man was treated at hospital for a back injury he suffered while attempting to catch the falling teen. The ride has been closed in order to carry out safety checks but officials said it appeared to be working properly. The park said: ""There does not appear to be any malfunction of the ride, but we have closed the attraction until a thorough review can be completed."""

Some £20bn a year of goods are shipped to the UK from these countries, accounting for around half of UK clothing, and a quarter of UK coffee. The Government said that once it has left the EU in 2019 it will explore options to expand trade relations further. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said: ""Our departure from the EU is an opportunity to step up to our commitments to the rest of the world, not step away from them. ""Free and fair trade has been the greatest liberator of the world's poor, and today's announcement shows our commitment to helping developing countries grow their economies and reduce poverty through trade. ""Behind the 'duty-free exports' are countless stories of people in developing countries working hard to provide for themselves and their families by exporting everyday goods such as cocoa, bananas and roses, resulting in lower prices and greater choice for consumers."" The Fairtrade Foundation's Tim Aldred welcomed the Government's pledge to increase trade with developing countries in a number of areas. He said: ""We are very pleased to hear today's commitments to guarantee and strengthen the position of the least developed countries who provide such a high quantity of the goods sold in our supermarkets and high streets. ""The position of poor countries just outside the 'least developed country' category, such as Kenya, will need to be clarified. ""Government will also need to take care that large deals with emerging economies do not push out the sales from the poorest countries."""

It was travelling from the southern port city of Karachi to Lahore when the driver lost control and it crashed near the city of Bahawalpur. Some reports suggested the tanker had suffered a burst tyre. Police had tried to seal off the area but became overwhelmed by the scores of people trying to reach the vehicle. Dr Rizwan Naseer, rescue services chief for the Punjab, the country's second largest province, said many of the victims were beyond recognition and that the death toll was likely to rise. ""At least 123 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded in a fire which erupted after an oil tanker turned over and victims rushed to collect spilt fuel,"" senior local government official Rana Mohammad Saleem Afzal told state television. He said residents were told about the leaking oil tanker over a loudspeaker at a local mosque. ""After about 10 minutes the tanker exploded in a huge fireball and enveloped the people collecting petrol. It was not clear how the fire started,"" said regional police chief Raja Riffat. ""According to the initial reports, somebody tried to light a cigarette. The spilt fuel caught fire, leading to the tanker's explosion,"" Jam Sajjad Hussain, spokesman for the rescue services, added. Those seriously injured in the explosion were airlifted to nearby hospitals by army helicopters. Flames and large plumes of thick, black smoke could be seen from a distance as firefighters battled the blaze for two hours. Witnesses described seeing the charred ruins of up to 30 motorbikes that had carried residents to the crash site. Almost a dozen other nearby vehicles were also destroyed by the blaze. The tragedy happened on the eve of Eid ul-Fitr celebrations marking the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan in Pakistan. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed his grief and ordered provincial leaders to ensure victims received ""full medical assistance"".

The areas named so far include Barnet, Brent, Camden, Doncaster, Hounslow, Islington, Lambeth, Manchester, Norwich, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Stockton on Tees, Sunderland and Wandsworth. The Government has said it is not identifying the other areas until residents have been notified, so as not to cause undue concern. Some of the buildings where problem cladding has been identified include: Chalcots estate, Swiss Cottage, central London On Friday, authorities ordered the evacuation of four tower blocks following safety concerns over cladding, fire doors, gas pipes and external insulation. However, around 200 residents from 120 homes have refused to leave, according to Camden Council leader Georgia Gould. Ms Gould told Sky News the authority believed fireproof panels were installed during a 2006 refurbishment, but that proved ""not to be the case"". The company in charge of fitting the cladding to the affected Camden towers oversaw the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, according to its website. Rivers Apartments, Tottenham, north London Newlon Housing Trust said the 22-storey tower block was fitted with the same cladding reportedly used on Grenfell Tower. However, following an ""extensive safety audit"", London Fire Brigade said it would be considered a ""low fire risk"" after modifications and technical clarifications.Village 135 development, Wythenshawe, Manchester Staff from the Wythenshawe Community Housing Group are removing 78 ""failed"" panels from a small area of the development. Greater Manchester Fire Service said its fire risk audit of the site concluded the building ""is safe for all residents"". It added: ""We are happy with WCHG's active and passive fire systems"". Mount Wise Tower Estate, Plymouth The outer layer of cladding on three 16-storey blocks was found to be aluminium coated with a polyethylene core, which has the lowest fire rating score. Plymouth Community Homes says it is removing the panels and security teams are monitoring the blocks 24/7. It is also installing heat detectors in every flat and sprinkler systems in each tower. Pendleton, Salford Cladding on nine high-rise blocks has been identified as being made from aluminium composite material (ACM), which was used on Grenfell Tower. Samples are being sent to the Department for Communities and Local Government to be tested independently by fire experts. Pendleton Together, the management company that runs the blocks, said questions about the cladding were a ""real concern"" for residents. The firm said every householder in a high-rise block would have a home visit to carry out basic fire safety checks on doors and smoke alarms Patrols of the buildings are also being carried out ""as a precautionary safety measure"". Braithwaite House, Islington, central London ACM was also detected in cladding fitted to this high-rise and Islington Council says the panels are to be removed. Test results from the other blocks, Harvist Estate and Brunswick Estate, are yet to be returned, the council said. Ferrier Point, Newham, east London The tower was reportedly found to have cladding panels with ACM. Refurbishment of the building, including cladding, was overseen by Rydon, the company involved in the refit of Grenfell Tower. However, the insulation behind the cladding was said to be highly fire-resistant Rockwool Duoslab. Two other buildings in the borough are also said to have ACM cladding, Newham Council said. ""We are following the process as set out by DCLG for sample testing of buildings with ACM cladding,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Once the results are known, we will take whatever action is necessary to ensure our residents are safe. Clements Court, Hounslow, west London Outer cladding on the high-rise failed a fire safety test and will be removed ""as soon as possible"", Hounslow Council said. The authority says a fire watch patrol will be set up and homes will undergo safety tests. Barnet, north London Three towers were found to have similar rain screen panels on their cladding as Grenfell Tower, but a non-combustible insulation material. Granville Point, Harpenmead Point and Templemead Point blocks were all reclad in 2012, Barnet Council said. Samples have been sent to the Government. Denning Point, Tower Hamlets, east London Cladding ""did not fully comply with the requirements"" of safety tests, Tower Hamlets Council said. The building is covered by the fire retardant version of ACM panels, according to a joint statement from the council and owners EastendHomes. Communal areas are being patrolled 24/7. Castlemaine Tower, Battersea, south west London Officials found external cladding did not meet fire safety standards and it is being removed ""as soon as possible"", Wandsworth Council says. However, London Fire Brigade concluded the building was safe for residents following an ""exhaustive"" inspection. The council said more than 100 high-rise housing blocks are being fitted with sprinkler systems. It added that samples taken from Sudbury House, Wandsworth High Street, are also being tested. Horatia House and Leamington House, Portsmouth Cladding fitted to the two high-rises is being removed after tests revealed a fire risk. Portsmouth City Council deputy leader Luke Stubbs said round-the-clock fire patrols have been put in place and firefighters have carried out a full assessment. He said: ""The buildings are safe to stay in with all of the existing safety measures still in place."" Silverwood House, Doncaster Window capping is being removed after it was found to have fire retardant, not fire resistant, properties. Doncaster Council chief executive Jo Miller said the decision was made ""to reflect that the health and safety of residents is our main priority"". Halifax Independent contractors are checking three blocks in Lower Mixenden, a village outside Halifax. Samples of cladding from Jumples Court, Mixenden Court and Wheatley Court are being sent to the Government. However, Together Housing said initial visual inspection suggests it is not the same type as that used on Grenfell Tower. Harold Lambert Court, Sheffield The high-rise is being checked by management firm, Together Housing, with cladding samples sent off for analysis."

As well as five murders, the 45-year-old admitted five attempted murders, including against police officers. He also pleaded guilty to 23 counts of conspiracy to murder, directing terrorism and membership of a proscribed organisation. Haggarty, who worked as a police informant during the Troubles, was interviewed more than 1,000 times by detectives and 23,000 pages of transcripts were presented in evidence. His offences from 1991 to 2007 included the loyalist murders of John Harbinson, Sean McParland, Gary Convie, Eamon Fox and Sean McDermott. The charge sheet also included aiding and abetting murder, kidnap, possession of explosives, hijacking, false imprisonment, arson, intimidation and conspiracy to riot. Haggarty, who is believed to be living at a secret location outside Northern Ireland, is expected to receive a reduced sentence in exchange for his co-operation with the authorities. He may even walk free after his sentence hearing in September as he has already served three years in custody, the equivalent of a six-year sentence. Following the hearing at Belfast Crown Court, Mr Fox's son Ciaran said it was ""hard sitting in a courtroom watching a guy admitting to murdering your father"". Describing Haggarty as ""just a hitman"", Mr Fox said: ""His hands are deep in blood along with people he's going to expose and because of who he's going to expose I think it's not going to finish."" Detective Superintendent Richard Campbell said the guilty pleas marked a ""milestone"" for the victims and their families."

While the attack has now been contained, preliminary investigations suggest that there may have been a compromise of a large number of emails. The investigation by Parliament's digital security team is ongoing, but it currently speculates that ""significantly fewer than 1% of the 9,000 accounts on the parliamentary network"" have been compromised in the attack. Those 9,000 accounts belong not only to senior ministers and other MPs and peers, but also to their staffers and to many civil servants. Sky Sources have suggested that dozens of accounts have been identified as compromised at the moment. It is not yet known whose accounts may have been compromised or who was behind the attack. Government ministers are expected to carry out confidential work from their departmental email accounts. These are hosted on the gov.uk domain, rather than their parliamentary accounts which are hosted on the parliament.uk domain. Following publication of this article, a parliamentary spokesperson stated that the accounts which have been compromised ""did not conform to guidance issued by the Parliamentary Digital Service"" regarding password strength. They added that as the affected accounts are identified, the individuals who operate them are being contacted and additional investigations will be conducted to identify whether any data had been stolen. An earlier statement described the attack involving hackers ""carrying out a sustained and determined attack on all parliamentary user accounts in an attempt to identify weak passwords"". Sky sources have confirmed that the attack was not targeted against particular accounts, but rather attempted to probe the email server used by Parliament. ""Parliament's first priority has been to protect the parliamentary network and systems from the sustained and determined cyber attack to ensure that the business of the Houses can continue,"" added the parliamentary spokesperson. ""This has been achieved and both Houses will meet as planned tomorrow."" More follows..."

Grenfell: 60 high-rise blocks fail fire safety tests Friday night's forced evacuation of the high rise blocks was sudden and traumatic for their occupants - and for that Ms Gould apologised. At celebrations to mark Eid in the nearby Leisure Centre, she told a gathering of dozens of Chalcots residents that she was sorry for the disruption and stress the evacuation had caused. Ms Gould said that the council was left with no choice after the London Fire brigade declared the blocks unsafe. The council leader said she was determined to try to convince remaining residents to leave, but if some still refused, the council would have to take action to remove them. Mahdi Addihakim returned with his mother to pick up their belongings from their apartment in the Taplow block, before heading back to the hotel room which is now home to five of them. He told me his family were just fed up, that they desperately wanted to go home, but had no idea when that might be. Ms Gould told us it was hoped the work to remedy the tower block's safety issues would be completed within a month. :: Where have the safety inspections failed? Carl McDowell lives on the 4th floor of Taplow. He's now returned to his flat, unable to stand another night sleeping on an airbed in the leisure centre. He told us he would be willing to move into temporary accommodation, but the council had not yet responded to his calls. ""Yes, I'm still waiting and waiting to see if they're going to find us anywhere decent to go before they kick us out of here,"" he said. In a sequence filmed inside his flat on his mobile phone, Mr McDowell said: ""The house is just where it was when we evacuated. I've been back in the house and packed a suitcase, ready and waiting to leave. ""Still haven't heard anything so who knows what they're doing. ""I've called the council number multiple times and they still haven't got back to me. Just waiting to get on out of the place so they can get on doing the work."" Some 60 tower block residents spent a second night at the Swiss Cottage leisure centre. The council said it hoped most would be found temporary accommodation before having to spend a third night there. At the foot of Bray Tower, I met Raj Want Ludher, who has lived in a 7th floor flat here for 30 years. She told me she was determined she would not be leaving, that she had no family to go and live with and that she felt perfectly safe in the tower block. For Camden council officials, it will be a tricky few days ahead, trying to gently coax unwilling residents like Raj Want to leave their homes and desperately hoping they do not have to resort to tougher measures."

He writes in a newspaper article: ""The future of this country is not a zero-sum, winner takes all, calculation but must rest on the reconciled common good arrived at through good debate and disagreement."" He adds: ""We must develop a forum or commission or some political tool which can hold the ring for the differences to be fought out, so that a commonly agreed negotiating aim is achieved. ""Obviously it would be under the authority of Parliament, especially the Commons. It would need to be cross-party and chaired by a senior politician, on Privy Council terms. ""It could not bind Parliament, but well-structured it could draw much of the poison from the debate."" Archbishop Welby voted to Remain in last year's referendum and warned last June against ""succumbing to our worst instincts"" over immigration and of economic damage, which he feared would hit the poorest. In The Mail on Sunday, he writes that ""recent events have highlighted the urgent need for a process of internal reconciliation, between regions, social groups, faiths and generations."" In the light of the hung parliament widely thought to have weakened Mrs May's negotiating hand, he writes: ""Brexit continues to divide us. ""Exit negotiations will be fierce and the differences on what we should aim for, and how, are very deep. ""With a hung parliament, there is an understandable temptation for every difference to become a vote of confidence, a seeking of momentary advantage ahead of the next election. ""For that to happen would be a disaster if our negotiators, faced with the united determination of the EU, go into the room without confidence in their backing in the UK. ""It might turn us inwards and forfeit the opportunity to be a country the world admires and blesses for our generosity and vision. Politics is rightly hard and tough. ""We must not pretend otherwise. But for Brexit, we need the politicians to find a way of neutralising the temptation to take minor advantage domestically from these great events."" Labour politicians including Yvette Cooper and Harriet Harman, as well as Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, have already called for cross-party cooperation over Brexit. A YouGov poll earlier this month suggested 51% of voters would also be in favour. The calls have been backed by business leaders and even by former Tory leader William Hague, who said other parties should be allowed a say. Although many in his party would be reluctant, Lord Hague also called for the Government to modify its negotiating objectives so that securing economic growth takes priority over controlling immigration."

Some of them he describes as ""completely deranged"" and suggests that certain long-standing eurosceptics thought Boris Johnson shouldn't be encouraged to join the campaign.eurosceptics Mr Cummings, who was campaign director for Vote Leave, has kept a low profile since the referendum result, but in this rare interview he says the eurosceptic movement attracted ""a particularly unbalanced set of people"". He said: ""The eurosceptic world is a very old world populated by very odd people. Gener­ally, not always but generally, the longer they have been involved in it, the higher the probability that they will be odd. ""There's a sort of self-perpetuating cycle - the kind of people who are likely to take opinions against a long-running establishment tend to be quite contrary character. By definition, it is quite hard to coordinate their actions, and the cumulative effect psychologically of being called 'nutters' and excluded from things means they become more eccentric over time - that's my experience."" Mr Cummings claims there was a great deal of jealousy in his camp about who would get to appear in the big TV debates; certain MPs didn't even want Mr Johnson joining the campaign and stealing the limelight. He believes the people who'd been the backbone of the eurosceptic movement for 20 years, such as Bill Cash, John Redwood and Bernard Jenkin, felt they were being side-lined and in January, just as Mr Cummings was close to lining up Michael Gove and Mr Johnson to join Vote Leave, those MPs launched a coup to get rid of him. Mr Cummings says: ""Some of them were completely deranged: Bernard, for example, hated the idea of Boris coming on board and said repeatedly in Vote Leave board meetings, 'Dominic is wrong to be going off on the secret meetings to meet Boris Johnson, he will be nothing but a negative to the campaign.' ""That's the degree of craziness we were having to deal with. I'd say: 'Who should be on? John Redwood, right? So you really think we're going to win this campaign by excluding the most pop­ular politician in Britain, and putting John Redwood on TV more? Sorry, we're going to do things differently."" He believes the selec­tion processes and the incentive structures within parties mean that the wrong kind of people are attracted to becoming MPs, who ""to a large extent are not particularly bright, are egomaniacs and they want to be on TV."" Mr Cummings carried on campaign director for the remainder of the campaign and was credited with its main slogan ""Take back control""."

Speaking during a debate at the Somerset festival's Left Field, organised by musician Billy Bragg, Mr McDonnell said: ""Is democracy working? It didn't work if you were a family living on the 20th floor of Grenfell Tower. ""Those families, those individuals - 79 so far and there will be more - were murdered by political decisions that were taken over recent decades. ""The decision not to build homes and to view housing as only for financial speculation rather than for meeting a basic human need made by politicians over decades murdered those families. ""The decision to close fire stations and to cut 10,000 firefighters and then to freeze their pay for over a decade contributed to those deaths inevitably and they were political decisions."" The comments threaten another political row, after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson previously attacked ""outrageous politicking"" by Labour amid the fallout from the Grenfell disaster. Great to be at #Glastonbury 2017 speaking on the Left Field stage. Thanks @billybragg for inviting me. pic.twitter.com/gL9LOmIV63 Mr McDonnell also said he and left-wing ally Jeremy Corbyn had been ""beating our heads against a brick wall for 30 years"" but were now on ""the edge of a huge victory"". He told supporters to prepare for another general election ""any day"" and predicted Labour would secure a majority when voters return to the ballot box. If the party wins power it will scrap the 2016 Trade Union Act and flood the House of Lords with 1,000 new peers to vote on the unelected chamber's future, Mr McDonnell vowed. Mr McDonnell appeared at Glastonbury a day after Labour leader Mr Corbyn spoke from the festival's main Pyramid Stage, marked by crowds chanting his name. The pair are among a number of Labour politicians attending this year's event, including deputy leader Tom Watson, former work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper and her husband, former shadow chancellor Ed Balls."

In an interview for the Mail on Sunday, Harry said the time he spent in the Army was ""the best escape I've ever had"". ""I felt as though I was really achieving something,"" he said. ""I have a deep understanding of all sorts of people from different backgrounds and felt I was part of a team. ""I wasn't a prince, I was just Harry."" He said he felt ""very resentful"" when his position was leaked and he had to be hastily withdrawn for security reasons. The Prince said he once considered giving up his title. ""I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself,"" he said. Harry, who in recent years has dedicated much of his time to charitable causes, said he and his brother, Prince William, ""don't want to be just a bunch of celebrities but instead use our role for good"". ""We are incredibly passionate with our charities and they have been chosen because they are on the path shown to me by our mother,"" he said. He, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, were among the first to donate to a fund for victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster. Mental health has become an important cause for the young royal who in April revealed that he had sought help after he ""shut down"" his emotions following Princess Diana's death in a road accident in 1997. In an interview with Newsweek magazine earlier this week, Harry hinted at a lingering resentment about what he was asked to do at his mother Princess Diana's funeral in 1997, when he was just 12. ""My mother had just died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television,"" he said. ""I don't think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances. I don't think it would happen today."""

The number rose from 34 tower blocks in 17 local authorities - and hundreds more authorities have yet to be tested. Officials are conducting inspections across the country after at least 79 people are believed to have been killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London this month. The tower's cladding is widely blamed for spreading the blaze quickly up the building's 24 storeys. Fourteen areas where the tests failed have been identified, with eleven yet to be named. :: Where have the safety inspections failed? Doncaster, Norwich, Stockton-on-Tees and Sunderland all had buildings that failed tests, the department said. Manchester, Plymouth and Portsmouth have already been named. In London, Islington, Lambeth and Wandsworth joined a list that already included Barnet, Brent, Camden and Hounslow. The Department for Communities said in a statement: ""All landlords and fire and rescue services for these local authorities have been alerted to the results and we are in touch with all of them to support and monitor follow-up action."" On Friday, authorities ordered the evacuation of four tower blocks in the Chalcots Estate in north London out of safety concerns - a move backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.

A search took place and the youngster, thought to be around 14 or 15, was held in a nearby shop in Nuthurst Road. He is being detained on suspicion of attempted rape and remains in custody for questioning, Greater Manchester Police said. The victim is receiving support from specially trained officers. The force called for calm and appealed for any witnesses to get in touch. Inspector Dave Whelan said: ""I know this incident has understandably caused a lot of unrest in the local community, particularly among those who were in the nearby area at the time but I want to assure everybody that we have launched a full investigation.

At the River Chess in Buckinghamshire there's no water flowing. The riverbed is dry, with cracked mud and weeds where the stream once ran. Chairman of the River Chess Association Paul Jennings said: ""This would be knee-depth crystal clear water that's come out of the chalk aquifer, with lovely fronds of weed. You have ducks and swans and all sorts of livestock in here plus fish. But we don't have that now."" It's been dried up since October, and it's not uncommon here. ""Over the last six years we've had four drying events, where there's been absolutely no water at all in this section,"" Mr Jennings said. The problem is, when rivers dry up, the wildlife leaves. The River Chess is home to kingfishers, rare water voles and several species of fish. The WWF warns 550 bodies of water in England and Wales are at risk of drying out. Its report says over-abstraction and poor management are to blame. Put simply, consumers and agriculture are taking out too much water from our rivers. The weather doesn't help either. April was one of the driest months on record, prompting fears parts of England and Wales could be heading for a drought. Tanya Steele, CEO of WWF, said: ""This can be avoided if we update the outdated way we manage the demand on our country's limited water supplies. We have already seen the impacts of a drought in some place with rivers drying up or running low. ""As we witness the effects of climate change on our weather, temporary actions simply won't do. The UK Government must urgently set out an ambitious long-term plan for the environment."" The WWF report says the Government has failed to take adequate action and is concerned long-term damage could be done to our waterways. If a severe drought was to happen, the WWF estimates it could cost the UK £1.3bn per day. A spokesman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Sky News ""We recognise the need to improve water management. That is why we are committed to reforming abstraction licensing into a simplified, modern system that is fairer and more resilient. ""The Environment Agency has already made significant changes to over 250 abstraction licences and we are examining a range of ways to further protect the environment, including legislative or regulatory changes."""

The Building Research Establishment (BRE) is ""running around the clock"" to test cladding on other buildings, he added. If needed, Mr Javid said, the BRE can test up to 100 samples a day. He said: ""The landlords for all the affected buildings are taking action to inform tenants and implement the interim safety measures needed. ""Areas affected include the city of Manchester, Camden, Plymouth, Hounslow, Portsmouth, Barnet and Brent. ""The fact that all samples so far have failed the tests underlines the value of the testing programme we have set up with the Building Research Establishment to get samples checked properly in the laboratories. ""It is therefore very important for local authorities and housing associations to continue to submit such samples as a matter of urgency."" Mr Javid stressed that buildings which are found to have unsafe cladding may not necessarily have to be evacuated. He said the decision to evacuate four towers on the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, was taken because a failed cladding test had been ""compounded by multiple other fire safety failures"". Muhammed Butt, the leader of north London's Brent Council, told Sky News the high-rise block in his area that failed has been checked by the fire service and evacuation was not deemed necessary. Cladding has been removed on two Portsmouth tower blocks after being found to be a fire risk, although local officials insisted the buildings were still safe for residents to stay in. The Local Government Association said: ""For those areas still waiting for results of tests on aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, our advice to them is to prepare contingency plans so they can take any measures needed quickly."" The Prime Minister said it is possible for some councils to take ""mitigating action"" on tower blocks, but in other cases it had been necessary to move people out. Theresa May added that the Government would ensure councils take ""immediate action"" over the failed tests, adding: ""Absolutely our first priority is people's safety"". In a statement, Mr Corbyn, who appeared at Glastonbury Festival, said: ""This is now a nationwide threat and the Prime Minister needs to get a grip and lead a national response, including convening the Cobra committee to coordinate Government and public action."" The Liberal Democrats demanded the Government declare a civil emergency, create a fund to compensate those evacuated and guarantee anyone told to leave their properties they won't have to pay council tax until they return. It comes as the manufacturer of the insulation used to clad Grenfell Tower said they would stop using the product on high-rise buildings. Celotex, which makes the RS5000 insulation boards in the tower's rainscreen cladding, insisted no building over 18m tall would be fitted with the material. At least 79 people are feared to have died after the west London tower block was engulfed by a huge fire 10 days ago. Six people are still being treated by three London hospitals following the disaster, with two in critical care, NHS England said. Along with local councils, NHS Trusts have also been told to urgently check their buildings to establish whether they are clad in materials used on Grenfell Tower."

The Cabinet minister branded the UK an ""irritating member"" of the EU and outlined his hope Brexit would turn the country into a ""friendly, comfortable ally"" of the bloc. Following the failure of the Prime Minister to secure a majority at the General Election, Mr Davis has been touted as a potential replacement for Mrs May. But he warned Tory MPs not to launch a bid to push out the Prime Minister in fear of destabilising the Brexit process. Asked whether a Tory leadership contest would be catastrophic for exit negotiations, Mr Davis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Yes. Yes. I happen to think we have got a very good Prime Minister. ""I know she is coming under a lot of pressure at the moment, but I have seen her in action."" Mr Davis added he wanted ""a stable backdrop to this Brexit negotiation"", while he labelled Tory MPs keen on a leadership challenge ""self-indulgent"". Along with his role in Brexit talks, Mr Davis said he had an ""invisible job"" of preparing the UK for the possibility of no agreement with the EU. Asked if there would be a deal, Mr Davis said: ""I'm pretty sure, I am not 100% sure, you can never be, it's a negotiation. ""I'm sure there will be a deal, whether it's the deal I want, which is a free trade agreement, the customs agreement, and so on, I'm pretty sure, but I'm not certain."" He also suggested there would be ""one to two years"" of transitional arrangements between the UK and EU. Veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke echoed Mr Davis' call for Tory MPs to forget about ousting Mrs May from Downing Street. The former chancellor told Sky News' Sophy Ridge he has seen ""nothing like"" the Tories' current situation during his 47 years in Parliament. He said: ""If the sillier people in the Conservative Party now decide that the best thing to do is start arguing about the leadership we will just make a very difficult, very serious situation rather absurd. ""What we need is to demonstrate we can form a competent Government."" Mr Clarke insisted ""the vast majority"" of Tory MPs and party members ""do not want us to plunge into a leadership crisis"". The europhile politician - the only Tory MP to vote against the Brexit-triggering Article 50 Bill - added he will be ""very opposed"" to any barriers to trade with the EU as the Government prepares to introduce Brexit legislation to Parliament. He suggested the General Election result will force Mrs May to compromise on her Brexit plans in order to ""reunite"" the Tory party, admitting: ""We are very divided on Europe."" 'Jobs and the economy' come first over immigration for the @UKLabour cabinet, says Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti #Ridge #Brexit pic.twitter.com/eZqyk8XUCw Labour's shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti also told Sophy Ridge her party is ""absolutely clear"" the economy has to be prioritised during Brexit by maintaining tariff-free access to the EU's Single Market. Asked how this fits with Labour's promise EU free movement rules will end, the peer said: ""We'll have control of free movement, you can't necessarily have complete control. ""What we want is to be able to have fair migration that avoids people's jobs being undercut."" Liberal Democrat leadership challenger Sir Vince Cable suggested to Sky News he supported the Archbishop of Canterbury's call for cross-party talks on Brexit in the wake of the indecisive General Election result. He said: ""There has to be a lot of cross-party discussion and this is beginning to happen in Parliament. ""The mood amongst MPs - I meet quite a few Labour and Tory MPs - is we're in a mess, the country's in a mess, we can't just proceed on the current basis. ""There is no mandate now for the very hard, extreme form of Brexit that Theresa May was committed to."""
2017-06-25,Theresa May has just survived what must undoubtedly the worst 10 days of her political career and the next 10 offer little respite.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170625220100/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-fights-for-survival-as-brexit-talks-start-10919984,"The Prime Minister is fighting on a number of fronts as she tries to command the country and her party in the wake of that crushing election defeat that has left her leadership in freefall and her credibility in tatters.It will be a crunch week for her as she struggles to get her premiership back on track amid rumours that she could face an imminent leadership challenge. And she will have to deal with the fallout of the van attack near the Finsbury Park mosque, which she said is being treated ""as a potential terrorist attack"". In her inbox this week - a major speech on Wednesday at the start of the Queen's Speech, where she will set out her legislative programme for the next two years.MPs won't actually vote on it until 28 June, but her benches will be watching her closely - every performance a test of her mettle after her faltering response to the Grenfell Tower disaster last week.There is also the matter of the DUP confidence-and-supply deal that still needs to be nailed down. No 10 are confident that the Unionists will vote with Mrs May, giving her an expected majority of around 13 - but she has yet to reach agreement.That deal is complicated by the wider politics of Northern Ireland, amid concerns that the deal with the DUP could hamper efforts to re-establish the stalled power-sharing executive at Stormont: to that end, the Prime Minister will on Monday meet the new Irish PM Leo Varadkar in Downing Street.""We will discuss Northern Ireland and the need to re-establish devolved Government, and Brexit, focusing on how we can avoid any adverse impact on the rights and freedoms of our citizens, on trade and the economy,"" Mr Varadkar said ahead of his bilateral meeting. Then, of course, is the start of Brexit talks, the Tories' fragile peace holding over the weekend after her Chancellor confirmed that there would be no rowing back on the promise to leave the single market and customs union. But those tensions will no doubt rise once more when the tussles over Britain's EU exit bill and the future deal begin in earnest. :: Labour claims Brexit 'disarray' on eve of talks in BrusselsHer MPs are in no doubt of her shortcomings - revealed in full technicolour during the election campaign, and then again last week when she initially failed to meet survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. ""Everyone knows she's not Mrs Emotional in public,"" said one minister, adding that they thought she had the support of most of her party still.But the stories about whether it's time for Mrs May to go - and who might replace her - won't dissipate. There are suggestions that once leader contender David Davis might be put up as a caretaker Prime Minister, rather as Michael Howard was back in 2004. There's talk of a ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge if she waters down Brexit - though there is no sign so far that she intends to do that.Another senior party figure said allies of Boris Johnson were taking soundings from colleagues, which was playing quite badly with some MPs who are adamant that further Tory infighting would play badly with the public. ""She's the only show in town,"" said the MP. ""The public don't want to see us knifing each other.""Mr Johnson's team insist any suggestion he's on manoeuvres is ""completely false"". ""Boris is supporting the Prime Minister and anyone doing this sort of thing is not acting with his knowledge or support,"" they say.While some in the party believe the Prime Minister is now a busted flush, opinion seems to be coalescing around the view that now is not the right time to change leader. As Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, put it on Sunday: ""I think what the country needs now is a period of calm while we get on with the job in hand. ""We've got one very serious issues to address, including the Brexit negotiations just starting. Theresa is leading the Government and I think the Government needs to get on with its job. ""And do you know what? I think actually that's what most people in this country will think - that the Government just needs to get on with the day job of Government.""Getting on with the job has become her new mantra as grand designs give way to hand-to-mouth survival. How long she stays in No 10 depends on her party, but for most MPs her continued leadership remains the least worst option - for now."

He said: ""People can always go back through the archives of any political party and find individuals saying things or policies from 20, 30 years ago. ""But they need to read our manifesto and look at the recent years in Northern Ireland where the DUP has been the main partner in government with republicans to move this province forward."" In his most famous speech, the Rev Ian Paisley, who founded the DUP, thundered that there would ""never, never, never"" be a role for Dublin in Northern Ireland. The firebrand preacher fiercely opposed Sinn Fein but historically compromised to share power with Martin McGuinness, signalling a new, more pragmatic era for unionism. His son, Ian Paisley junior MP, said: ""He was a man with a very strong faith and he would have said this is a time where you seek God's help and where you seek to have that wisdom to take the country forward. ""But he was also a deal-maker and a very good businessman and he would have taken the approach to make sure you get the very, very best deal for our people, the very, very best deal for our nation."" Nearly 300,000 people voted DUP in the General Election, some of them because of its social conservatism, others in response to a surge in the Sinn Fein vote at Stormont. Six months after the devolved administration collapsed over a public finance scandal, the DUP is holding the balance of power in Westminster and under the national spotlight. Mick Fealty, who runs the political blogging site Slugger O'Toole, said: ""I think their social conservatism is not anything that mainstream politics in England has experienced at any time really since the 1950s. ""I think they're reeling from the shock of thinking that this medieval-looking party is going to have a major influence in British politics."" But the party could find itself with less influence at home if any deal it strikes with the Tories negatively impacts on attempts to restore devolved government at Stormont."

The buildings are among 34 to have been deemed unsafe across the UK after emergency tests were carried out following the west London fire, which killed at least 79. All samples of cladding sent in from tower blocks around the country have so far failed combustibility tests, the Government has admitted. The tests were conducted as part of a round-the-clock programme set up to check 100 samples a day. The 34 buildings affected are from 17 local authority areas, including the city of Manchester, Camden, Plymouth, Hounslow, Portsmouth, Barnet and Brent. Along with multiple other fire safety failures, the alert caused Camden Council to order residents out of four tower blocks on Friday night - although around 20 households are still refusing to leave the Chalcots Estate. Mr Khan insisted the council had ""done the right thing"" despite the ""huge nuisance"" for residents of the 600 flats The towers were refurbished by Rydon - the same company involved in the multimillion pound refit of Grenfell Tower. The mayor said: ""Look, you've got to err on the side of caution. You can't play Russian roulette with people's safety. ""They've received the advice from the experts and they've acted on the advice."" He added: ""What can't be acceptable is, when a council knows a building's unsafe, for the council to still allow people to occupy those buildings."" Camden Council leader Georgia Gould said her staff would be reiterating to residents ""they must leave"" in order for the buildings to be made safe, in work expected to last between two to four weeks. She said: ""By remaining in the blocks these residents risk delaying the work that is required and that we are undertaking to make these homes safe. ""It is not safe to remain in these blocks and our residents' safety will continue to be the council's number one priority."" Amid rising tensions, residents remaining in the Taplow, Dorney, Bray and Burnham towers claimed they are being intimidated by security guards. Mandy Ryan, who shares her 22nd-floor flat in Dorney with her disabled son, said: ""I was bullied this morning trying to leave the building. He (the security guard) stood in front of the door and guys surrounded him and he said 'we need to know who you are'."" She added: ""I was so scared, he got so close to me - I could feel his breath on my face. ""We are not the villains here, we are the victims. We are not trying to impede any work whatsoever, we just want suitable accommodation."" Ms Ryan revealed she had been offered alternative accommodation in a neighbouring London borough but she was ""appalled"" at the state of disrepair. She has since been told she can stay in a nearby hotel that will accept her two dogs. Sayed Meah, 34, who has lived in Burnham since he was born, won't leave his eighth-floor flat until a care company that assists him in looking after his 78-year-old mother agrees to work at a new location. Brent and Portsmouth councils have deemed an evacuation of their properties unnecessary."

Georgina Gould, the leader of Camden Council, said on Sunday that residents still inside the 22-storey buildings on the Chalcots Estate ""must leave"". ""This morning council staff will conduct further door knocking to ask those who remain to leave, and issue another letter reiterating to residents who are still remaining in the Taplow, Bray, Dorney and Burnham blocks, that they must leave. ""By remaining in the blocks these residents risk delaying the work that is required and that we are undertaking to make these homes safe. ""It is not safe to remain in these blocks and our residents' safety will continue to be the council's number one priority."" Ms Gould also warned that the council has ""various legal routes"" which it could pursue to ""require people to leave their homes"" - however, she stressed: ""We really don't want to do this."" Those who have evacuated are now preparing to spend a second night out of their homes. Hotel rooms are being arranged for those residents who are not able to stay with family or friends during the repairs, which are expected to take up to four weeks. Four of the five towers at Chalcots Estate were evacuated following news that they had similar cladding to the material which exacerbated the Grenfell Tower fire in Kensington earlier this month, killing at least 79 people. Ms Gould said that, following checks, insulation was found to be safe but external cladding on the blocks ""was not up to the standard that we wanted and was not fire retardant"". Residents are being told to go to the rest centre at Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre where they can talk to council workers who will help them find temporary accommodation. Ms Gould said Camden Council has committed £100,000 of funds to pay for food, refreshments and other essential items which displaced residents need. This is on top of £500,000 already spent on hotel rooms for those affected. The Government says 34 high-rise blocks of flats in 17 local authority areas have failed fire cladding safety tests ordered following the Grenfell Tower disaster. Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said on Saturday night: ""A failure in testing of the cladding does not necessarily mean that a building will have to be evacuated. ""The decision by Camden Council to evacuate four of the five towers on the Chalcots Estate was because the failed testing of the external cladding was compounded by multiple other fire safety failures which the fire inspection team found within the buildings. ""Obviously, those residents in Camden who had to be asked to leave their homes at such short notice have had a distressing experience."" Mr Javid said he had ""deep admiration for the calm and stoicism"" with which many residents in Camden had handled their evacuation - with some of those affected angrily claiming they were only given a few hours' notice."

The five men who died last August were Ken Saththiyanathan, 18, his brother Kobi, 22, and their friends Nitharsan Ravi, 22, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27. The inquest heard Sri Lankan-born A-level student Ken Saththiyanathan was a ""healthy young man"". The brothers' father, Arumukam, said in a statement they had ""good swimming ability"" and his sons swam in Sri Lanka almost every weekend before they came to the UK in July 2008. He added that his son Kobi loved Camber Sands and had visited three times in 2016 before his death. Toxicology tests for both brothers were negative for drugs and alcohol. Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Brett Lockyer recorded a cause of death of immersion (drowning) for both following post-mortems. Ahead of the inquest, Ajirthan Ravi, the brother of victim Nitharsan Ravi, said he hoped the inquest would lead to an improvement of safety at Camber Sands. Mr Ravi told reporters: ""We are just hoping that it will be more secure and safer and more lifeguards, and that people are more protected."" This year, four lifeguards will patrol Camber Sands Central from 10am to 6pm, seven days a week, until 1 October. A further two lifeguards will patrol Camber Sands West during the same times from 8 July to 10 September."

However, twice a day the tide brings with it rubbish, much of it plastic, which is spreading across the wetlands and into the bird's habitat. It is feared this plastic is slowly being broken down and ingested by birds. The RSPB says it has organised official clean-ups, but the reserve manager Steve Webster admits it is frustrating. ""You're doing your best to sort of maintain this area for the wildlife and provide an area where people can come and watch the wildlife in a safe and clean environment. ""So you know piles of rubbish in the beach and stuff coming up constantly from the sea is sort of constantly degrading the site."" Sky Ocean Rescue: A plastic whale One man has had enough. Environmentalist Tim Bevan has single-handedly, and unpaid, collected and filled around 250 large bin-bags full of rubbish from the reserve. The mountain of waste, collected in just 40 days, sits stacked on the edge of the beach. ""It's very sad. Unless we deal with the causes here this problem is not going to go away,"" he said. ""It's going to get worse. That's why we have to change the way we live on this planet."" But the RSPB warns the waste visible at Medmerry is just the tip of the iceberg. Jeff Knot, head of Nature Policy at the organisation, said: ""So the plastic that we see on the beaches here is tiny compared to the amount that must still be washing around out in the oceans across the world. ""We need to make sure that they have safe places to feed. Otherwise, places like this, for all the management in the world, are just going to be safe places to starve."""

The number has risen from 34 tower blocks in 17 local authorities - and hundreds more have yet to be tested. It comes as Theresa May is due to chair a meeting of the Grenfell Tower recovery taskforce later which includes the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Downing Street sources say the Prime Minister is likely to hear how many of the country's high-rises are swathed in potentially flammable material. At least 79 people are believed to have died in the Grenfell Tower fire in west London. The building's cladding is widely blamed for spreading the blaze quickly up its 24 storeys. Housing Minister Alok Sharma refused to be drawn on whether the cladding used on the block was illegal. ""The rules in terms of this particular type of cladding are clear. Aluminium composite material which has a core of polyethylene should not be put on buildings which are 18 metres high. That is absolutely clear,"" he told Sky News. ""But obviously as a result of this terrible tragedy we are going to have to learn the lessons. If that means changes to regulations as a result of what comes out of the inquiry and the work that the police and the fire service are doing - then we will make those. ""This shouldn't have happened in the first place in our country, in the 21st century, and we need to make sure this never ever happens again."" The manufacturer of the insulation used to clad Grenfell Tower has said it will stop using the product on high-rise buildings. :: Where have the safety inspections failed? Officials are now conducting inspections of tower blocks across the country. Fourteen areas where buildings have failed the test have been identified, with 11 yet to be named. Five buildings failed the test in Sunderland; four in Manchester; three in Plymouth; three in Stockton-on-Tees; two in Portsmouth, and one each in Doncaster and Norwich. In London, five buildings have been deemed unsafe in Camden; three in Barnet; two in Wandsworth, and one each in Islington, Lambeth, Brent and Hounslow. The Department for Communities said in a statement: ""All landlords and fire and rescue services for these local authorities have been alerted to the results and we are in touch with all of them to support and monitor follow-up action."" :: Tower block residents defy council's evacuation order On Friday, authorities ordered the evacuation of four tower blocks in the Chalcots Estate in north London out of safety concerns - a move backed by Sadiq Khan. But some 200 residents from 120 homes are still refusing to leave, according to Camden Council leader Georgia Gould. Tensions are running high, with some residents saying they were intimidated by security guards. Mr Sharma told Sky News: ""I understand people living in tower blocks around the country will be extremely concerned and that is why we have been clear that we have put in place a regime of getting cladding that may not be compliant tested as quickly as possible. ""As soon as we identify a piece of cladding on a building that is non-compliant, the local authority is informed immediately, the fire authority is informed, and the fire service then goes in and sees whether there can be mitigation measures put in place so that people don't have to leave the building whilst the cladding is taken down. ""In the case of Camden, what happened was apart from the cladding there were other fire safety checks which failed and that is why people had to be evacuated."""
2017-06-26,"Jeremy Corbyn has predicted he will be Prime Minister within six months and vowed to wanted to scrap Trident ""as soon as I can"", it was claimed last night.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170626194928/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-says-he-will-be-prime-minister-in-six-months-report-10927252,"The Labour leader's unguarded comments, apparently made backstage, were revealed by Glastonbury festival founder Michael Eavis who took questions from an audience today. Mr Corbyn received a rapturous reception from fans as he spoke from the Pyramid Stage on Saturday, capping an extraordinary turnaround in his fortunes over the past three weeks. But he may have revealed more than he intended to in the private chat with Mr Eavis who said: ""Wasn't he fantastic?"" ""I said to him, 'When are you going to be prime minister?' He said, 'In six months.'"" Mr Eavis said he had asked Corbyn: ""When are you going to get rid of Trident?"" And added: ""He said, 'As soon as I can,'"" according to the Somerset Live website. The 81-year-old host of the festival made his comments at a Q&A at the Speakers Forum in the Green Futures area of Glastonbury. The Labour leader included the policy to back renewal of Trident in his election manifesto in recognition of the fact that it is the party's policy to keep the nuclear deterrent. But he is a long-standing supporter of unilateral nuclear disarmament, and his comments will concern many in the party who suspect he could try to force a change in party policy. Any such move would be difficult to get past the party's conference, in view of opposition from Mr Corbyn's trade union backers. Renewal of the four submarines was backed by a free vote in Parliament last year, by a large majority of MPs. Mr Corbyn suggested Labour were the winners of the 8 June vote, saying: ""It is pretty clear who has won this election."" He said that the Conservatives had lost and that Labour - which did not secure enough seats to form a working majority with other parties - was ""ready to serve."" He has since declared to Unison members this weekend that he would look to ""challenge this Government at every step and try to force an early General Election"" and claimed that it was ""ludicrous"" to suggest Theresa May could stay in power. A member of the audience asked for Mr Eavis's thoughts about the increasing numbers of young voters who turned out in the 2017 General Election, helping Labour make gains. Mr Eavis said: ""Why didn't they vote in the referendum? [Corbyn supporters group] Momentum should have done more to persuade them to vote."" Mr Corbyn presented him with a signed copy of the Labour manifesto during his appearance. Mr Eavis told Glastonbury's own newspaper he was ""thrilled"" with Labour's result at the General Election. ""Millions of young people, Glastonbury people, voted for him,"" Mr Eavis said. ""I think he has a fundamental sense of justice, of real political change, of being anti-war and anti-nuclear. That's what we've spent our lives campaigning for too."" A Labour source said the remarks may have been ""paraphrased"" by Mr Eavis, adding: ""Jeremy Corbyn has made clear he is keen to fight the next election which it is speculated could be in the next six months. ""Renewal of Trident was in the Labour party's manifesto which Jeremy was proud to stand on. He has made clear he is committed to nuclear non-proliferation. No one person can change party policy, it is a done through a process."""
2017-06-26,Glastonbury's finale saw Ed Sheeran and his guitar climb the most iconic stage in the world - and it was always going to divide people.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170626194928/http://news.sky.com/story/was-ed-sheeran-worthy-of-the-pyramid-stage-10927528,"""Glastonbury, how are you doing?"" yelled a nervous Ed as he faced, for the first time, the more than 100,000 people at the Pyramid Stage on Sunday night. ""I have to admit, I'm very nervous, but I'm very excited, very excited,"" the 26-year-old singer confessed. Behind him, no one. The empty stage filled with screens showing the lonely troubadour in various angles, reminding everyone of how big of a pop star he is. In a festival lined up by ageless rock stars, timeless pop bands and Katy Perry, the sight of a timid young man closing its biggest stage felt odd - and reactions to his act have reflected the divide among its viewers. And I say viewers because there is little chance that Ed has disappointed any of his fans - those who went to Glastonbury to see him press his loop pedal will have held their phones aloft and gone home singing . Ed sheeran headlining Glastonbury with just his guitar and killing it with what he's come from is encouraging for the music industry. The irony of someone holding up a 'punks not dead' flag whilst watching Ed Sheeran headline glasto For them he was ""a legend"", ""killing it"" alone in the stage. It was ""encouraging for the music industry"". But for the (semi)-hard rockers waiting to see Foo Fighters return, or the nineties nostalgics climbing up the walls to buy a re-issue of OK Computer, waving goodbye to Glasto at the sound of Galway Girl just didn't cut it. ""This Ed Sheeran set is basically Eurovision,"" one Twitter user wrote. ""The irony of someone holding up a 'punks not dead' flag whilst watching Ed Sheeran headline glasto,"" wrote another. But while haters hate and lovers love, music critics seem to almost unanimously agree that Sheeran held his act, against all odds. The Guardian called him ""defiantly alone and thrilling raw""; NME said his set was ""an absolutely triumph""; and The Telegraph called it a ""wonderful end to a wonderful Glastonbury"". Only the Independent thought Ed belonged in the Olympus of ""least satisfying headliners in recent memory"". But does he? Looking back at Glastonbury dating back to the 1990s, you find odd choices like Shakespeare's Sister, Lenny Kravitz and Travis headlining the Pyramid. Just last year, Adele faced a similar reaction when she closed the Saturday slot at the festival. But maybe it just means The Pyramid Stage is the wrong place to be at Glastonbury, and festival goers are better off checking out the complicated gospel of Father John Misty or the psychedelic country of Whitney. Or Alt-J, Phoenix, Justice and Dizzee Rascal. Maybe Glastonbury works so well because it is an eclectic festival with enough room to cater to everyone's taste, from Ed Sheeran to the House Gospel Choir and even Jeremy Corbyn."

Demanding ministers ensure the maintenance of ""frictionless"" trade with the bloc and agree an ""essential"" transitional departure deal, Mr Platten described the nervousness of ferry companies about the result of Brexit negotiations. He told Sky News how his organisation, which represents 170 members from across the maritime industry, is also calling on the Government to initiate cross-party talks on Brexit in the wake of the General Election result. On Sunday, Brexit Secretary David Davis admitted he is ""not 100% sure"" he will achieve the departure deal he wants, including a new agreement to replace Britain's membership of the Customs Union. Mr Platten said: ""We just want friction-less trade, whether that's in or outside the Customs Union. ""We'll see as it develops, maybe they'll call it a 'special customs arrangement' or something like that to save face."" He described ferry companies as ""really nervous"" while ""hauliers are starting to wake up to the fact this is going to not be good"". If Britain is left with a ""hard border"" with the EU, lorries piling up on the M20 motorway in Kent on their way to Dover would be a ""continuous"" sight as the port does not have the space for a big customs installation, Mr Platten warned. With 8,000 lorries passing through Dover each day on average - and sometimes as many as 11,000 - only around 500 are from non-EU countries, each taking 20 minutes to pass customs checks, Mr Platten explained. If all vehicles had to undergo those checks in the absence of an EU customs agreement, the former Merchant Navy officer predicted: ""It's going to be pretty much a nightmare."" Mr Platten described a transitional exit deal as ""maybe the best we can hope for at the moment"" and suggested it is ""inevitable"" the Government will have to compromise following the General Election result. He said: ""You look at the Labour manifesto and you look at the Conservative manifesto, it's not a million miles apart is it? You can put a cigarette paper between it. ""It's such an important event for the country it needs to transcend party politics."" Outside the Customs Union, UK ferry companies could scrap duties on alcohol or cigarettes which might spell a return of the ""booze cruise""."

A large portion of the cash - £400m - is going to be spent on infrastructure, with ""significant"" investment also planned in health and education. In exchange, the Conservatives will now receive support from the DUP's 10 MPs on key votes in the Commons - including those relating to the Queen's Speech, the Budget, national security and Brexit. :: How Northern Ireland's extra £1bn will be spent DUP leader Arlene Foster has confirmed there will now be no changes to the triple lock on pensions anywhere in the UK following the deal - with the Tories also abandoning plans to means-test winter fuel payments. The agreement was signed inside Downing Street by Tory chief whip Gavin Williamson and the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson while the party leaders watched on. Once the deal was reached, the Prime Minister said: ""I welcome this agreement which will enable us to work together in the interest of the whole United Kingdom, give us the certainty we require as we embark on our departure from the European Union, and help us build a stronger and fairer society at home. ""The agreement we have come to is a very, very good one, and we look forward to working with you."" News that the deal has been confirmed immediately sparked calls for other parts of the UK to receive a similar boost in funding. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the agreement was not in the national interest, adding: ""The Government must immediately answer two questions. Where is the money for the Tory-DUP deal coming from? ""And, will all parts of the UK receive the much needed additional funding that Northern Ireland will get as part of the deal?"" Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones described the £1bn injection as a ""straight bung to keep a weak Prime Minister and a faltering Government in office"". Plaid Cymru went one further, and said Wales should receive a £1.7bn boost in funding given it has a larger population. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron labelled the Tory-DUP arrangement as a ""shoddy little deal"", adding: ""While our schools are crumbling and our NHS is in crisis, Theresa May chooses to throw cash at 10 MPs in a grubby attempt to keep her Cabinet squatting in Number 10.""

The girl, from Delaware, was in one of the ride's two-person cars with her younger brother. A video clip of the episode, captured on a mobile phone by a bystander, shows the youngster dangling from the ride while it is still in motion. ""Oh my God, she is in for it,"" one onlooker can be heard saying. ""You should be right underneath to catch her,"" advises a woman to the growing crowd. The ride is eventually stopped by the operator close to a tree amid screams and people shouting advice to the girl. ""Don't swing!"" onlookers yell to the her as she tries to reach a tree branch with her feet. ""Hold on, don't let go!"" others can be heard saying. Matthew Howard Sr was leaving the attraction on Saturday evening with his family when he heard the youngster screaming for help and looked up to see her dangling from the cable ride. Mr Howard, 47, and his 21-year-old daughter, Leeann Winchell, ran over and positioned themselves under the girl as the ride stopped and park security officials came running. ""I said: 'It's 'OK! It's OK to let go, I'll catch you, honey,'"" said Mr Howard. The girl lets go and is caught by the pair to cheers and applause.

Instead, Mrs May said family dependents joining EU citizens living in the UK after Britain's exit ""will be subject to the same rules as those joining British citizens"" who arrive after the cut-off point. The Government also again rejected calls from the EU that the rights of citizens be upheld by the European Court of Justice, stating in its offer document today that the ECJ ""will not have jurisdiction in the UK"", but would instead be guaranteed by UK law. Following the PM's statement, the European Commission's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted: ""EU goal on #citizensrights: same level of protection as in EU law. More ambition, clarity and guarantees needed than in today's UK position."" Meanwhile, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt wrote: ""A number of limitations remain worrisome and will have to be carefully assessed."" The differences in position - both on rights and who enforces them - underline how tough these negotiations could be in the coming weeks, as the two sides try to thrash out a deal that will affect one million Britons living in the EU and an estimated 3.2 million EU citizens living in the UK. The scale of the administrative task facing the Government was also laid bare on Monday, as the Home Office said it had given itself a two-year window to process applications from EU citizens for ""settled status"" to protect their rights. That could amount to over 4,000 applications a day. ""It's most definitely a challenge for the Home Office,"" said an official. The Government said it would scale up the operations to process applications but admitted that it had not done a study on whether there will be a surge in migration before the cut-off point. The 15-page document will grant EU citizens who have lived in the UK for five years ""settled status"" after Britain leaves, meaning they will be treated as if they are UK citizens for healthcare, education, benefits and pensions. There will be a ""cut-off date"" which will be no earlier than the day Britain triggered Article 50 - 29 March 2017 - and no later than Britain's withdrawal from the EU. However, the Government said EU citizens had a two year window after Brexit to apply for ""settled status"" in order to avoid a cliff-edge. The paper also says that EU citizens who arrive before the cut-off date, but with fewer than five years as a resident, will be given time to stay in order to obtain settled status. Those who arrive after the cut-off point can stay in the UK for a temporary period but ""should have no expectation of guaranteed settled status"". Key points from the paper include:  :: EU citizens applying for ""settled status"" will have to bring over dependants before the UK's exit from the EU. After Brexit, dependents will be subject to the standard UK immigration rules. :: EU citizens with ""settled status"" will continue to have access to UK benefits on the same basis as a comparable UK national. ::  EU citizens who do not have five years' residence at the time of the UK's exit but are on ""pathway"" to settled status will be able to access the same benefits as now - equal access for those in work and limited benefit access for unemployed. :: The Government will create new rights in UK law for qualifying EU citizens resident here or before exit. This will be enforced by UK courts. The European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction in the UK. :: EU citizens will no longer be able to vote in local elections. :: EU nationals will be allowed to keep sending their UK benefits to other countries in the EU - such as child benefit - if they were already doing so before the ""cut-off date"". :: The UK will continue to pay out state pension within the EU to qualifying EU nationals. :: The UK will protect healthcare arrangements for EU citizens who arrive in the UK before the ""cut-off date"" for UK nationals living in the EU. :: The UK will protect a UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) so British citizens can continue to benefit from free temporary healthcare while in the EU. :: EU citizens who arrived before the ""cut-off date"" will continue to be eligible for student loans, and ""home fee"" status in line with persons with settled status in the UK."

At celebrations to mark Eid in the nearby Leisure Centre, she told a gathering of dozens of Chalcots residents that she was sorry for the disruption and stress the evacuation had caused. Ms Gould said that the council was left with no choice after the London Fire brigade declared the blocks unsafe. :: Labour's John McDonnell: Grenfell Tower victims 'were murdered' The council leader said she was determined to try to convince remaining residents to leave, but if some still refused, the council would have to take action to remove them. Mahdi Addihakim returned with his mother to pick up their belongings from their apartment in the Taplow block, before heading back to the hotel room which is now home to five of them. He told me his family were just fed up, that they desperately wanted to go home, but had no idea when that might be. Ms Gould told us it was hoped the work to remedy the tower block's safety issues would be completed within a month. :: Where have the safety inspections failed? Carl McDowell lives on the 4th floor of Taplow. He's now returned to his flat, unable to stand another night sleeping on an airbed in the leisure centre. He told us he would be willing to move into temporary accommodation, but the council had not yet responded to his calls. ""Yes, I'm still waiting and waiting to see if they're going to find us anywhere decent to go before they kick us out of here,"" he said. In a sequence filmed inside his flat on his mobile phone, Mr McDowell said: ""The house is just where it was when we evacuated. I've been back in the house and packed a suitcase, ready and waiting to leave. ""Still haven't heard anything so who knows what they're doing. ""I've called the council number multiple times and they still haven't got back to me. Just waiting to get on out of the place so they can get on doing the work."" Some 60 tower block residents spent a second night at the Swiss Cottage leisure centre. The council said it hoped most would be found temporary accommodation before having to spend a third night there. At the foot of Bray Tower, I met Raj Want Ludher, who has lived in a 7th floor flat here for 30 years. She told me she was determined she would not be leaving, that she had no family to go and live with and that she felt perfectly safe in the tower block. For Camden council officials, it will be a tricky few days ahead, trying to gently coax unwilling residents like Raj Want to leave their homes and desperately hoping they do not have to resort to tougher measures."
2017-06-26,One lesson from political agreements involving Northern Ireland is the devil is in the detail - or conspicuously not.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170626194928/http://news.sky.com/story/tory-dup-deal-what-the-agreement-says-and-what-it-actually-means-10928149,"So what does the deal the Conservative Party has struck with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) say and - more importantly - what does it actually mean in practice? Firstly, there is the question of the cash - £1.5bn of it in total: £1bn in new money and £500m previously agreed but never released due to political stalemate. How has the Government added that sum to Northern Ireland's Block Grant without using the Barnett Formula - the mechanism for the allocation of funds across the UK's other devolved regions, Scotland and Wales? Well, according to sources close to the negotiations, it is because the Barnett Formula is ""advisory"" - a convention, rather than something enshrined in legislation. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggested that ""any sense of fairness"" had been ""sacrificed on the altar"" of a ""grubby DUP deal to let the PM cling to power"". :: How Northern Ireland's extra £1bn will be spent The second question is one of influence. How much sway will the DUP hold as a result of this confidence and supply arrangement with the Tories? The short answer is: a lot. The establishment of a ""co-ordination committee"" gives the Northern Ireland party a much greater say on legislation and, most notably, on Brexit. Thirdly, some have suggested the financial package is provisional upon the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland at the earliest opportunity. That is simply not the case. Both parties ""recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland's history"" and ""agree the need for additional support"", as outlined. It is those ""unique circumstances"" that create the potential for direct rule so Sky News understands the agreement will stand regardless of the outcome at Stormont. But make no mistake about it. This deal piles huge pressure on Northern Ireland's political parties to reach their own power-sharing agreement before Thursday's deadline. The Government says it hopes this will help them do that. What it means is it hopes the money the DUP is bringing home will entice Sinn Fein back into Stormont."

2017-06-26,The largest warship ever built in the UK is due to set sail for the first time today. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170626194928/http://news.sky.com/story/royal-navys-largest-ever-warship-hms-queen-elizabeth-sets-sail-10927338,"HMS Queen Elizabeth, the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier, will leave her dock in Scotland around lunchtime to start two years of sea trials. She is named after Elizabeth the first and is the second ship to carry the name - the first was a World War One battleship. More than 700 crew are onboard, from seamen to aircraft engineers, dentists to force protection. The oldest crew member is 58 and the youngest 17 although the average age is in the early twenties. In recent weeks they have been practising drills and familiarising themselves with their new ship. Their first task will be to successfully sail her out of the basin she was built in. It will need precise calculations and nerves of steel. At high tide, she will be guided through a narrow exit in the harbour. This has been widened but still only allows 14 inches either side to spare. Recent dry weather in the Highlands and Cairngorms has meant less rainfall in the Forth - when she squeezes through the exit, the man at the steering wheel on the bridge - Chief Petty Officer Sticky Vercoe - will only have 50cm beneath the keel and the river bed. The flight deck will overhand buildings either side. If the wind is too strong she risks bouncing off the harbour walls which could damage her before she's even reached open water. Once clear she will be pulled into the middle of the Forth where she will drop anchor for a few hours. At low tide, she will make her approach towards the three Forth bridges close to midnight, sailing at 3-4 knots; any faster and suction will pull her downwards into the river - an effect known as 'squat'. The first two road bridges can flex by up to three metres in high winds but the third, Brunel's iconic Forth Bridge, poses its own challenge - height. A radar mast will be hydraulically lowered to make room for the ship to pass underneath. Even so, were a person to stand on the highest point of her, and reach up, they would be able to touch the Forth Bridge as they sailed through. ""It is like driving your car into a car park you go 'oh my god' and dip in your seat. It is exactly the same feeling as that,"" said Captain Jerry Kyd, who has previously commanded the UK's last two aircraft carriers HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious. The whole process could take more than 10 hours. The following six weeks will be spent in the North Sea and Moray Firth ""proving systems"" - she will finally sail into her home port of Portsmouth sometime in the autumn. Flight trials will begin off the eastern seaboard of the United States in October 2018. HMS Queen Elizabeth has taken more than eight years to build and is the first of two new carriers for the Navy; a second, the Prince of Wales, will follow in two years' time. Together they will cost over £6bn, a price tag which the ship's first commanding officer defends as value for money. ""You look at all the premier nations around the world and why is it that every nation in the top tier are investing billions of dollars in aircraft carriers? Is it just us or has everyone got it wrong here?"" Cptn Kyd points out. ""The reason being is they provide the government, very simply, with an incredibly flexible tool that is not just about war fighting. ""This is about deterrence, coercion, political signalling and providing a huge sea base - don't forget it is not a ship - it is a sea base for disaster relief, humanitarian assistance, defence engagement and selling British industry abroad."""

She added: ""I'm just focusing on doing my job as best I can and staying humble. ""Any of my peers would be absolutely delighted to be Captain of the Queen's Guard and I'm equally honoured."" A female officer has not previously taken the role - known as Mounting the Queen's Guard - because until July last year women were banned from ground close combat roles. But combat roles are now being opened to women over a three-year period.

2017-06-26,Seventy-five high-rise blocks across 26 local authorities have failed fire safety tests since the Grenfell Tower disaster.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170626194928/http://news.sky.com/story/75-high-rise-buildings-fail-fire-safety-tests-after-grenfell-disaster-10928148,"Checks are being carried out on hundreds of tower blocks after it was established that the cladding on the 26-storey building helped the fire, which is believed to have killed at least 79 people, to spread. Communities minister Sajid Javid told the Commons that the so-called combustibility test had been failed by every building examined so far. ""The fact that all samples so far have failed underlines the value of the testing programme and the vital importance of submitting samples urgently,"" he said. ""I am concerned about the speed at which samples are being submitted. ""I would urge all landlords to submit their samples immediately."" :: £1.5m paid out to Grenfell Tower fire victims Mr Javid also said that more than 1,000 fire doors were missing from four Camden tower blocks evacuated after fire safety checks. ""When the commissioners went into those tower blocks in Camden, in their own words, they found multiple fire safety inspection failures, failures which frankly should not have happened in tower blocks of any type, certainly those tower blocks in Camden,"" he told MPs. ""For example there were problems with gas pipe insulation, there were stairways that were not accessible, there were breaches of internal walls and most astonishingly there were hundreds, literally hundreds, of fire doors missing."" Schools and hospitals will also be tested to make sure their cladding is not combustible, Downing Street said earlier. The latest update on the number of buildings on which the flammable cladding was used came as the US supplier of the covering said it was stopping sales for high-rise buildings. ""Arconic is discontinuing global sales of Reynobond PE for use in high-rise applications,"" a company spokesman said. The firm put the decision down to ""issues that have arisen in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy"" and differences in building regulations around the world. Labour has called for a ""triple fire safety lock"" to guarantee the standards of buildings. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said such a guarantee would include materials being fit for purpose and meeting safety specifications, plus regular fire risk assessments. Meanwhile, Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox opened and adjourned the inquests into the deaths of four people in Grenfell Tower. The inquest heard five-year-old Isaac Paulos choked to death on fumes from the fire and had to be identified by his dental records He lived on the 18th floor, but his body was found on the 13th. He had disappeared as his family attempted to escape the flames. The other three victims whose inquests were opened included artist Khadija Saye, 24; her mother, Mary Ajaoi Augustus Mendy; and Mohamednur Tuccu, 44. All three were also recorded as inhaling fumes."

The areas named so far include Barnet, Brent, Camden, Doncaster, Hounslow, Islington, Lambeth, Manchester, Norwich, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Stockton on Tees, Sunderland and Wandsworth. The Government has said it is not identifying the other areas until residents have been notified, so as not to cause undue concern. Some of the buildings where problem cladding has been identified include: Chalcots estate, Swiss Cottage, central London On Friday, authorities ordered the evacuation of four tower blocks following safety concerns over cladding, fire doors, gas pipes and external insulation. However, around 200 residents from 120 homes have refused to leave, according to Camden Council leader Georgia Gould. Ms Gould told Sky News the authority believed fireproof panels were installed during a 2006 refurbishment, but that proved ""not to be the case"". The company in charge of fitting the cladding to the affected Camden towers oversaw the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, according to its website. Rivers Apartments, Tottenham, north London Newlon Housing Trust said the 22-storey tower block was fitted with the same cladding reportedly used on Grenfell Tower. However, following an ""extensive safety audit"", London Fire Brigade said it would be considered a ""low fire risk"" after modifications and technical clarifications.Village 135 development, Wythenshawe, Manchester Staff from the Wythenshawe Community Housing Group are removing 78 ""failed"" panels from a small area of the development. Greater Manchester Fire Service said its fire risk audit of the site concluded the building ""is safe for all residents"". It added: ""We are happy with WCHG's active and passive fire systems"". Mount Wise Tower Estate, Plymouth The outer layer of cladding on three 16-storey blocks was found to be aluminium coated with a polyethylene core, which has the lowest fire rating score. Plymouth Community Homes says it is removing the panels and security teams are monitoring the blocks 24/7. It is also installing heat detectors in every flat and sprinkler systems in each tower. Pendleton, Salford Cladding on nine high-rise blocks has been identified as being made from aluminium composite material (ACM), which was used on Grenfell Tower. Samples are being sent to the Department for Communities and Local Government to be tested independently by fire experts. Pendleton Together, the management company that runs the blocks, said questions about the cladding were a ""real concern"" for residents. The firm said every householder in a high-rise block would have a home visit to carry out basic fire safety checks on doors and smoke alarms Patrols of the buildings are also being carried out ""as a precautionary safety measure"". Braithwaite House, Islington, central London ACM was also detected in cladding fitted to this high-rise and Islington Council says the panels are to be removed. Test results from the other blocks, Harvist Estate and Brunswick Estate, are yet to be returned, the council said. Ferrier Point, Newham, east London The tower was reportedly found to have cladding panels with ACM. Refurbishment of the building, including cladding, was overseen by Rydon, the company involved in the refit of Grenfell Tower. However, the insulation behind the cladding was said to be highly fire-resistant Rockwool Duoslab. Two other buildings in the borough are also said to have ACM cladding, Newham Council said. ""We are following the process as set out by DCLG for sample testing of buildings with ACM cladding,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Once the results are known, we will take whatever action is necessary to ensure our residents are safe. Clements Court, Hounslow, west London Outer cladding on the high-rise failed a fire safety test and will be removed ""as soon as possible"", Hounslow Council said. The authority says a fire watch patrol will be set up and homes will undergo safety tests. Barnet, north London Three towers were found to have similar rain screen panels on their cladding as Grenfell Tower, but a non-combustible insulation material. Granville Point, Harpenmead Point and Templemead Point blocks were all reclad in 2012, Barnet Council said. Samples have been sent to the Government. Denning Point, Tower Hamlets, east London Cladding ""did not fully comply with the requirements"" of safety tests, Tower Hamlets Council said. The building is covered by the fire retardant version of ACM panels, according to a joint statement from the council and owners EastendHomes. Communal areas are being patrolled 24/7. Castlemaine Tower, Battersea, south west London Officials found external cladding did not meet fire safety standards and it is being removed ""as soon as possible"", Wandsworth Council says. However, London Fire Brigade concluded the building was safe for residents following an ""exhaustive"" inspection. The council said more than 100 high-rise housing blocks are being fitted with sprinkler systems. It added that samples taken from Sudbury House, Wandsworth High Street, are also being tested. Horatia House and Leamington House, Portsmouth Cladding fitted to the two high-rises is being removed after tests revealed a fire risk. Portsmouth City Council deputy leader Luke Stubbs said round-the-clock fire patrols have been put in place and firefighters have carried out a full assessment. He said: ""The buildings are safe to stay in with all of the existing safety measures still in place."" Silverwood House, Doncaster Window capping is being removed after it was found to have fire retardant, not fire resistant, properties. Doncaster Council chief executive Jo Miller said the decision was made ""to reflect that the health and safety of residents is our main priority"". Halifax Independent contractors are checking three blocks in Lower Mixenden, a village outside Halifax. Samples of cladding from Jumples Court, Mixenden Court and Wheatley Court are being sent to the Government. However, Together Housing said initial visual inspection suggests it is not the same type as that used on Grenfell Tower. Harold Lambert Court, Sheffield The high-rise is being checked by management firm, Together Housing, with cladding samples sent off for analysis."

It is alleged officers used force and sprayed the 25-year-old with CS gas, before he was taken to hospital in a critical condition and died six days later. During a protest over Mr Da Costa's death, demonstrators shouted ""we want justice"" and ""justice for Edson"" as they clashed with riot police in Forest Gate and Stratford, east London. Four police officers were taken to hospital, including a male police sergeant who suffered facial injuries and a female constable who sustained head injuries as demonstrators threw ""a number of objects"" toward officers in Stratford. Four people were arrested for offences including disorder, arson and criminal damage in connection with the demonstration. As tempers flared, riot officers wearing helmets stood shoulder to shoulder and two-person deep outside Forest Gate police station. Firefighters, protected by police, put out a fire set in a bin in Richmond Road. Other bins were set alight near a McDonald's in Romford Road. Witness Cindy Wijaya told Sky News she saw residents extinguishing fires themselves. She said: ""It was frightening. (Protesters) were creating chaos for themselves and the police, but they were not hurting any neighbours around the area."" Earlier, superintendent Ian Larnder stood in the middle of a group of demonstrators, trying to answer their questions and calm tensions. He said: ""I am here because l care deeply about what is going on. Police officers are all accountable to the law. They are being investigated."" Family campaigners insisted the event had been set up as a peaceful march and they did not condone the violence. Campaigners claim Mr Da Costa's neck was broken and he suffered head injuries after he was stopped on 15 June. However, the IPCC said a preliminary post-mortem found Mr Da Costa did not suffer a broken neck, or any other spinal injury. He also did not suffer a broken collarbone or bleeding to the brain, it added. In a statement, the IPCC said it made the findings public ""out of concern at the rapid spread of false and potentially inflammatory information"". Warning that ""false information could have very dangerous consequences"", it said its investigation into the incident ""will seek to explain the circumstances around Mr Da Costa's death""."

Lifeguards raised red flags to clear holidaymakers out of the water, before the Guardia Civil conducted a search of the area. The shark managed to swim back out to sea, but was later spotted in shallow water on a beach along the coast in Can Pastilla. Crowds watched as it was pulled from the water by lifeguards, before being put down by wildlife experts from nearby Palma Aquarium. It was said to have approached the packed beaches after sustaining a serious head injury caused by a harpoon.

The reports were sent to the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) in April 2016 by BRE Global, formerly the Government's Building Research Establishment, which went on to reassure ministers that building controls, which BRE has influenced since 1948, were ""adequate"". The documents seen by Sky News show that in last year's study of tower block fire safety it concluded: ""With the exception of one or two unfortunate cases, there is currently no evidence from BRE Global's fire investigations for DCLG to suggest that current building regulation recommendations, to limit vertical fire spread up the exterior of high rise buildings, are failing in their purpose."" The documents go on to warn of ""an increase in the volume of potential combustible materials being applied. A number of significant fires… have demonstrated the potential risks"". BRE is now being paid to test cladding being removed from high rise buildings across the country in response to the Grenfell Tower disaster, in which 79 people are thought to have died after fire spread rapidly up cladding containing combustible insulation and plastic panels. BRE has been paid by DCLG since at least 2007 to ""investigate issues that may have implications for building regulations"". Last week, DCLG said councils and housing associations must ""immediately"" take action if they have tower blocks with flammable polyethelyne (PE) panelling like that used on Grenfell Tower, which is ""unlikely to be compliant with the requirements of the current Building Regulations"". Seventy-five tower blocks have since been identified with unsafe cladding and panelling is being removed from buildings across the country. One, Park Heights in Stockwell, was built last year and won a prestigious design award from The Royal Institute of British Architects. Sam Webb, a fire safety expert and retired architect who sits on the all-party Parliamentary Fire Safety & Rescue Group, told Sky News the use of flammable materials on tower blocks is ""the biggest failure in the construction industry in British history"". Combustible cladding and insulation were specifically named in planning applications for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment which were approved by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The design was later changed and an even more dangerous cladding was fitted. Both the insulation - Celotex RS5000 - and the panels - Reynobond PE - have now been removed from worldwide sale by their respective manufacturers."

Scots voted against independence by 55% to 45% in a referendum in 2014, but Ms Sturgeon has called for a new vote in the wake of Brexit, as Scots are overwhelmingly opposed to leaving the European Union. However, her plans suffered a setback with a weak performance in the General Election, when the SNP lost 21 seats. Speaking to MSPs at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: ""The Conservative Government at Westminster are taking this country down a path that is potentially the most damaging thing that has happened to us for a generation or more. ""We do not know the destination of that journey but what we do know is that if the Tories get their way, the outcome of this could be devastating for Scottish jobs, for trade, for living standards, for the opportunities for generations to come. ""I do not think it is right for Scotland to be left at the mercy of wherever the Tories want to take us regardless of how damaging that is to our present and to our future."" Earlier, Theresa May had urged Ms Sturgeon to take a demand for a second independence referendum off the table. ""What I think Nicola Sturgeon should be saying today is that she's going to completely take off the table the question of Indy Ref 2, a second independence referendum in Scotland,"" the PM said. Her comment was echoed by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson during a debate at Holyrood. ""Most people don't want this brought back anytime soon,"" said Ms Davidson. ""Why doesn't she give the country some certainty and just take it off the table for the rest of this parliament?"" Sky News' Scotland Correspondent James Matthews says Ms Sturgeon's new stance reflects the lack of support on the issue. ""She doesn't have the public support - that's what the numbers at the General Election told her. ""Essentially, in the immediate term it's a project going nowhere. She needs to shore up support.""

In a statement released by the Metropolitan Police, his family said: ""Isaac our beloved son was taken from us when he was only five years old. ""We will all miss our kind, energetic, generous little boy. :: Government rejects suggestions of a cover-up ""He was such a good boy who was loved by his friends and family. ""We will miss him forever, but we know God is looking after him now and that he is safe in heaven."" :: Government fire investigators reported cladding 'risks' in 2016 The coroner heard that the little boy, believed to be one of the youngest victims of the blaze in which at least 79 people died, vanished in the dense smoke as his family tried to escape and choked on the fumes from the fire. The number of victims identified is 19, although 11 names have not been released at the request of their families. Also named and identified so far are Mohammad Alhajali,23, Ya-Haddy Sisi Saye, also known as Khadija Saye,24, Anthony Disson,65, Abufars Ibrahim,39, Khadija Khalloufi,52, Mary Mendy,52, Abdeslam Sebbar,77. Meanwhile, a residents' group has written to Theresa May and Home Secretary Amber Rudd to make sure ""justice is served for everyone on the estate"" following the Grenfell fire. ""The investigation must leave no stone unturned,"" said the letter, written on behalf of the residents of Hurstway, Testerton, Barandon and Grenfell Walks on the Lancaster West estate. ""It must identify each and every individual and organisation who must bear responsibility and accountability for this tragedy and the mishandling of the aftermath."" The residents' group, which is part of the Justice4Grenfell campaign, also lamented what it called ""the paucity of support"" families received by the state in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. Sky's senior political correspondent Beth Rigby said the letter reflects ""concerns not enough is being done, or not enough information is being shared, or indeed worries that people won't bear responsibility for this awful tragedy"". She added: ""There is a sense of mistrust between the people and the Government."" The number of displaced households now in emergency accommodation following the fire has risen to 386, the Grenfell Response Team said."

The lack of sprinklers at Grenfell Tower is expected to be addressed by the forthcoming public inquiry. :: May wants 'major national investigation' after Grenfell Also on the independent panel appointed by the Government is the Chief Executive of BRE, the company which has a contract worth hundreds of thousands of pounds with the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) to carry out fire investigations and influence building regulations. As Sky News exclusively revealed, the same company told the Government last year that building regulations were adequate. The crisis has now spread to the Scottish Parliament - MSPs were told last week Scotland's more stringent building controls banned plastic-filled cladding on high-rise accommodation. Now Edinburgh Napier university has admitted that its Bainfield student accommodation block has to have its cladding removed. Tests ordered by the Government on cladding from high-rise blocks around the country are shrouded in secrecy - DCLG refuse to say what standard of combustibility test is being conducted, but the Prime Minister says they have convinced her of the need for a national investigation. Meanwhile, Sky News has uncovered research that questions the European safety certification of widely used insulation panels containing the same PIR plastic used behind the cladding at Grenfell Tower. Insurers IF, who conducted tests with Lancashire Fire and Rescue in 2014, say in the real world they burned more fiercely than they did in testing laboratories. IF's report concluded: ""The performance of PIR panels was not as would have been expected given their classification."" DCLG has not asked any local authorities for insulation samples, despite the manufacturer of the insulation at Grenfell Tower withdrawing the specific product from sale and a Sky News report showed that it released deadly hydrogen cyanide gas. The Government's independent panel will have its first meeting this week."

2017-06-27,"Patient care could suffer if the current 1% cap for NHS staff is not lifted, former Conservative health secretary Stephen Dorrell has told Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170627202721/http://news.sky.com/story/warning-over-unsustainable-nhs-staff-1-pay-cap-10928299,"Mr Dorrell, who served in John Major's government and is now the chairman of the NHS Confederation, said the cap would be ""unsustainable"" if it applied for the full five-year course of this Parliament, and that employers shared the concern of NHS and public sector unions. The Royal College of Nurses will today stage protests across the country calling for an end to the pay restraint that has seen public sector pay frozen or capped at one per cent for the last seven years. The RCN says that equates to a 14% pay cut in real terms, and is fuelling a recruitment crisis in the NHS. Mr Dorrell said the cap was limiting employers' ability to recruit and retain staff. ""I absolutely think that the 1% pay cap if applied throughout this parliament is not sustainable, and it's not compatible with delivering high quality health care,"" he said. ""The Royal College of Nursing will make that point on behalf of nurses, and other trade unions will do the same on behalf of their members, but it is important to recognise it is not just a trade union point-of-view. ""It is the view of employers within the system so they can compete for and retain the commitment of high quality staff, and deliver high-quality healthcare."" In March the Government approved a 1% pay rise for 5.1m public sector workers, but since the election there have been indications its commitment to pay restraint may be shifting. Earlier this month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the NHS Confederation annual conference that he had sympathy with the nurses' case and would raise the issue with Chancellor Philip Hammond. :: Hospitals break temporary doctor pay caps 240,000 times Mr Hammond has also said that the Government ""is not deaf"" to calls for an end to pay restraint and Michael Gove said on his return to the Cabinet that austerity may have to be ""eased"". Paul Johnson, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the new political climate allied to the effects of seven years of pay restraint means the cap may have to be abandoned. He said: ""It is a tough balancing act with the public finances. :: Labour pledges NHS pay rises to tackle staff shortages ""You can't afford to not pay what you need to get enough people to be the nurses, teachers and doctors, but you can't pay so much it makes a hole in the public finances. ""Up to now that balance hasn't been too bad, but going forward it is going to be hard to keep public sector pay down because the level of it relative to what is happening in the private sector is set to fall quite fast."" The RCN protest comes as NHS Trusts warn there has been a lack of action to address areas of concern, including social care. A report by NHS Providers, which represents trusts in England, has found that £1bn extra funding for social care is not being used for that purpose. A survey of trusts found that only one in four had a commitment from their local authority that the money would be used to reduce ""bed-blocking"" and less than half thought the money would help them reduce winter pressures."

But Sir Michael Fallon said the deal had to be done. ""We can't take a chance,"" he told Sky News, saying the Government needs to get on ""with these huge things like negotiating Brexit, making sure we build up our defences, keeping the economy going"". He continued: ""And on these big issue we want to be very sure that if there is ever a vote in the House of Commons we can rely on the DUP for support."" ""That's important - to ensure this Government can go forward over the five years of this Parliament knowing on the really big issues that it can't suddenly be ambushed late at night."" :: How Northern Ireland's extra £1bn will be spent Under the confidence-and-supply agreement, about £1bn in ""new money"" has been earmarked for Northern Ireland, as well as greater flexibility over £500m already allocated to the country. In return, the Conservatives will receive support from the DUP's 10 MPs on key votes in the Commons - including those relating to the Queen's Speech, the Budget, national security and Brexit. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones described the cash injection as a ""straight bung to keep a weak Prime Minister and a faltering Government in office"". Plaid Cymru went one further, and said Wales should receive a £1.7bn boost in funding given it has a larger population. And the Scottish National Party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Scotland should get ""its fair share"". Slamming the ""grubby"" agreement, Mr Blackford said: ""For years the Tories have been cutting budgets and services, but suddenly they have found a magic money tree to help them stay in power."" :: Tory-DUP deal: What it says and what it means Although Sinn Fein said the deal could help public services, the party warned it is providing Mrs May with a ""blank cheque"" for a Brexit which threatens peace in Northern Ireland. Sir Michael asserted it would be good for Northern Ireland and the country as a whole. ""This is not money for the DUP, this is money for Northern Ireland, all the parties in Northern Ireland will benefit. It's investment in Northern Ireland, in its infrastructure, broadband, transport. ""We've all got an interest in Northern Ireland becoming as prosperous, as safe as we are in England."" The Commons will vote on the Queen's Speech this week."

Christopher Halliwell is serving a life sentence for the murders of 20-year-old Becky Godden and 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan. Halliwell led detectives to where he had buried Miss O'Callaghan, who he abducted in his taxi as she made her way home from a nightclub in Swindon in March 2011. He then confessed to another murder, taking police to the location of 20-year-old prostitute Miss Godden, who disappeared in 2003. Halliwell had picked up Miss Godden in Swindon, had sex with her and then strangled her before leaving her naked body in a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire. But the detective who was at the centre of the investigation into Halliwell fears there may be more victims. Detective Fulcher wrote in his new book, Catching A Serial Killer: ""At the bottom of a pond that was 8ft deep they found Sian O'Callaghan's distinctive boot. ""Yet that wasn't all. Halliwell had been busy. Buried around the pond were more items of women's clothing. ""I wondered, did they belong to the six other victims I suspected Halliwell of killing? But I had my maths wrong. ""Around the pond were not six other items of women's clothing. There were 60. Halliwell might have been far more prolific than even I had feared,"" he wrote. During the trial, the court heard that it was not possible to determine the cause of Miss Godden's death as her remains had become ""completely skeletonised"". At the time of the trial, Detective Superintendent Sean Memory said he couldn't rule out that Halliwell didn't commit any more murders in the eight years between the deaths of Miss Godden and Miss O'Callaghan. Detective Memory said: ""He talked candidly in 1985 about wanting to be a serial killer and I genuinely believe that's a distinct possibility."" Police began searching Halliwell's former home in February this year based on intelligence officers had received, but said nothing of significant interest was found."

The school said the trip was to help pupils understand why more police officers are on the streets. However, some parents said they were a ""bit horrified"" by the photograph of their children using fake firearms. On Facebook, Lyn Turner wrote: ""I'm not comfortable with this at all. Primary school kids? ""Parents don't like buying toy guns let alone showing them real ones. Not sure about this at all."" But Claire Milliner, a parent of one of children on the trip, wrote: ""Thank you for taking the time out to spend with our children, normalise police presence and make them feel safer."" The police force had opened its doors to the class as a way of thanking pupils who had written to officers following recent terror attacks. The children were also given the chance to dress up in riot gear, talk to officers about their jobs and see police sirens in action. Dawn Chapman, the school's deputy head, said: ""After the awful events in Manchester and London we were talking in class about how to stay safe and who protects us. ""Many of the children had said how they'd seen more police in Birmingham and officers carrying guns. ""We wanted to stress to them that they shouldn't feel scared and that the officers were there to keep people safe."" Sergeant Mike Dunbar, of Birmingham Police, added that ""the last thing we want"" is for children to be scared of police, or to see officers as an ""intimidating authority figure"". He said: ""You can see from the photos and from the looks on the kids' faces on the day that they all had a wonderful time. ""They were our VIPs for the day and it was a pleasure to host them."""
2017-06-27,One lesson from political agreements involving Northern Ireland is the devil is in the detail - or conspicuously not.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170627202721/http://news.sky.com/story/tory-dup-deal-what-the-agreement-says-and-what-it-actually-means-10928149,"So what does the deal the Conservative Party has struck with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) say and - more importantly - what does it actually mean in practice? Firstly, there is the question of the cash - £1.5bn of it in total: £1bn in new money and £500m previously agreed but never released due to political stalemate. How has the Government added that sum to Northern Ireland's Block Grant without using the Barnett Formula - the mechanism for the allocation of funds across the UK's other devolved regions, Scotland and Wales? Well, according to sources close to the negotiations, it is because the Barnett Formula is ""advisory"" - a convention, rather than something enshrined in legislation. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggested that ""any sense of fairness"" had been ""sacrificed on the altar"" of a ""grubby DUP deal to let the PM cling to power"". :: How Northern Ireland's extra £1bn will be spent The second question is one of influence. How much sway will the DUP hold as a result of this confidence and supply arrangement with the Tories? The short answer is: a lot. The establishment of a ""co-ordination committee"" gives the Northern Ireland party a much greater say on legislation and, most notably, on Brexit. Thirdly, some have suggested the financial package is provisional upon the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland at the earliest opportunity. That is simply not the case. Both parties ""recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland's history"" and ""agree the need for additional support"", as outlined. It is those ""unique circumstances"" that create the potential for direct rule so Sky News understands the agreement will stand regardless of the outcome at Stormont. But make no mistake about it. This deal piles huge pressure on Northern Ireland's political parties to reach their own power-sharing agreement before Thursday's deadline. The Government says it hopes this will help them do that. What it means is it hopes the money the DUP is bringing home will entice Sinn Fein back into Stormont."

His head was thrown back by the impact, shattering the vehicle's windscreen, but moments later he got up, seemingly unharmed. Astonishing CCTV footage shows him calmly walking into a bar moments later before sitting down in the doorway where bystanders, including a man wearing a Reading Buses top, rushed to offer help. Daniel Fraifeld, 50, who co-owns the Purple Turtle bar, said: ""I think he (Simon) pretty much got up, brushed himself down and then an ambulance came and took him to be checked. ""He got looked over and didn't have any lasting injuries - but he's covered in scrapes and bruises. He then got released from the hospital and I think he just went for a pint to relax."" The cause of the crash, which happened as Mr Smith crossed Gun Street at around 9am, is not known. A Reading Buses spokesman said the driver had been ""taken off the road"" while an investigation is carried out. He added: ""We are obviously shocked by the incident as well as the very graphic footage... Thankfully, the pedestrian does not have any major injuries and there were no major injuries to passengers on the bus. ""We send our regrets to those affected, especially the pedestrian injured in the street, and hope that he is recovering from his injuries."" The bus also hit a bin and a building and then the wall of St Mary's Minister, coming to a rest in the middle of the road, surrounded by rubble. A second person was also injured by debris and taken to Royal Berkshire Hospital for further treatment."

He said: ""It made me feel uncomfortable. It was pushing me in and out. It was like I couldn't control my own body. The top seemed calm but below it was different."" Mr Deacon, who was in the water with three children and their dinghy at Camber Sands, described the current: ""It unnerved me. ""I just headed back towards the beach as I had three children with me. I wouldn't have gone to the beach if I knew it was like that."" He told the inquest in Hastings that there were ""lots of pockets of shallow and deep holes"", and added: ""You couldn't tell when these pockets would appear."" There were no warning notices about the nature of the sands and no flag was flying on 24 August 2016, the day of the tragedy, Mr Deacon said. The only warning was about the possibility of jellyfish. Mr Deacon said later that day he saw five Asian men chest-deep in the water apparently playing volleyball before he later saw a Coastguard helicopter. The five men who drowned were fit, healthy and competent swimmers and some had visited the beach at Camber before without any problems, the inquest has been told. The five victims were Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, and his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both of Erith, southeast London, and their friends Nitharsan Ravi, 22, of Plumstead, southeast London, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, of Grays, Essex, and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, of Welling, southeast London. Two other people also lost their lives about a month before the five men died. They were Mohit Dupar, 36, from Hayes, west London, who tried to reach Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, as he got into difficulty, but both men died. Their deaths are also being considered as part of the inquest into the five friends' loss of life. The deaths triggered calls for safety to be boosted at Camber and Rother District Council agreed in February to allocate £51,000 for seasonal lifeguard cover which started this summer but officials have said the beach, which is three miles (4.8km) long and nearly half a mile (700m) wide at low tide, could never be completely risk-free. Beach patrol officers were involved mainly in land and beach-related issues, including reuniting lost children with their parents and issuing sandbar warnings, the inquest heard. The inquest continues."

Figures show the monarchy also spent £1m on ceiling inspections and £1.5m on food and drink hospitality within the royal households. Meanwhile, travel expenses for the royal family topped £4.5m - including a £154,000 trip to Italy, Romania and Austria made by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall in April. The Queen is said to keep an eye on travel expenses, which she has to sign off on, and is known to ""have a word"" if they seem too costly, according to palace officials. Other costly trips included the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's state visit to India and Bhutan (£97,703), and the Duke of York's trip to Mozambique and Botswana (£54,000). The Royal Train was also expensive, with £288,697 spent on just 14 trips. One of those visits was made by the Duke of Edinburgh to an anniversary dinner in Devon, which cost £18,690. A royal source said: ""We believe that, though it's not the cheapest way to travel, it does represent many of the features that we look for in terms of safety, security, not causing disruption to lots of other people - convenience - environmental aspects it's strong on as well."" The annual accounts show the Queen's expenditure was £41.9m last year. It came as the Crown Estate's profits jumped by 8% to £328.8m, while the Prince of Wales' private income from the Duchy of Cornwall was £20.7m. Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse, said the Sovereign Grant paid to the Queen equated to 65p per person in the UK. He said: ""Consider that against what the Queen does and represents for this country, I believe it represents excellent value for money."" Graham Smith, chief executive of campaign group Republic, claimed the actual cost of the crown was around £345m.

Although his signs were speedily taken down, locals in the West Allotment area of North Tyneside continued to refer to the shop as ""Singhsbury's"" nonetheless. After nearly five years without a sign, the businessman spotted an opportunity to rebrand when the Post Office next door shut down - allowing him to expand. With his new Morrisinghs sign proudly in place, Mr Nagra told Sky News: ""We recently did a shop refit and I thought now is the time to do it. I had the name in my head for quite a while. ""There has been some negative feedback on social media, but it is a bit of fun and banter. We're British. This is us. We've always had this sense of humour.

But Morrisons has told Sky News that they are happy to shelve the matter and endure a little friendly rivalry. ""Mr Nagra and his customers obviously have good taste so we wish him well,"" a Morrisons spokesman said. The local businessman is now hoping that Morrisinghs will put West Allotment on the map, even if it may take a while for his customers to get used to the rebrand. A Sainsbury's spokesperson told Sky News: ""We were grateful to Mr Nagra for removing the sign."""

They include ""woke"" which is used as an adjective to mean ""alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice"", and ""thing"" when used to express disbelief, as in ""how can that be a thing?"" There are also 50 new terms relating to tennis, such as ""tennis mom"" and ""tennis dad"" to describe parents who encourage their children to play the sport. Post-truth has also entered the dictionary and is defined as ""relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping political debate or public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief"". Explaining how a word qualifies for inclusion, the OED said: ""We require several independent examples of the word being used, and also evidence that the word has been in use for a reasonable amount of time."""
2017-06-27,The largest warship ever built in the UK eased into the Firth of Forth as it set out on two years of sea trials ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170627202721/http://news.sky.com/story/royal-navys-largest-ever-warship-hms-queen-elizabeth-sets-sail-10927338,"HMS Queen Elizabeth, the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier, left her dock in Scotland in a delicate operation that took around three hours. She is named after Elizabeth the first and is the second ship to carry the name - the first was a First World War battleship. :: Over 3 football pitches long: HMS Queen Elizabeth facts More than 700 crew are onboard, from seamen to aircraft engineers, dentists to force protection. The oldest crew member is 58 and the youngest 17, although the average age is in the early twenties. In recent weeks they have been practising drills and familiarising themselves with their new ship. Sailing her out of the basin she was built in needed precise calculations and nerves of steel. At high tide, she was guided through a narrow exit in the harbour. This had been widened but still only allowed 14 inches either side to spare. Under the water line there was just half a metre between the bottom of the ship and the seabed. :: The Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier in 360° The carrier then dropped anchor after just a few hundred metres. At low tide, she will make her approach towards the three Forth bridges close to midnight, sailing at 3-4 knots; any faster and suction will pull her downwards into the river - an effect known as 'squat'. The first two road bridges can flex by up to three metres in high winds but the third, the iconic Forth Bridge, poses its own challenge - height. A radar mast will be hydraulically lowered to make room for the ship to pass underneath. Even so, were a person to stand on the highest point of her, and reach up, they would be able to touch the Forth Bridge as they sailed through. ""It is like driving your car into a car park you go 'oh my god' and dip in your seat. It is exactly the same feeling as that,"" said Captain Jerry Kyd, who has previously commanded the UK's last two aircraft carriers HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious. The whole process could take more than 10 hours. The following six weeks will be spent in the North Sea and Moray Firth ""proving systems"" - she will finally sail into her home port of Portsmouth sometime in the autumn. Flight trials will begin off the eastern seaboard of the United States in October 2018. HMS Queen Elizabeth has taken more than eight years to build and is the first of two new carriers for the Navy; a second, the Prince of Wales, will follow in two years' time. Together they will cost over £6bn, a price tag which the ship's first commanding officer defends as value for money. ""You look at all the premier nations around the world and why is it that every nation in the top tier are investing billions of dollars in aircraft carriers? Is it just us or has everyone got it wrong here?"" Cptn Kyd points out. ""The reason being is they provide the government, very simply, with an incredibly flexible tool that is not just about war fighting. ""This is about deterrence, coercion, political signalling and providing a huge sea base - don't forget it is not a ship - it is a sea base for disaster relief, humanitarian assistance, defence engagement and selling British industry abroad."""
2017-06-27,Sir Vince Cable looks likely to become Liberal Democrat leader after all the party's senior MPs ruled themselves out of the race.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170627202721/http://news.sky.com/story/sir-vince-cable-likely-to-become-lib-dem-leader-10929213,"Nominations for the contest close on 20 July, but after former cabinet minister Sir Ed Davey said he would not run, Sir Vince appears to be on course as the only declared candidate. The contest to succeed Tim Farron is open to all 12 Lib Dem MPs, who must secure the support of two colleagues to stand. Deputy leader Jo Swinson, chief whip Alistair Carmichael, Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, healthy spokesman Norman Lamb and work and pensions spokesman Stephen Lloyd have all ruled themselves out. A senior Lib Dem source said they would be ""surprised"" if any of the other party MPs - Wera Hobhouse, Jamie Stone, Christine Jardine and Layla Moran - stood for the leadership after they only entered the Commons this month. Mr Farron triggered the leadership contest after announcing he was quitting because he had been unable to reconcile his Christian faith with the demands of leading a ""progressive, liberal"" party. Sir Ed said he made his decision during a camping trip with his wife Emily and children. Writing on the Liberal Democrat Voice website, he said: ""I've come back to Westminster more determined than ever to campaign hard for the party Emily and I both love, but not to campaign to lead the party at this moment."" He added: ""So my decision not to stand now... is a difficult one, but it is rooted in my family: the need to be there for my young children and not continually away from home; the need to protect my family from the inevitable intrusion on our lives; and the need to protect myself from pressures that would otherwise compromise my job as a father while they are still so young."" Sir Vince reacted to the announcement, tweeting: ""Very much admire & respect what my friend & colleague @EdwardJDavey has said today on Lib Dem Voice about the importance of family."""
2017-06-27,Shrewsbury Town are aiming to become the first English football club with an all-seater stadium to bring in safe standing.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170627202721/http://news.sky.com/story/safe-standing-area-could-be-tested-at-league-one-club-shrewsbury-town-10929207,"Plans have been made to install rail seats, which allow the seat to be locked into an upright position, and to have a safety barrier on every row. This would allow fans of the League One club to stand between rows. Standing was banned in England's top two divisions - the Premier League and Championship - following the Taylor Inquiry into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. All-seater stadiums legislation permits clubs in Leagues One and Two to keep terraces that existed before 1994. If approved by the Sports Ground Safety Authority, Shrewsbury's Greenhous Meadow, which is just 10 years old, will be the first modern football stadium in England to have standing. The English Football League has welcomed Shrewsbury's application, which the club is seeking to finance via crowdfunding. If successful, the new seats will be installed in the Salop Leisure Stand in their 10,000-capacity ground. The League One club are hoping to have 500 such seats fitted and in use before the end of the 2017/18 season. EFL chief executive Shaun Harvey said: ""This is an important step on the journey towards our stated aim of seeing standing in stadiums across the EFL and I wish Shrewsbury Town every success in reaching their crowdfunding target to support their application. ""The installation of standing accommodation will be popular with the club's fans and, more widely, will prove a valuable opportunity to assess the use of this form of accommodation at an English football ground."" Shrewsbury's supporters' parliament joint-chair Roger Groves said: ""There's a clear demand from our fans for an area where they can stand safely. ""We see that at every game with several hundred choosing to stand at their seats, which is not altogether safe. Rail seats will ensure that nobody falls over no matter how wildly they celebrate a goal and, by having a dedicated standing area, we believe that the overall atmosphere in the stadium will also be enhanced."" Scottish champions Celtic have already implemented a 2,900-capacity safe standing section at their Celtic Park stadium. The Premier League has written to all 20 clubs asking if they would be interested in taking part in a trial to test safe-standing, with West Brom having already volunteered to sign up."

The accused, who is from Cardiff, spoke only to confirm his identity. His lawyers made no application for bail and he was remanded in custody. Osborne is scheduled to appear again at the Old Bailey on July 20 for another procedural hearing."
2017-06-27,Google has been ordered to pay a record fine of £2.1bn (€2.42bn) for abusing its dominance as a search engine to boost its shopping comparison service.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170627202721/http://news.sky.com/story/google-fined-record-1632bn-over-shopping-service-10928652,"The European competition watchdog said the company had breached anti-trust rules. It said Google's search engine had systematically given prominence to its own comparison shopping service over others, so that it was displayed at or near the top of search results. The company has been ordered to end the conduct at the centre of the European Commission probe or face penalty payments of up to 5% of the average daily turnover of parent company Alphabet. Google said it ""respectfully"" disagreed with the ruling and would review the decision in detail as it considers an appeal. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said Google's innovative products and services had been ""a good thing"" but its strategy for attracting customers to its online shopping service was not just about being better than rivals. ""Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors,"" she said. ""What Google has done is illegal under EU anti-trust rules. ""It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. ""And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation."" Google earns 90% of its revenue from adverts shown to consumers in response to a search engine query, the EC ruling said. But in 2004 it entered the separate market of comparison shopping in Europe - a service first called Froogle, later known as Google Product Search, then Google Shopping. It allows consumers to compare products and prices online and find deals from all types of retailers. When Google entered this market there were already a number of established players and its initial market performance was ""relatively poor"", the EC said, and from 2008 it began to implement a ""fundamental change in strategy"". The ruling found that search results gave prominence to Google's own shopping service and demoted rivals, giving it a ""significant advantage"". Google's comparison service was then found to have made significant gains in traffic at the expense of its rivals, with a 45-fold increase in the UK, 35-fold in Germany and 19-fold in France. Rival websites saw declines of 85% in the UK, up to 92% in Germany and 80% in France - sudden drops which the commission said could not be explained by other factors. Google has now been told it must ""apply the same processes and methods to position and display rival comparison shopping services in Google's search result pages as it gives to its own comparison shopping service"". The EC has already come to preliminary conclusions in two separate cases - involving the Android operating system and the AdSense advertising platform - that Google has abused a dominant position. Google senior vice president Kent Walker said: ""When you use Google to search for products, we try to give you what you're looking for. ""Our ability to do that well isn't favouring ourselves, or any particular site or seller - it's the result of hard work and constant innovation, based on user feedback. ""Given the evidence, we respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. ""We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case."" Google said the EC should have considered another reason why rival shopping services may not have done so well - because major retail platforms such as Amazon had instead become the first port of call for product searches."

The so-called ""war on terrier"" was sparked when Barnaby Joyce, Australia's deputy prime minister, threatened to have the dogs killed unless they ""bugger back off to the United States"". Depp responded in the row by calling the politician a ""sweaty, big-gutted man from Australia"", but they had the dogs flown out of the country hours before a deadline set by the government. The couple later issued a bizarre apology video which was widely mocked. Heard was handed a $1,000 (£541) fine after pleading guilty to providing a false immigration document which failed to declare her dogs. The actress had two other, more serious charges of illegally importing the terriers into the country dismissed. The couple, who finalised their divorce earlier this year, claimed to have been unaware they were breaking any laws and said they thought their ""staff had obtained the necessary paperwork"". But now Depp's former business managers, The Management Group, have filed legal documents in a separate case alleging the actor ""falsely claimed to authorities and public press interviews that the incident was a big misunderstanding"" - and pressured his long-term employees to ""take the fall"". Responding to the claim, Mr Joyce said he ""might have to look at this"". ""If the allegation is correct, there is a word for that - it is called perjury,"" he told ABC News. ""That is another question that, if that was true, Mr Depp would have to answer for. ""We're an island continent and we take biosecurity very seriously and it doesn't matter if you think that you're Mr Who's Who of Hollywood, you're going to obey our laws,"" added Mr Joyce, who is also agricultural minister and often seen wearing cowboy hats. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull saw the lighter side, quipping to a Sydney radio station: ""I wouldn't want to come between Johnny and Barnaby... sort of the pirate meets the cowboy. ""Maybe they could make a movie together,"" he added."

The letter comes a day after inquests into the deaths of four of the fire victims were opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner's Court. Meanwhile, cladding on 75 tower blocks in 26 local authority areas has failed fire safety tests. The residents' group, which is part of the Justice4Grenfell campaign, said: ""We support the survivors and mourn the dead - they are our families, friends and neighbours, many of whom are still missing. ""We want to ensure that justice is served for everyone on the estate. ""We therefore demand that our voices are heard and fully included in the inquiry."""

Specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital think the 10-month-old has no chance of survival and want to end his life support treatment. But his parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, from Bedfont, west London want him to undergo a therapy trial in the US. On 19 June, judges at the ECHR ordered doctors to continue treatment while they considered the complex case. But they have now announced the application by Charlie's parents is ""inadmissible"". The European Court announced that it had by a majority ""endorsed in substance"" the approach by the UK courts. It added that the court ""also considered that it was appropriate to lift the interim measure"" which had required doctors to continue providing life support treatment to Charlie. Great Ormond Street said there would be ""no rush"" to change Charlie's treatment ""and any future treatment plans will involve careful planning and discussion"". ""Our thoughts are with Charlie's parents on receipt of this news that we know will be very distressing for them. ""Today's decision by the European Court of Human Rights marks the end of what has been a very difficult process and our priority is to provide every possible support to Charlie's parents as we prepare for the next steps."" A High Court judge ruled against Charlie's family in April, a decision backed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. The ECHR said the British courts had concluded ""on the basis of extensive, high-quality expert evidence, that it was most likely Charlie was being exposed to continued pain, suffering and distress and that undergoing experimental treatment with no prospects of success would offer no benefit, and continue to cause him significant harm""."

The heat wave boosted sales of traditional summer categories such as ice cream - up 12% - and cider - up by 16% - together adding £58m to revenues. Kantar's figures do not extend to last week, when Britain experienced its warmest June day since 1976. The acceleration in sales growth was also helped by a further uptick in grocery inflation, which climbed to 3.2%, its highest level since November 2013. That adds an equivalent to £133 to the average annual shopping bill, with the highest rises seen in products such as butter - up 20% - and fish - up 14%. Price rises in supermarkets have been accelerating this year after more than two years of deflation. However, food and drink retailers seem to have been less adversely affected than other sectors with consumers apparently prioritising essential purchases. The big four supermarkets Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons all posted growth in the latest period, led by a 3.7% rise for Morrisons. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued their rapid expansion, each adding just under 19% in sales. Separate industry data from Nielsen also highlighted the impact of the warm weather, with sales for the four weeks to 17 June up 4% year-on-year, including an especially strong final week, helped by drinks, frozen food and ice cream. Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said: ""The early summer weather gave supermarkets a much-needed shot on the arm."""

Asked if the UK would leave the customs union, he replied: ""I would have thought so."" Mr Davis said any transition period was likely to end by 2022 as ""the most important thing is it's got to be done before the election"". And he said any transition arrangements will not extend to trade. :: Scots referendum on hold until Brexit 'clearer' This stance appears at odds with that of Chancellor Philip Hammond, who earlier repeated his call for any transitional deal to avoid a ""disruptive and dangerous cliff edge"" in trading links with the EU after Brexit. Speaking in Berlin to the CDU Economic Council, Mr Hammond said there must be a ""smooth and orderly path"" to new arrangements under Brexit. He said: ""Early agreement on these transitional arrangements so that trade between our countries can carry on flowing smoothly will reduce uncertainty, unlock investment decisions, business confidence and protect jobs and prosperity, in Britain, in Germany and across this continent."" But Mr Davis described the comments by Mr Hammond on the timescale as ""not quite consistent with one another"". Under the Government's plan to extend rights to EU citizens already living in the UK, Mr Davis said there would be ""practically no burden"" on businesses. He said: ""My job is to bring back control of migration to Westminster. ""It is not to slam the door on immigration. ""We will bring immigration down but in a way and at a pace that does not cause labour shortages or, worse, undermine the nation's need for new talent."" Downing Street insisted the length of any transition or implementation phase will form part of Brexit negotiations. A Number 10 spokeswoman said: ""It's not in anyone's interest for there to be a cliff-edge. We want to give certainty to businesses. That's the position of David Davis and Philip Hammond also. ""What the Prime Minister has been clear about is that clearly leaving the EU means we will be leaving the Customs Union. ""What that looks like and the phases of implementation and so on will all be subject to negotiation."" Roland Rudd, chairman of Open Britain which campaigns against a hard Brexit, said: ""To protect our economy during the Brexit process, it is vital that the Government negotiates a transitional period that keeps Britain in the single market and customs union until a trade deal that gives us the 'exact same benefits' can be negotiated. ""It is truly concerning that the Brexit Secretary appears to have ruled this out."""

The 2009 film saw him play an investigative journalist who works with computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, a role played by Noomi Rapace. The success of the series inspired an American film adaptation, which was released two years later. Daniel Craig took over Nyqvist's role as Blomkvist, and Rooney Mara starred as Lisbeth Salander.

The contraceptive is now available at more than 200 Superdrug pharmacies as well as its online doctor service. Michael Henry, healthcare director at the retailer, said: ""We're committed to leading the way in sexual health and offering a generic emergency contraceptive pill at half the price of what's currently available on the high street. ""Its availability will give women more choice and access to this medication at a time when they are most in need."" Until now, women could only get hold of the emergency contraception through an appointment with their GP or by paying around £28 at the pharmacy. Women buying the pill through pharmacists often need to have a consultation before they are sold the pill, where they are asked questions about the incident - something which has been criticised for making women feel uncomfortable and less likely to seek help when they need it. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) has campaigned on the issue, calling for a move that would help women get easier access to the medicine. But critics raised concerns about how many women could use the emergency contraception casually and too often. Dr Pixie McKenna, Superdrug's health and wellbeing ambassador, and star of Embarrassing Bodies, told Sky News: ""The clue is in the terminology - it's for emergencies only and should never be taken more than once in the same cycle. ""If you find yourself taking it on a regular basis it's a sign you need regular contraception, plus you are of course also at risk of STIs, so need a screen."" Dr McKenna says the contraceptive will not be less effective just because it costs less, but can retail at a cheaper price because it does not carry the branding of those available from the chemist. Ann Furedi, chief executive of the BPAS, said: ""We are delighted Superdrug has taken this trailblazing step, and look forward to other major retailers following its lead. ""We know the high cost of emergency contraception can be a major barrier to women accessing it when their regular method fails."" The morning after pill delays the ovaries from releasing an egg and is taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex or if a usual contraceptive has failed."

Astonishing CCTV footage shows him calmly walking into a bar moments later before sitting down in the doorway where bystanders, including a man wearing a Reading Buses top, rushed to offer help. Daniel Fraifeld, 50, who co-owns the Purple Turtle bar, said: ""I think he (Simon) pretty much got up, brushed himself down and then an ambulance came and took him to be checked. ""He got looked over and didn't have any lasting injuries - but he's covered in scrapes and bruises. He then got released from the hospital and I think he just went for a pint to relax."" The cause of the crash, which happened as Mr Smith crossed Gun Street at around 9am, is not known. A Reading Buses spokesman said the driver had been ""taken off the road"" while an investigation is carried out. He added: ""We are obviously shocked by the incident as well as the very graphic footage...

The bus also hit a bin and a building and then the wall of St Mary's Minister, coming to a rest in the middle of the road, surrounded by rubble. A second person was also injured by debris and taken to Royal Berkshire Hospital for further treatment."

We want supermarkets to create a plastic-free aisle. ""You can now buy wheat-free, gluten-free, fat-free but you can't buy plastic-free"". She asked: ""When did it become okay to wrap something as perishable as food in something as indestructible as plastic?"" The group is encouraging supermarkets to look at alternative options such as new technologies like bio-plastics and more familiar options such as wax-free paper and card. Ms Sutherland said: ""The average length of time single-use plastic is useful is 11 minutes, and then it exists on our planet forever. It's completely bonkers."" While plastic is a relatively cheap material to produce, campaigners believe the true cost of plastic - once recycling, landfill and council collection costs are factored in - is actually much higher than introducing alternative packaging at the outset. A group of MPs from across the political spectrum has also recently backed calls for a business rate relief scheme for supermarkets that introduce at least one plastic-free aisle. Every day eight million tonnes of plastic is dumped into oceans and it is estimated by 2050 there will be more plastic by weight in the sea than fish. Some scientists believe plastics are having an impact on people's health as they become exposed to chemicals such as phthalate and BPA - an industrial chemical used to make plastics - which may cause cancer, metabolic and cognitive behaviour disorders. Sky News launched its Sky Ocean Rescue campaign earlier this year aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the world's seas. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"

2017-06-28,The Government survived Wednesday night's vote on the Queen's Speech - but actually winning is another matter entirely.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170628210910/http://news.sky.com/story/government-survives-queens-speech-vote-but-is-far-from-winning-10930558,"Everybody these days supports hard-working public servants and, in particular, the emergency services after the horrors of Manchester, London Bridge and Grenfell Tower. On Wednesday, in the first test of her minority Government, the Prime Minister passed. Her Government won 323-309 on the Opposition amendment to scrap the public sector pay cap, with Theresa May dependent on her DUP allies to defeat Labour's proposal. The £1bn payout to Northern Ireland yielded returns for the Treasury by preventing a pay rise that would have cost £4bn. But this was a small win on a day of confusion over the seven years old austerity policy. Cabinet ministers such as Defence Secretary Michael Fallon hinted at a change in the morning, which set the hares running. Then, just after Prime Minister's Questions, Number 10 told journalists the Government had ""heard the message"" of a public weary with austerity and hinted at a review in time for autumn's Budget. Yet, three hours later, Downing Street insisted 15 times ""the policy has not changed"". It was something of a U-turn on a U-turn and had all the hallmarks of the Treasury's intervention. This is what happens when painful parliamentary arithmetic meets painful deficit reduction. In the debate on the Queen's Speech, Labour criticised the lack of clarity on public sector pay with shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth declaring the Government could not even execute a U-turn competently. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted the Government ""will not make our decision on public sector pay until the pay review body has reported and we listen to what they say"". Ministers have ignored those recommendations in recent years but Mr Hunt also said the Government would listen to Parliament. Tory MPs who voted with the Government against the Labour amendment actually back scrapping the public sector cap. Johnny Mercer, MP for Plymouth Moor View, said he would be campaigning for public sector workers to get a larger than 1% annual pay rise, while South Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen also expressed concern about the cap. In any event, public servants sense a change in the weather on austerity after the General Election - raising the prospect of strikes. The bigger point here is that Wednesday's vote illustrates how it will take just seven Tory MPs to rebel on anything for this Government to lose its majority. And it need not even get to that. If Conservative whips believe seven MPs might rebel, or 14 MPs might abstain, the Tory majority is gone. On this basis there is no way an actual vote on public sector pay - rather than a Queen's Speech amendment - would have passed. Today and tomorrow is about survival. The Government is far from winning much just yet."
2017-06-28,The official UK singles chart is undergoing a shake-up to prevent one artist or group from dominating the majority of the top spots.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170628210910/http://news.sky.com/story/new-uk-singles-chart-rules-to-stop-ed-sheeran-effect-10929620,"The Official Charts Company's new rules prevent the same artist from having more than three songs in the top 100 at the same time. With the rise of streaming, charts have ended up reflecting how many times each individual song was listened to, not necessarily purchased. This means virtually every song from one album can end up dominating the top of the charts. Sixteen tracks of Ed Sheeren's last album Divide appeared in the first 20 spots of the singles list, earlier this year. The phenomenon, while partly attributed to the artist's success, was also due to streaming metrics used by the company to calculate its charts. In December last year, after Drake's One Dance managed 15 weeks at number one, the conversion rate changed from 100 to 150 streams to a sale. The streams-to-sales ratio has been changed again as part of the shake-up in an effort to accelerate the removal of existing songs from the chart. As of 7 July, 300 music streams will count as one sale. According to the Official Charts Company, the changes will ""ensure the chart continues to be a showcase for the new hits and talent which are the lifeblood of UK music"". ""This is not a chart for album tracks; we want to remain the Official Singles Chart, for singles,"" chief executive Martin Talbot told NME. ""It's tougher than ever for new music and developing artists to break through, and this is us doing our bit,"" he added. ""This is about injecting energy back into the chart."" The changes have been agreed by record labels and streaming services across the industry."
2017-06-28,Downing Street has signalled that it will lift the public sector pay cap on the back of Theresa May's election drubbing.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170628210910/http://news.sky.com/story/public-sector-pay-cap-could-be-lifted-number-10-signals-10930132,"A senior Number 10 source said the Prime Minister had ""heard the message"" from the General Election as he signalled a potential climbdown in the autumn. ""Ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, have been clear that they are going to listen to the messages that were sent at the election,"" said the senior source. ""We understand that people are weary after years of hard work to rebuild the economy. ""Public sector pay restraint is one of the tough choices we've had to make to balance the books after Labour's crash and what was left behind. ""We are working through and looking at recommendations from pay bodies that are coming."" However, Downing Street later insisted there had been no change to the Government's policy, with the move described as ""the standard process"" for deciding public sector pay. A possible U-turn would represent a big win for Jeremy Corbyn, who has repeatedly demanded that the cap should be lifted, and MPs will vote on lifting the cap this evening after Labour tabled an amendment to the Queen's Speech. Labour's Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said: ""The British people denied Theresa May a majority in the General Election. ""The Conservatives have no mandate to carry out their damaging cuts to vital public services and attacks on the British people. ""Now, it appears, the dramatic increase in Labour's vote at the General Election and the strength of feeling among the British people may force the Government to U-turn and stop cutting public sector workers' pay."" Mr Gwynne added he would ""look forward"" to Tory MPs supporting the Labour amendment later on Wednesday. Pressure has also been building from the unions, with bodies representing 1.3 million nurses, doctors and health professionals writing to the Prime Minister last month to ask her to end the pay cap. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said, if the cap is indeed lifted, ""it will be a massive victory for trade union campaigning and hard-pressed public servants"". ""It's about time that hard-working public sector workers got the pay rise they've earned,"" she said. ""But this can't be kicked in to the long grass, it needs to happen now. Public sector workers have waited long enough."" Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the Government was ""in full retreat on public sector pay"". ""Nurses, teachers, and our emergency services are on the front line every single day but have had thousands of pounds pinched from their pay packets already. ""They did not create the financial crash but have had to pay the highest price for it. Theresa May should end the cap on public sector pay now,"" he said."

Trevor Hicks, whose daughters Sarah and Vicki were killed, added: ""This is a success for society at large, not just for us."" Evelyn McDonnell Mills lost her brother Peter at the match in 1989. ""I'm really happy that we've finally got some charges after 28 years,"" she said. Ms McDonnell Mills added that the CPS decision was tinged with sadness, as her brother Gerard has passed away without being able to see justice. Marcia Willis-Stewart, a lawyer representing some of the families, said ""now is the time for accountability"". Politicians have also praised the ""exemplary"" campaign led by families of those who lost their lives at the FA Cup semi-final. Theresa May told MPs in the Commons that she welcomes the fact that charging decisions have been made after ""many years of waiting"" for Hillsborough families. The Prime Minister said: ""I know from working closely with the families when I was Home Secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This prosecution, the inquiry, and this development only happened because of the incredible work done by the Hillsborough Justice campaign. ""I think we should pay tribute to all of those who spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those who died at Hillsborough."" :: In full: CPS statement on Hillsborough charges The Liberal Democrats' shadow home secretary, Sir Ed Davey, expressed hope that the establishment has learned lessons from Hillsborough.

She suggested ""good people"" may be put off standing for election to Parliament unless action is taken. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Ms Murray said: ""Over the past months I've had swastikas carved into posters, social media posts like 'burn the witch' and 'stab the c'. ""People put Labour Party posters on my home, photographed them and pushed them through my letter box. And someone even urinated on my office door."" Ms Murray claimed the abuse she suffered during the General Election campaign ""hardly"" represented ""kinder, gentler, politics"" - a slogan of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn when he stood for the leadership of his party. In response, Theresa May told Ms Murray she was ""absolutely right"" to highlight her concerns. The Prime Minister said: ""She is not the only person who experienced this sort of intimidation during the election campaign. ""Particularly, I'm sorry to say, this sort of intimidation was experienced by female candidates during the election campaign. ""I believe this sort of behaviour has no place in our democracy and I think she's right, I think it could put good people off from serving in this House. ""We want more people to become engaged, more people to want to stand for election to this House.""

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre is investigating how many more UK firms have been hit and is ""trying to get an understanding of a fast-moving situation"". :: What is the virus behind cyberattack? Companies in six other countries were also hit, after Ukraine declared it had been struck by the biggest cyberattack in its history. Chernobyl's radiation monitoring system is among the most serious digital networks affected. It has since been shut down, leaving employees to ""go out and measure the (radiation) levels with hand-held meters"". Ukraine's interior ministry said the hack was a modified version of the Wannacry virus - a type of ransomware that crippled NHS computer systems in May. Costin Raiu, head of global research at Kaspersky Lab, the world's biggest cybersecurity analysis firm, identified the virus as Petrwrap. The cryptolocker demands $300 in bitcoins to let users access their data and does not name the encrypting program, which makes finding a solution difficult. Ukraine's security council secretary said an hour after the news broke: ""It is possible to talk of Russian fingerprints.""

The lack of sprinklers at Grenfell Tower is expected to be addressed by the forthcoming public inquiry. :: May wants 'major national investigation' after Grenfell Also on the independent panel appointed by the Government is the Chief Executive of BRE, the company which has a contract worth hundreds of thousands of pounds with the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) to carry out fire investigations and influence building regulations. As Sky News exclusively revealed, the same company told the Government last year that building regulations were adequate. The crisis has now spread to the Scottish Parliament - MSPs were told last week Scotland's more stringent building controls banned plastic-filled cladding on high-rise accommodation. Now Edinburgh Napier university has admitted that its Bainfield student accommodation block has to have its cladding removed. Tests ordered by the Government on cladding from high-rise blocks around the country are shrouded in secrecy - DCLG refuse to say what standard of combustibility test is being conducted, but the Prime Minister says they have convinced her of the need for a national investigation. Meanwhile, Sky News has uncovered research that questions the European safety certification of widely used insulation panels containing the same PIR plastic used behind the cladding at Grenfell Tower. Insurers IF, who conducted tests with Lancashire Fire and Rescue in 2014, say in the real world they burned more fiercely than they did in testing laboratories. IF's report concluded: ""The performance of PIR panels was not as would have been expected given their classification."" DCLG has not asked any local authorities for insulation samples, despite the manufacturer of the insulation at Grenfell Tower withdrawing the specific product from sale and a Sky News report showed that it released deadly hydrogen cyanide gas.

2017-06-28,Ministers are looking at creating a new body to oversee EU citizens' rights in the UK in an effort to break the impasse over whose courts protect EU nationals after Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170628210910/http://news.sky.com/story/ministers-mull-creating-body-to-oversee-eu-citizens-rights-in-uk-10929813,"A Government source told Sky News that a new oversight body for EU citizens was shaping up as a ""serious option"" in a bid to find a compromise between the European Commission and the UK over who should protect EU citizens living in the UK. The issue of legal oversight has become a sticking point in negotiations, with Theresa May rejecting the EU's position that the European Court of Justice should be the arbiter of any future disputes over citizens' rights. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has consistently said he expects the ECJ to enforce the rights of EU citizens in Britain, saying last month that ""the rights in the withdrawal agreement will need to be directly enforceable and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice maintained"". However, the Prime Minister has explicitly rejected that demand, saying in her offer document to EU citizens living in the UK that the ECJ ""will not have jurisdiction in the UK"" after Brexit. The rights of citizens and the UK's exit fees are key areas of the divorce settlement that the EU wants to resolve before talks can begin on the future trade deal between Britain and its largest trading partner. Britain wants an early breakthrough on citizens' rights so it can move onto the next stage of talks. However, the detailed proposals published on Monday had provoked a cool response, with Mr Barnier tweeting that the goal on EU citizens' rights was to have the ""same level of protection as in EU law. More ambition, clarity and guarantees needed that in today's position"". Government sources told Sky News that ""a separate oversight body is a real option"" given that the Prime Minister and her cabinet ""can't budge on the ECJ binding jurisdiction as it doesn't deliver sovereignty"". Two other figures familiar with the discussions also suggested a separate oversight body could be an option, acknowledging that the two sides would have to find some sort of compromise on oversight of citizens. ""This is a negotiation,"" said the figure. ""We have always been explicit that we want to safeguard the rights of EU citizens living in the UK,"" said a source in the Department for Exiting the European Union. ""It is only to be expected that we will keep our options as to how we do that. But we have always been clear that once we leave the European Union the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will end."" Another bone of contention is the post-Brexit rights of EU citizens. The European Commission has demanded that EU citizens living in UK have the right to be joined by family members after Brexit. However, Mrs May on Monday rejected this demand, insisting EU citizens must bring family members over to Britain before Brexit or face tougher immigration rules."

It is also why the Reynobond PE cladding that was used on Grenfell Tower is not thought to have been used on any buildings over 40ft high (approximately four storeys) in the US, despite it being made by an American company. If you want to put metal composite material cladding on a tall building in this country, you have to simulate, quite precisely, how it would perform in a fire. That means getting one of only three certified testing labs to construct a full replica wall using the material, several stories high, complete with a window opening near the base. Testing staff then light a fire so that flames come out through the window and on to the cladding. They watch and measure if, how and where the exterior material burns. If temperatures at the top of the wall exceed 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (537C), it is an automatic fail. Crucially, if flames spread more than 10ft vertically from the top of the window opening or 5ft horizontally, then it is an automatic fail. According to the National Fire Prevention Association, who drafted NFPA-285, the cladding used on Grenfell Tower has never passed their test. NFPA engineer Robert Solomon told Sky News that to the best of his knowledge the NFPA-285 safety protocol is not used in the UK. He believes it that if it had been, then the proposed Grenfell Tower refurbishment materials would never have been allowed. He said: ""Clearly, Grenfell had all these fire safety deficiencies anyway… all these things that would work against you if there were a fire. ""And then the one thing they did in this renovation was make it even worse."""

After spotting customers and bouncers at a nearby bar standing ""like deers in the headlights"", he knew something was wrong. Initially he thought it was a pub fight or a gang fight ""at the most"", but he soon witnessed people being attacked on Borough High Street. PC Marques said: ""I heard a female's scream. It was definitely a woman's scream. I heard one scream that sort of echoed and made its way up London Bridge Street, on my left hand side. ""So I looked down the street and I couldn't see who was screaming. ""But what did attract my attention is that there is a little restaurant that becomes a club and a restaurant at weekends, called Tito's. ""I remember the bouncers and the people in the queue, the people having a cigarette. Every single one of them - they were like statues."" PC Marques continued: ""I remember grabbing my baton with my right hand and I racked (extended) it. ""I took a deep breath and I just charged the first one (attacker). ""As I got near him I swung at him with everything I had as hard as I could, straight through his head, trying to go for like a knock-out blow."" He heard the attacker ""yelp in pain"". PC Marques, who was stabbed numerous times, had major injuries to his head, left hand and left leg. He has recovered his sight after being wounded just above the right eye. Discussing that horrific injury, PC Marques said: ""He'd hit me so hard that my right eye went lights out straight away. I just went blind."" He believes the fight, in which he was set upon by all three attackers, lasted for up to 90 seconds. ""The second one and the third one, I was basically fighting left to right,"" he said, ""because I only had one eye so I'm moving left to right, left to right."" At that stage, the first attacker stabbed him in the leg. ""I'm thinking, 's***, there's a knife in my leg while I'm fighting the second one and the third one',"" he said. After he had been stabbed in the hand he remembered little except ""swinging (my baton) all over the place"". Regarding his injuries, PC Marques said he ""didn't realise how badly I was hurt"". ""The adrenaline,"" he added, ""the fighting, all of that, I could feel what they were doing to me but I couldn't feel it at the same time. ""I could just feel that I'd been cut and hurt."" As his colleague sent a message saying ""officer down"", PC Marques told him: ""Go get 'em, you've got to go get 'em."" PC Marques sat down and then lay on the ground. As other officers rallied around he struggled to remain conscious. He said: ""That black cloud starts to come to your vision and starts closing in and closing in and I pretty much knew time was up."" As he prepared to die, he asked a colleague to pass on his last messages to his parents, partner and the rest of his family. ""That was it,"" he said. ""Time was up. It's hard to explain what you kind of think and feel at the time."" After waking up in hospital, he says he felt a mixture of relief, shock and surprise. All three attackers were shot dead by police. PC Marques, who now takes around 25 pills a day, was discharged from hospital on Friday following a number of operations. He has lost feeling in the right side of his head where nerves were severed, cannot walk unaided and struggles to grip with his left hand. ""Hopefully with the right help and the right care, I'll get my legs back - that will be a great feeling. I am looking forward to getting my legs back definitely,"" he said. PC Marques says that being a hero was the ""last thing I was thinking about"". ""All I was trying to do was keep people alive,"" he said. ""That was my job, keep people alive. And that's what I did, that's what I tried to do."" He has paid tribute to the colleagues who helped him after the attack and the medical staff who have looked after him since then. Asked whether he would return to his job, he said his family would rather he did not go back to that role. ""You've done enough,"" they told him."

But it was unclear whether the upturn was driven by strengthening demand, thanks to higher employment and low mortgage costs, or if the shortage of homes on the market was a more important factor. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, warned the monthly figures could be volatile and that an emerging squeeze on household incomes did appear ""to be exerting a drag on housing market activity in recent months"". He added: ""Given the ongoing uncertainties around the UK's future trading arrangements, the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain, and housing market trends will depend crucially on developments in the wider economy. ""Nevertheless, in our view, household spending is likely to slow in the quarters ahead, along with the wider economy, as rising inflation squeezes household budgets. ""This, together with ongoing housing affordability pressures in key parts of the country, is likely to exert a drag on housing market activity and house price growth in the quarters ahead. ""However, the subdued level of building activity and the shortage of properties on the market are likely to provide support for prices."" The figures also showed a shift in house price trends, with growth in the south of England slowing to similar levels seen in the rest of the country. Annual house price growth in London, at 1.2%, was the weakest in the capital since 2012. The Nationwide figures come after the latest data from the British Bankers' Association showed the number of mortgage approvals was continuing to fall."
2017-06-28,"Women expecting to retire this year will on average be £6,400 a year worse off than men - with the gap £1,000 bigger than last year - according to new research.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170628210910/http://news.sky.com/story/retirement-income-gender-gap-widens-to-1636400-a-year-10929524,"The study from Prudential said the gender gap appears to reflect the fact that many women had taken career breaks and changed working patterns after having children. Women retiring this year can expect an average annual retirement income of £14,300 - that's the second highest level on record but lower than the £14,500 level in 2016. But the level for men rose for the fifth year in a row to £20,700 - £900 higher than last year. That is 45% higher than women's average income, the widest gender gap for three years. Kirsty Anderson, a retirement income expert at Prudential, said: ""The gender gap in retirement incomes continues to grow, probably reflecting the fact that many women will enter retirement having taken career breaks and changed their working patterns to look after dependants. ""Unfortunately, as a result, many women will end up with smaller pension pots and some are also likely to receive a reduced state pension. ""However, with a greater number of women staying in the workforce for longer these days, and employers increasingly offering more flexible working patterns, the outlook looks more positive for women's retirement incomes in the future."" Meanwhile, a separate study from Scottish Widows has warned that 70% of 22 to 29-year-olds are not putting away enough money to achieve their desired retirement income. The report says four in five young workers are now putting something away into their pension pots, with participation boosted by auto enrolment in workplace schemes. But average contributions - including money put in by employers - are just £184 a month, only enough to help produce an annual retirement income, including state pension, of £15,200. That falls well short of a desired income of £23,000. Catherine Stewart, retirement expert at Scottish Widows, said: ""Auto-enrolment may well be lulling people into a false sense of security that they are putting away enough for a comfortable retirement. ""For many, that is simply not the case, particularly given retirement is looking more expensive than ever."""

The bank said the deal would enable it ""to thrive as a stand-alone entity, with values and ethics and strong customer services continuing at the heart of its business"". The announcement confirmed an exclusive report on Sky News that revealed key details of the rescue deal - its second since 2013 when the hedge funds took control of the lender following the bank's near collapse under Co-op Group ownership. The agreement will see the consortium of Wall St financiers essentially put up around £700m of new money to shore up the bank's balance sheet and meet the capital requirements of regulators. The refinancing will take place partly through the sale of new shares but mostly via a so-called debt for equity swap. A major sticking point in the negotiations had been tensions over the division of the £10bn pension scheme shared by the Co-op Group and Bank, and the ongoing relationship agreement between them. It was confirmed by the bank that it had agreed to separate itself from the scheme, leaving the lender solely responsible for its employees' retirement savings. Under the deal, the Co-op Group's stake in the bank would fall from its current 20% level to 1% in the new holding company. Bank chairman, Dennis Holt, said: ""The board is pleased to confirm this proposal for a recapitalisation which will mean that the Co-operative Bank can continue as a viable stand-alone entity, with values and ethics at its heart. ""It is a great outcome for our customers. Our investors share our commitment to building our distinctive ethical franchise and see strong future growth potential for The Co-operative Bank."" The Co-op Group said it ""welcomed"" the deal, while a spokesman for the Prudential Regulation Authority said: ""The PRA has accepted the Co-operative Bank's plan to build greater financial resilience. ""Supervisors will remain closely engaged with the bank while the actions announced today are taken forward."""

Having declared last week that ""now is not yet the time"" to raise borrowing costs, he outlined in Portugal the conditions under which he could support an increase - stressing there could only be limited tolerance to above-target inflation. His comments are in sharp focus as they follow a shock split vote on the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) earlier this month. It showed that outgoing MPC member Kristin Forbes was joined by Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders in support of a rise in rates, from their record low 0.25%, to help tackle rising inflation. Such a move would spark an increase in mortgage repayment costs for those not on fixed rate deals. :: Forbes: Low interest rates no longer justified There was further surprise last week when the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, indicated he was on track to support a rise later this year. Ahead of this month's MPC vote, financial markets were forecasting no increase until 2019 at the earliest. Mr Carney said on Wednesday: ""Some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing the MPC continues to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional. ""The extent to which the trade-off moves in that direction will depend on the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand including business investment, whether wages and unit labour costs begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to both tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. ""These are some of the issues that the MPC will debate in the coming months."" Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""Sterling leapt above $1.29 to its strongest in three weeks after a surprising intervention from Bank of England governor Mark Carney, while continued dollar softness offered further support. :: LSE professor joining Bank's MPC ""The merest hint of removing some accommodation lifted cable past $1.2970 and the pound is now well clear of the sub-$1.26 level it traded at a week before."" He added: ""It's the clearest signal yet that the Bank is minded to tighten. ""There is a sense the MPC may wish to 'correct' its rate cut last summer in light of a surprisingly resilient UK economy and rising inflation, which is accelerating quicker than the Bank expected."" Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to EY Item Club, does not expect to see a rate rise this year. ""For the time being, the governor still looks to be in wait-and-see mode,"" he said. The MPC's next meeting is held in August."

The English author, who grew up in Berkshire, wrote 150 books in total, with an additional 25 books about Paddington, who then came to life in a well-loved television series. Today is a very sad day. Michael Bond CBE will be missed by many. pic.twitter.com/ZoCb5sU2V9 The official Paddington Twitter account posted a tribute to the late author, which was also retweeted by the official London Paddington Twitter page. Mr Bond's first book, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958 about the marmalade-loving bear from Peru. HarperCollins chief executive Charlie Redmayne said: ""Michael Bond was one of the great children's writers. ""At HarperCollins we are immensely fortunate to have published him and to have known him. ""He was a wonderful man and leaves behind one of the great literary legacies of our time."" So sorry to hear that Michael Bond has departed. He was as kindly, dignified, charming & lovable as the immortal Paddington Bear he gave us The adventures of Paddington, who became a classic character in children's literature, came to the big screen in 2014, with a sequel scheduled to hit cinemas this year. Ann-Janine Murtagh, HarperCollins executive publisher of children's books, told Sky News: ""Michael Bond and his creation Paddington bear had so many things in common - a big heart, an infectious enthusiasm for life and a twinkle in the eye. ""Michael would have taken delight in everything that has gone on around Paddington because people loved Paddington, young and old."" Hugh Bonneville, who plays Mr Brown in the recent film adaptation of Paddington and its forthcoming sequel, said in a statement: ""It seems particularly poignant that we should learn of dear Michael Bond's death on the last day of shooting our second film about his unique, loveable creation. ""In Paddington, Michael created a character whose enthusiasm and optimism has given pleasure to millions across the generations. ""Michael will be greatly missed by his legions of fans and especially by his wife Sue, his family and of course by his beloved guinea pigs. He leaves a special legacy: long live the bear from darkest Peru."" Mr Bond was awarded an OBE for services to children's literature in 1997, followed by a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2015."
2017-06-28,The Government has defeated a Labour bid to end the cap on public sector pay in the first parliamentary test of the Tory-DUP deal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170628210910/http://news.sky.com/story/government-defeats-labours-bid-to-end-public-sector-pay-freeze-10930469,"Labour had attempted to push through an amendment to the Queen's Speech calling on ministers to recruit more police officers and firefighters and to end the 1% limit on annual pay rises for public sector workers. But their efforts were defeated in the House of Commons, with 323 MPs opposing the amendment versus 309 in favour. The result gave the Government a majority of 14. Wednesday night's vote was the first test of the minority Conservative Government's ""confidence and supply"" agreement with the DUP's 10 MPs. The amendment was backed by all opposition parties, while all DUP MPs voted with the Government against the Labour revision. The full Labour amendment expressed ""regret"" last week's Queen's Speech failed to end cuts to the police and fire service, along with the demands on boosting the number of emergency service workers and their pay. Responding to the result, Labour's Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities and local government secretary, told Sky News: ""We think it's time these public sector servants - nurses, teachers, police officers, council workers - that they get a pay rise. ""Clearly we weren't able to win the vote today because the DUP deal the Conservatives have done has seen them over the line."" He highlighted the Government's promise to spend £1bn extra in Northern Ireland as part of their agreement with the DUP, adding: ""It's ironic there's not going to be any austerity in Northern Ireland, but in England, Scotland and Wales we have to continue with this austerity and pain."" Tory MP John Penrose said: ""After seven years of everyone having to tighten their belts - private sector as well as public sector let's not forget - everybody is starting to feel the pinch."" The Weston-super-Mare MP admitted ""people want to see an opportunity to change this"" but insisted amending the Queen's Speech could have led the Government to fall - just weeks after voters made the Tories the largest party. He added: ""If you're going to try and add extra money to any part of the public sector you've got to say where you're going to get it from."" The vote followed confusion over the future of public sector pay after Downing Street earlier signalled it could lift the 1% cap. A senior Number 10 source said the Prime Minister had ""heard the message"" of the General Election and the Government understood ""people are weary"" of austerity measures. But, hours later, Downing Street insisted there had been no change to the Government's policy. Setting out the Government's legislative agenda for the next two years, the Queen's Speech was dominated by the Brexit process while a number of the Tories' election manifesto pledges were ditched following their failure to win a majority. Labour are likely to try and force other amendments to the Queen's Speech on Thursday."

It comes a week after Tesco outlined plans to shed 1,100 jobs as it closes a call centre in Cardiff - and said the retail sector was ""facing unprecedented challenges"". Chief executive Dave Lewis has been seeking to turn around the fortunes of the business since taking over in 2014 amid falling sales and profits. Earlier this month, the supermarket reported its best quarterly sales growth since 2010 despite tough market conditions, helped by efforts to hold back inflation pressures to keep prices low for customers. In the latest jobs announcement, the group said it was making changes to simplify its organisation and reduce duplication and cost as well as allowing it to ""invest in serving shoppers better"". Tesco said: ""This is a significant next step to continue the turnaround of the business. ""We have made good progress so far in our turnaround but we have more to do. ""We will work with colleagues to support them as we go through this important transition."" Pauline Foulkes, national officer at shopworkers' union Usdaw, said: ""Tesco's head office staff are understandably very concerned that the company is proposing further large-scale job losses.""

Kevin Hurley, a former senior investigator with City of London police, said the MP had got it wrong and was fuelling conspiracy theories. Mr Hurley, who led a team of UK police officers to help identify British victims of the 9/11 attacks, said: ""I like David Lammy, he is a very good constituency MP and he cares about people. ""But in this case he's called it wrong and by what he's doing, he's actually causing some people to take up that call that it's been covered up. ""The reality is that having investigated many, many fires in the past, the police will probably never know how many people were in that building. ""There is no question that the very top floors of the building are pretty well burnt out. ""And even though they're putting in specialist search teams to have a look, they'll be lucky to find the odd bone fragment and that's about all."" Scotland Yard commanders estimate the death toll in Grenfell tower is 79, but acknowledge that number may rise. However, there are many local residents who believe the figure is much higher and that police are suppressing the truth to help prevent anger within the community. In recent media interviews, David Lammy, who lost a friend in the tragedy, expressed sympathy for that viewpoint. In further social media posts on Tuesday, he said: ""The truth is that the authorities have lost the trust of the community. Making an effort to work out how many people were in Grenfell would be a good first step. ""The community was let down over Grenfell and they feel let down again by the lack of info on numbers."" Two weeks on from the fire, the community around the burnt out tower block is one which still feels utterly traumatised by the tragedy. Everywhere, people can be seen pausing to stare at Grenfell, or to read the many appeals for the missing, posted on walls, bus stops and phone boxes. Among them are other posters claiming the number of dead is at least 150. Emmanuel Matomby, stopping to pay his respects at one of the makeshift shrines, said: ""I can see from the perspective of the police, them not wanting to release the number straight away because that's going to cause outrage. ""But at the same time, the families don't know what on earth is going on. They want to bring an end to the doubt. ""So when you look at how big that building is, there's loads of people living on the top floors. I don't want to say the number, but it's got to be in three figures."" The singer Lily Allen was the first high-profile figure to give voice to claims the authorities were not being honest about the death toll. The comments by David Lammy will only compound the suspicions many around Grenfell have. Tiago Alves fled Grenfell tower with his family. They are now being housed in a local hotel, until the council can find them something permanent. ""I genuinely think that the death toll is higher,"" he said. ""A lot of people are saying that it might be a cover-up. I'm not sure that that's the case, but there are a lot of people who are not necessarily registered and we're not sure if they're missing. ""Hopefully within the next couple of weeks, the death toll will be confirmed."" Prince Charles paid a private visit to the local sports centre on Tuesday, which is now an emergency relief hub. For those made homeless, their most pressing concern is getting the help they need to rebuild their lives. But for others, suspicions they are not being told the truth are not going away."

Duckenfield has been charged with the manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 of the 96 Liverpool FC fans who died at the FA Cup semi-final. The CPS was unable to charge him for the manslaughter of the 96th victim, Anthony Bland, because he died almost four years after the disaster. Bettison is accused of four counts of misconduct in public office. These charges relate to telling alleged lies about his involvement in the aftermath of Hillsborough and the culpability of fans, the Crown Prosecution Service said. :: LIVE: Ex-officers among Hillsborough suspects Denton, Foster and Metcalf are charged with doing acts with intent to pervert the course of justice relating to material changes made to witness statements.

He said: ""Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him."" Sky's Mike McCarthy was at Hillsborough during the 1989 disaster and was with victims' families when they were told the news that charges would be brought. He said: ""This is without doubt a critical decision, a crucial decision in their long campaign. It isn't, of course, the end of the road. Prosecutions are one thing, what the families will be looking for are successful prosecutions."" ""In a way we're pressing the reset button. We're going back 28 years to that day - 15 April 1989 - and we're starting afresh as far as families are concerned."" Announcing the charges, Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""The suspects referred to the CPS included individuals and organisations. Following these thorough investigations and our careful review of the evidence in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge six individuals with criminal offences."" The defendants, other than Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court in August. Before prosecuting Duckenfield, the CPS must apply to remove a stay imposed after a 1999 private prosecution when he was prosecuted for two counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. Once successfully lifted, Duckenfield's case can then proceed on a voluntary bill of indictment. A spokesman for Sheffield Wednesday said the club had no comment to make."

Sir Michael had said Russia would be looking at Britain's new vessel, HMS Queen Elizabeth, with a ""little bit of envy"". However, spokesman Igor Konashenkov dismissed the British aircraft carrier as ""just a convenient oversized target at sea"", and claimed Sir Michael's remarks proved he has a ""clear lack of naval knowledge"". The Russian official added: ""It is in the interests of the British Royal Navy not to show off the 'beauty' of its aircraft carrier on the high seas any closer than a few hundred miles to its Russian 'distant relative'."" Although the Admiral Kuznetsov dates back to the Soviet era, Moscow says its aircraft carrier can defend itself with an array of offensive and defensive weapons - unlike the British vessel which relies on escort ships for protection. HMS Queen Elizabeth, which set out on its maiden voyage from its dock in Scotland on Monday, cost £3bn to build. Meanwhile, the Admiral Kuznetsov is set to undergo a costly refurbishment at a port in the northern city of Murmansk.

2017-06-29,A woman has been found guilty of pretending to be a man to trick her female friend into having sex.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170629214609/http://news.sky.com/story/gayle-newland-found-guilty-of-pretending-to-be-a-man-to-trick-female-friend-into-sex-10931724,"A court heard how 27-year-old Gayle Newland, of Willaston, Cheshire, created an online persona to satisfy her sexual urges. Newland was found guilty of committing sexual assault using a prosthetic penis without the victim's consent during a retrial at Manchester Crown Court. In November 2015 she was jailed for eight years after she was convicted of the same offence at Chester Crown Court but the conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal last December. A retrial was ordered after it was found that the trial judge's summing up of the case was not fair and balanced. Newland persuaded the victim to wear a blindfold at all times when they met and she only realised she was having sex with her when she finally took it off. The defendant claimed the woman was fully aware she was pretending to be Kye Fortune - a Facebook profile she created at the age of 15 in which she used an American man's photographs and videos as they engaged in role play while struggling with their sexuality. Newland denied that a blindfold had been used as they had sex on about 10 occasions at the victim's flat in Chester in 2013. She also told the court she did not strap bandages to her chest or wear a swimsuit and a woollen hat to hide her appearance. The court heard Newland spent ""hundreds"" of hours talking on the telephone to her friend as Kye and had spent more than 100 hours in each other's company. The complainant said these encounters included her wearing a blindfold at all times together - including watching television and even on a car journey. Prosecutor Simon Medland QC told the jury: ""This manipulative, deceitful and very crafty young woman went to such astonishing lengths to control the complainant's life and make her do the things the defendant wanted her to do."" The verdicts can be reported after reporting restrictions imposed at the start of the retrial were lifted. Newland was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault and cleared of a fourth count. She cried in the dock, shook her head and said: ""I can't go back to jail."" The Recorder of Manchester, Judge David Stockdale QC, granted Newland bail ahead of sentencing on 20 July but he told her the ""overwhelming likelihood"" was that she would receive ""a significant immediate custodial sentence""."

The retired Court of Appeal judge has held many high-profile roles over a career spanning five decades Born in December 1946 and educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, he was called to the bar in 1969. Sir Martin began his legal career specialising in commercial contracts and went on to be appointed Queen's Counsel in 1986. He sat as a Deputy High Court judge before he was appointed to the High Court in October 1995. The father-of-four had served in the Commercial Court of the High Court before he joined the Court of Appeal in April 2005. There, he was an adviser to two Lord Chancellors: Lord Falconer and Jack Straw. Sir Martin has handled prominent cases in the past - one of which saw him rule on a challenge brought by the family of Mark Duggan over police procedures following fatal shootings by officers. He also ruled on the case of a council looking to rehouse a mother-of-five 50 miles away from her current property because a cap on benefits had made her London flat unaffordable. Although Sir Martin allowed Westminster City Council to rehouse Titina Nzolameso near Milton Keynes, his decision was later overturned by the Supreme Court. He most recently held the title of Lord Justice of Appeal, retiring last December. The Prime Minister has said a full judge-led inquiry is needed to ensure the blaze at the 24-storey block in west London, which killed at least 80 people, is ""properly investigated"". Theresa May has also insisted that residents will be given a say over the direction of the investigation."

Resham Khan, who was celebrating her 21st birthday, and her cousin Jameel Muhktar, 37, tried to drive away, but the suspect ran after them and the car crashed into a fence. The victims were helped by members of the public after the attack, and were driven to a nearby hospital. Business management student Miss Khan, who had recently returned from an exchange year in Cyprus, said on her Twitter page: ""The pain was excruciating I was struggling to close the window. My cousin struggled to get us away. I saw my clothes burn away in front of me."" Police have released a photo of 24-year-old John Tomlin, who they want to speak to in connection with the attack.

I am so confident my face and body will be back. Tbh can't wait to recover and have my hair and make up done Miss Khan and Mr Mukhtar suffered severe burns to their face and body in the attack. A fundraising page has been set up by a friend of Miss Khan to contribute towards her rehabilitation and has almost reached its target of £30,000. Detective Superintendent Neil Matthews said: ""I would like to reassure the public that our continued focus remains on finding the person responsible for this horrendous act of violence. ""We will continue to progress these enquiries as quickly as humanly possible and fully understand concerns that they should be brought to justice quickly.""

The thoroughbred breeding stables are named after the Godolphin Arabian, first bred in 1724, which takes the name of its best known owner Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin. Godolphin Cross Community Association chairman Richard McKie described the donation as a ""fairy tale"". He told CornwallLive: ""These kinds of things don't normally happen. It's a fairy tale really. It's not often a sheikh steps in to help a Cornish village."" Mr McKie said the villagers' offer on the chapel had been verbally accepted.

Without a deal by 4pm, the country faces the prospect of direct rule from Westminster for the first time in a decade. It would be the fourth time that a deadline has been missed, but the DUP's Edwin Poots has insisted talks will continue this evening and into the weekend if necessary. ""At this stage we aren't close to an agreement, there is considerable work to be done and we believe the ball is in the court of Sinn Fein in the main in dealing with a series of outstanding issues,"" he said. Minutes earlier, Sinn Fein had warned the DUP that it is ""make up your mind time"" - with Conor Murphy claiming ""limited progress"" has been made in bridging the gaps between the two parties. The two parties, whose agreement is a pre-requisite of the formation of a new administration, have been struggling to overcome differences on the Irish language. Sinn Fein is demanding a stand-alone Irish Language Act, bringing Irish onto a par with English in the region. But the DUP had proposed a hybrid act, accommodating the Irish language and those who speak in Ulster-Scots. Language is considered a sensitive issue of cultural identity, much like the flying of flags in Northern Ireland. Earlier, Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire had claimed ""significant progress"" had been made in the talks. He had insisted that a deal to restore devolution was both ""possible and achievable"". Without an agreement in force, Mr Brokenshire will have to make a statement to MPs in Westminster on Monday to set out what happens next. The devolved government collapsed in January when Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness resigned as Deputy First Minister. DUP leader Arlene Foster had refused to stand aside as First Minister during an inquiry into a botched renewable energy scheme. Sinn Fein's vote surged in the subsequent Assembly election but parties failed to share power within the six-week timeframe. Instead of calling another election, Mr Brokenshire extended the deadline at Stormont."

2017-06-29,Scientists have discovered that honeybees in the UK suffer from a bad diet and ill-health.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170629214609/http://news.sky.com/story/honeybees-in-the-uk-have-a-bad-diet-10931188,"The £2.7m study, which analysed 50-60 hectares (120-150 acres) in the UK, Hungary and Germany, found bees were vulnerable to potentially harmful nicotine-based pesticides called neonicotinoids. German honeybees were found to be healthier than those in the UK and Hungary. The research suggested that feeding on treated crops reduced the bees' ability to sustain themselves through winter and survive until spring. Death rates among the honeybees were highest when they gathered nectar and pollen from oil seed rape treated with neonicotinoids. Honeybees in Germany appeared to be unaffected by the chemicals, though scientists could not say for certain why this was. In both the UK and Hungary, honeybees have a severely restricted diet, largely due to the loss of wild flowers from farmland. Professor Richard Pywell, a leading member of the UK team from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), said: ""Variation among countries was found and this suggests that the effects of neonicotinoids are influenced by other factors, such as what the bees are feeding on in the landscape, and disease."" Neonicotinoids are used on more than 140 different types of crop, and are also used to feed legumes, potatoes, fruits, rice, and vegetables. Friends of the Earth's nature campaigner Sandra Bell said: ""The UK Government must stop asking for yet more evidence and back tough action on these dangerous chemicals to protect our precious pollinators."" The trial, reported in the journal Science, was mostly funded by two leading manufacturers of neonicotinoids, Bayer and Syngenta. Bayer said: ""The CEH did not find consistent effects across Germany, Hungary and the UK on key indicators of honeybee health such as colony strength, forager morality, overwintering success of the colonies, behaviour or disease susceptibility in honeybees."""

2017-06-29,Industry bosses from the Star Wars and Bond franchises have warned the UK film industry is facing a serious diversity issue.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170629214609/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-film-industry-suffering-from-diversity-pandemic-10930953,"Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli are part of a group of industry leaders backing a government action plan to tackle the problem. This comes after an industry review commissioned by the British Film Industry found there is a ""pandemic lack of inclusion"" in the business. The paper published by the Work Foundation showed that just 12% of the film workforce are from less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds. Of those, 5% have a disability and just 3% are from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background. Women make up 40% of the workforce and earn on average £3,000 less than their male counterparts. According to the review, this is contributing to a serious skills shortage, which requires 10,000 people to enter the industry over the next five years to maintain the UK's position in the global market. ""Learners genuinely lack an awareness that there are opportunities for them in the screen industries,"" said Work Foundation's associate consultant Heather Carey. ""We found, having looked at demand and supply, that the progression into work is not an easy one. There is a culture of nepotism, the majority of employers recruit through word of mouth, and that creates real barriers for people who don't know people,"" she added. Carey says the exclusion of young workers from less advantaged socio-economic background is mostly due to unpaid work experience. ""Then there is real challenge of unpaid work experience, no wonder that acts as an obstacle, particularly for those without financial means,"" she said. ""Those obstacles are more pronounced for minority groups, but they face additional barriers. Through our process of consultation we found examples of discrimination in the workplace,"" Carey added. ""When we try to get below the surface there are huge obstacles and those obstacles are creating a pandemic lack of inclusion in this industry."" This comes as the Academy for Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who vote for the Oscars, is inviting 774 new members to join its ranks in a drive for diversity. Riz Ahmed, Naomie Harris and Warwick Davis are among the actors invited to become film academy members. The academy announced that 39% of the new class are women and a third non-white, meaning the academy'smembers are now 13% people of colour, up from 8% two years ago. In the UK, the BFI is using a £20m boost from the National Lottery to launch a 10-point action plan which includes the creation of a reliable online career information service, an accreditation system to guarantee employer confidenceand a mentoring service. It will also include new apprenticeship standards, a service to forecast industry needs and a bursary programme to ensure diverse participation."
2017-06-29,The public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire is set to be a wide-ranging investigation.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170629214609/http://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-fire-inquiry-six-questions-victims-want-answered-10931151,"Not only did the tragedy claim at least 80 lives, but it has revealed what one fire safety expert described as the worst ever failure in the history of British construction. As the newly appointed chairman begins to compile his terms of reference, here are six questions people want answered. 1. Why did a small fire in a fridge spread so quickly and why were so many people not able to escape?  A thorough understanding of forensic details on how the fire spread, and of the catastrophic failure of the measures in place to keep people safe, are the most pressing issues. 2. How could this happen in a building refurbished in 2016, at a cost of £10m and approved and signed off by one of London's wealthiest boroughs?  Every aspect of the building will be examined, from its original design to subsequent alterations and the latest refurbishment. 3. What documentary evidence can be found to show who was responsible for crucial aspects of the building's design and construction, and whether they did they did their jobs properly?  Chancellor Philip Hammond controversially claimed that the combustible polyethylene cladding attached to the outside of the building is banned in the UK, but the inquiry will want to look at other issues too, including the polyisocyanurate insulation panels that released deadly hydrogen cyanide gas as they burned. 4. Where were building control officers and the Government's fire investigators and safety advisers while tower blocks across the country were being covered in material that burns but was passed as fire safe?  Last year, the Government was assured by its advisers BRE Global that regulations were ""adequate"" to keep people safe. Now, the Prime Minister has said an investigation into the problem will need to look back decades. Failures in building control are potentially the most far-reaching issues to tackle. 5. Who is responsible?  As high-rise buildings across the country are stripped of their cladding following Government-ordered emergency tests, the construction industry - and the officials who regulate, advise and test its products - are all under pressure. 6. When will it end?  The Government has said it wants some answers soon, and it is thought an interim report could come out this summer. But the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war shows how public inquiries can get bogged down when those who face criticism are given the opportunity to respond before publication. With the UK construction industry worth more than £100bn a year and supporting around three million jobs - and the likelihood that Government advisers and departmental decisions will come under scrutiny - the emotional, financial and political stakes could not be higher."

There needs to be a separate focus on social housing and systemic failures and I don't know if that is coming out of this."" Amanda Fernandez, who lost her 12-year-old cousin in the fire, said she did not have confidence in the investigation.

""I'm well aware the residents and the local people want a much broader investigation and I can fully understand why they would want that. ""Whether my inquiry is the right way in which to achieve that I'm more doubtful.

At least 80 people were killed in the devastating blaze at a west London tower block earlier this month.

The surprise announcement was met with both concern and celebration, with some saying the Commons had finally entered the 21st century, but others joking: what next? Mr Bercow addressed the issue after Liberal Democrat Tom Brake asked a question in the Commons on Wednesday without wearing a tie. ""It seems to me that as long as a member arrives in the House in what might be thought to be business-like attire, the question of whether that member is wearing a tie is not absolutely front and centre stage,"" the Speaker said. ""Do I think it's essential that a member wears a tie? No."" Mr Bercow said: ""I think there has always been some discretion for the chair to decide what is seemly and proper, and members shouldn't behave in a way that is disrespectful of their colleagues or of the institution."" He added that female MPs are also free to wear ties, or not, as they choose. In the past, male lawmakers have occasionally been reprimanded for going tie-less. But Mr Bercow has been looking to modernise proceedings in the Commons. Earlier this year, he dropped the requirement for clerks to wear wigs. The new move was also applied to male political reporters, who have been refused entry when not wearing ties in the past, to mixed response. ""John Bercow has crossed a line by dropping the requirement for men to wear ties in the Commons. What's next? MPs in flip-flops and shorts?"" The Telegraph newspaper's Christopher Hope joked on Twitter. John Bercow has crossed a line by dropping the requirement for men to wear ties in the Commons. What's next? MPs in flip flops and shorts? The Sun's Matt Dathan praised Parliament for ""finally moving out of the 19th century"". The ""Rules of behaviour and courtesies in the House"" leaflet issued by the Speaker states that, while there is no exact dress code, the custom has been that men are expected to wear a jacket and tie. The Erskine May parliamentary practice guide says it remains a custom for male MPs to wear a jacket and tie ""but the Speaker has not enforced the practice in all circumstances""."

The company took the decision despite tough trading conditions for many retailers as consumers tighten their belts. Shoppers are generally being more cautious as many prices rise - a consequence of imports being made more expensive through a weaker pound since the EU referendum. :: Why not everything is doom and gloom in retail The knock-on effect is being exacerbated by wage growth failing to keep pace with those growing costs - prompting a number of major retailers to confirm a return to choppy times.

""We are determined to combine the best of Bunnings Warehouse with what UK consumers want. The success of the pilots still remains a precursor to additional investment."" He said the firm had seen ""very little inflation"" in its own prices after the pound regained some ground from the lows seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote."
2017-06-29,The Government has been forced to cover the cost of abortions for women travelling to England from Northern Ireland to avoid an embarrassing defeat in Parliament.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170629214609/http://news.sky.com/story/government-to-fund-abortions-for-northern-ireland-women-in-england-10931223,"The Labour MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy tabled an amendment to the Queen's Speech calling for all Northern Irish women to be able to ""access all medical services including abortion…without charge."" Ms Creasy claimed at least 40 Conservative MPs were prepared to support the measure, overpowering the slim majority held by the Government after agreeing a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. It is the DUP that has blocked legal abortions from being performed in Northern Ireland - as matters of health are devolved to Stormont. :: Summing up the Prime Minister's slim majority When the scale of the support became clear, the Minister For Women and Equalities Justine Greening wrote a letter to MPs explaining the new position. ""At present women from Northern Ireland are asked for payment, and from now on it is our proposal that this will no longer happen. ""This is clearly a sensitive issue and one which has direct implications for equality in treatment of women from Northern Ireland. ""Following discussions with the Department of Health, we will ensure these payments will be funded through the Government Equalities Office with additional funding. This will mean no English health service user is disadvantaged as a result of this change,"" she said. The climb down shows how vulnerable the Government is to cross party amendments with broad-based support, even on such important moments in the parliamentary calendar as the Queen's Speech. Abortion is banned in Northern Ireland unless the woman's life is at risk or her mental or physical health face permanent and serious risk. Charities have welcomed the Government's move, with some hailing it as a ""landmark moment"". ""We are absolutely delighted that the Government has committed to funding abortion care for women who travel from Northern Ireland to England,"" said a spokeswoman from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. ""This is a landmark moment: for years the women of Northern Ireland, despite being UK citizens and taxpayers, have not been entitled to NHS-funded treatment."""
2017-06-29,A woman has been charged with manslaughter after she allegedly shot her boyfriend dead when a YouTube stunt apparently went wrong.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170629214609/http://news.sky.com/story/woman-shot-boyfriend-when-youtube-stunt-went-wrong-10930688,"Monalisa Perez told police she wanted to film herself shooting a bullet into a book Pedro Ruiz was holding against his chest. Mr Ruiz, 22, thought the book would stop the bullet, CBS affiliate WSPA reported. Perez, a pregnant 20-year-old, said she fired the .50-calibre handgun from about a foot (30cm) away. Mr Ruiz, who has a child with Perez, died from a gunshot wound to the chest, authorities in Halstad, Minnesota, said. The incident happened at about 6.30pm on Monday. An air ambulance was called to the scene on US Highway 75 but Mr Ruiz was pronounced dead. When police examined the scene they found two GoPro cameras had been set up - one on the back of a car and one on a ladder. The victim's aunt, Claudia Ruiz, told WDAY-TV the couple often carried out pranks and put them on the amateur video channel. She told Valley News Live: ""They were in love. They loved each other. It was just a prank gone wrong. It shouldn't of happened like this. ""He had told me about an idea. I said, don't do it, don't do it. Why are you going to use a gun? Why? Because, we want more viewers."" Perez, who faces second degree manslaughter and reckless discharge of a firearm charges, was granted a public defence lawyer and released on $7,000 bail. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail."
2017-06-29,"Four in five food bank users have skipped meals and go hungry several times a year, new research says.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170629214609/http://news.sky.com/story/food-bank-users-skipping-meals-and-going-hungry-study-finds-10931077,"Research conducted by Oxford University has found price rises and insecure incomes are the biggest reasons people turn to food banks for essential supplies. Over half of households turning to food banks include a disabled person, while one in three include someone with a mental health condition. Half the people questioned said they also struggle to pay for toiletries and heating. Julian Johnson, 37, who has been using a food bank in Coventry for 18 months after losing his delivery job six years ago, told Sky News he is struggling to meet repayments on mounting credit card debts, leaving very little to live on. ""Some days I do go hungry,"" he said. ""I do walk the streets sometimes to find the odd bit of change that people have dropped. I scrounge. ""It's very difficult. Some nights I have early nights because of this hunger problem."" David McAuley, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, which commissioned the latest research, said: ""Last year, Trussell Trust food bank volunteers provided 1.2 million emergency food supplies to people in crisis. ""This pioneering research confirms to us what those volunteers have been telling us. ""Every day they are meeting people trying to cope with low, insecure incomes and rising prices that mean even the smallest unexpected expense can leave them destitute and hungry, be that an unexpected bill, bereavement or the loss of income caused by benefit delay. ""Particularly concerning are the very high numbers of disabled people or people with mental health problems needing food banks. ""These findings reaffirm how vital the work of food banks and generosity of donors is, but are also a clear challenge to the new Government to do more to stop people ending up in crisis in the first place."" A Government spokesman said: ""We're helping millions of households meet the everyday cost of living and keep more of what they earn while also spending over £90bn a year in extra support for those who need it. ""Employment is the best route out of poverty and, with record numbers of people - including disabled people - now in work, we've made great progress. ""But we want to go even further to help ordinary families."""
2017-06-29,The acting chief of the French air force has been accused of using a fighter jet to commute home at weekends.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170629214609/http://news.sky.com/story/french-general-accused-of-using-fighter-jet-for-weekend-commutes-to-provence-10930793,"General Richard Reboul is alleged to have used an Alpha Jet at least 10 times over the last year, flying between his workplace in Bordeaux to his weekend property in Provence. Flying at its maximum speed of 620mph (1,000kmph), the jet would have been able to complete the 327-mile trip (600km) in just half an hour. The commute would normally take around seven hours by train, six hours by car or an hour by conventional plane, followed by a 30-minute car ride. Using around 800l (176 gallons) of fuel per hour, French satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchaine estimated the fighter jet journeys could have cost the air force and French taxpayers tens of thousands of euros over the past year. The alleged misuse came to light after General Reboul switched to a small military transporter for his trip, along with a pilot and co-pilot, who are said to have dropped him off and returned to collect him on Monday morning, the Canard reported. France's new defence minister, Florence Parly, has ordered an investigation, saying there would be ""consequences"" if the alleged ""abuse of resources"" is confirmed. General Reboul stepped in as interim air force chief after his superior, General Serge Soulet, died in May. Alpha Jets are normally used for training purposes and light attack missions, and additionally perform in Patrouille de France, the country's aerobatic display team."

The announcement was welcomed by the Government amid fears that some companies are putting off decisions due to Brexit uncertainty. Rolls-Royce said it was investing over the next few years in new and existing facilities across the East Midlands. It is creating a new facility in Derby for testing large aero engines, resulting in up to 200 jobs, while plans to close a precision machining facility in the town have been scrapped, saving 150 jobs that had previously been at risk. The announcement is part of the global group's plans to double engine production and follows months of talks with unions. They have agreed workers can help train new staff who will be based in Germany and elsewhere, in return for a guarantee, covering 7,000 East Midlands-based employees, of no compulsory redundancies over the next five years. Eric Schulz, Rolls-Royce president for civil aerospace, said: ""With this investment, we are creating the capacity and flexibility to deliver on our goals, while committing to sustain employment in the UK."" Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""This announcement underpins the critical role the UK plays within the global aerospace sector. ""I welcome the confidence the company is showing in the UK. ""This is just the investment our modern industrial strategy is looking to attract."" Unite national officer Ian Waddell said: ""There were real fears that future investment could go overseas, but thanks to the skills, capabilities and adaptability of Rolls-Royce's UK workforce, thousands of jobs have been secured."" Rolls-Royce has been undergoing major restructuring amid a string of profit warnings. The company employs 22,000 people in the UK. Earlier this year it reported its biggest ever annual loss, slumping into the red by £4.6bn for 2016 thanks to a huge accounting writedown caused by the collapse in the pound since the Brexit vote. Meanwhile it has agreed to pay out £671m to settle bribery and corruption probes in the UK, US and Brazil, including a record £497m penalty from Britain's Serious Fraud Office."
