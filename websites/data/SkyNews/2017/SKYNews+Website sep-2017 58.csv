She said her voice, name and image had been used without permission in a string of claims dating back 30 years. Basil added she has suffered ""sleep deprivation, nightmares and anxiety"" over the issue, court papers filed in LA and obtained by Deadline show. Lawyers for Basil, 73, said she was previously unaware 'Mickey' appeared in a 2008 South Park episode, which spoofs that year's US election result. In it, one of the characters, Randy, celebrates the Democrat's win, singing: ""Obama you so fine, you so fine you blow my mind, hey Obama, hey Obama."" Basil is also suing Disney, accusing the entertainment company of using her song to promote a line of clothing. ""Basil's exclusive right to publicity has been damaged by the coupling with Mickey Mouse and the Disney brand,"" the lawsuit said. None of the parties Basil is suing have commented."
2017-09-01,Former England captain Wayne Rooney has been charged with drink driving.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/wayne-rooney-arrested-for-drink-driving-11015598,"The Everton striker, 31, was stopped by police while driving a black VW Beetle along Altrincham Road in Wilmslow, Cheshire, at 2am on Friday. Rooney has been released on bail and is due to appear at Stockport Magistrates' Court on 18 September - the day after his former club Manchester United take on The Toffees at Old Trafford. A picture posted on Instagram just after 10pm on Thursday showed Rooney and cricketer Jack McIver at the Bubble Room bar in Alderley Edge. Mr McIver wrote: ""International Break #legend."" The post was deleted as reports of Rooney's arrest surfaced after 11am on Friday. The Liverpool-born player, whose wife Coleen is pregnant with their fourth child, retired from international football in August having captained the Three Lions since 2014. Rooney, of Collar House Drive, Prestbury, is England's all-time top scorer with 53 goals. He rejoined boyhood club Everton this summer after 13 years at Manchester United."
2017-09-01,"Dozens more British troops are to be sent to Iraq, the Defence Secretary has announced.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/more-british-troops-head-for-iraq-to-defeat-islamic-state-11015054,"Forty-four Royal Engineers will be sent to Al Asad airbase in Anbar province, western Iraq, Sir Michael Fallon has confirmed. The troops from 5 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 22 Engineer Regiment, in Tidworth will be in Iraq for six months to build infrastructure at the coalition camp. Their deployment will take the number of British personnel at the camp to more than 300 and the total in Iraq to around 600. The airbase is around 140 miles west of Baghdad and is home to troops from Iraq, the US, Denmark and the UK. UK troops are there to train Iraqi forces, as they try to remove the last Islamic State fighters from their country. IS once controlled around a third of Iraq but, having lost much of its territory in the past few months, it now controls barely 10%. Earlier this year, Iraqi forces retook the former IS stronghold of Mosul and last week, they retook the northern city of Tal Afar and surrounding region of Nineveh. Iraqi forces have also been steadily retaking the towns and cities of Anbar, which borders Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, but IS still controls parts of the border with Syria. Sir Michael said: ""We are stepping up our contribution to the fight against Daesh (IS) and fulfilling Britain's role as a key player in the global coalition. ""Daesh is being defeated. ""Iraqi forces, backed by coalition air strikes, have now liberated 70% of the territory Daesh held and the victims of its barbarism are being helped by our humanitarian support. ""These extra troops will help support operations to bring the defeat of Daesh a step closer."" The UK ended its combat role in Iraq in 2009, six years after the US-led invasion."
2017-09-01,Many people are reflecting on where they were when the news of Diana Princess of Wales's death was announced.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/princess-diana-the-royal-death-that-shocked-the-world-11013222,"For me it's easy. I was in bed at home and woke when the 'pager', which Sky News insisted I carry at all times, buzzed into life. Bleary eyed, I reached for it and read the code words I half expected ""Royal Down"". All broadcasters had for some time prepared themselves to respond to the Queen Mother dying. She seemed eternal but was then in her 97th year. Seconds later, my mother came into the room and told me what she had just seen on the television. The shock was intense. Diana was my age. Her life had seemed agonisingly complicated and public in the months preceding this jolt, but this development was beyond all fathom. As Sky's Commentator of National Events, it was not immediately clear what my role might be. After all, the marriage between Prince Charles and Diana had been over for some time and it didn't seem likely that a Royal Ceremonial Funeral would follow. My instinct (how wrong I was), leant towards a Spencer family funeral. The only part of this that arguably did transpire was that the Spencer's retained a strong lead in presence and style and, after 10 fraught days, Diana found her eternal rest on the island in the lake of her family home. Diana was a phenomenon and so, as frequently happens in Britain, events took hold of protocols and made them bend to a ferocious public expectation and utility. By the time I was sat in the studio at Osterley at 9am on the morning of the funeral - the audible apex to a gargantuan team effort by Sky - the United Kingdom had writhed through a heart attack of sorts. In the middle of this wounded lion's cage stood the courtiers at Buckingham Palace, who had zero precedent to draw on and must have had to fumble in search of the right solution. While this evolved, the newly elected and exceptionally popular Government had a strong influence, the media's views were everywhere and Diana's family must have fought for space. The Armed Forces were put on standby but, for what? Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Ross was the Queen's principal adviser on ceremonial matters. We had both served in the Scots Guards and I'm sure his training must have helped. His team, in what is called the Lord Chamberlain's Office, worked through the nations emotions to fix upon a ceremonial and an Order of Service. Any family that faces bereavement, especially a shock one, must recognise that there can be difficulties. I'm sure errors of approach must have been made by all sides, many might have been disappointed by stands taken or ideas posed but, in the end, the book of protocol produced a unique ceremony for a unique person. The template for Diana's funeral, at Westminster Abbey, was indeed that held for the ageing Queen Mother but marching servicemen were replaced by representatives of countless charities and great organisations, which this great icon of a mother had championed. And there in the centre, where in 1920 for the State Funeral of the Unknown Warrior the King Emperor, George V walked, were Diana's two boys. Men now, but boys then. And the impression upon crowd and world was intense. Ceremony and event are the servants of emotion, though sometimes they can tweak it. On 6 September 1997, as the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery and Welsh Guards Bearer Party stepped off from Kensington Palace, the global catharsis of mourning and healing began. In the seconds before going live to commentate the event, I thought much of the young girl whose father had been a school friend of my father's in the war. The young woman who had been friend to so many I knew. It was a grim duty, but to be a part of what was actually a striking and internationally profound event was a privilege. And the funeral ceremony itself was a conduit for every view, opinion, anger and sadness that boiled about the world. Twenty years on, some of these emotions still unsettle many, but the nation delivered Diana, Princess of Wales from an imperfect world into the peace of her Althrop island grave, perfectly."
2017-09-01,"Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the former head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, has died aged 85.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/ex-archbishop-of-westminster-cardinal-cormac-murphy-oconnor-dies-11016049,"Cardinal Cormac served as the tenth Archbishop of Westminster from 2000 until his retirement in 2009. He was admitted to hospital last month after his health was said to have taken a ""defining turn"" during a cancer battle. Cardinal Cormac was ordained as a priest in Rome in 1956 at the age of 24, with Pope John Paul II appointing him a cardinal in 2001, a year after he took the role of Archbishop of Westminster. His replacement, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, described how Cardinal Cormac died ""peacefully"" at 3.15pm on Friday. He was surrounded by family and friends. In a statement, Cardinal Nichols, the current Archbishop of Westminster, added: ""Please pray for the repose of his soul. ""Pray, too, for his family, and those many friends and colleagues from the Diocese and far beyond who mourn his loss."" In a message posted on the church's website on Friday afternoon, Cardinal Cormac had asked Cardinal Vincent to relay how he was ""at peace"" and had ""no fear of what is to come"". Describing how he was ""privileged"" to have served as Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac added: ""I have received many blessings in my life, especially from my family and friends. ""I thank God for the many priests, religious and lay faithful who have helped and sustained me in my Episcopal life. ""Nor should I forget the many Anglican and Free Church colleagues whose friendship I have valued very much. ""Above all, as I now commend myself to the loving mercy of God, I ask them all to pray for me as I remember and pray for them."" Early into his tenure as Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac set up an investigation into child sex abuse in the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Following his retirement, he was later appointed by the Vatican to take a leading role in a probe into abuse in the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland. In 2015, Cardinal Cormac admitted he was ashamed of how he dealt with sex abuse allegations concerning a Catholic priest within his Sussex diocese in the 1980s, which he did not report to police. The priest, Michael Hill, went on to abuse more children and was jailed in 1997. His time as Archbishop of Westminster was also marked by a row with Tony Blair's Labour government over the rights of gay couples to adopt children. Cardinal Cormac had argued Catholic adoption agencies should be exempt from new laws, but later welcomed Mr Blair into the Catholic Church when the former prime minister converted after leaving office. Mr Blair and his wife Cherie, also a Catholic, paid tribute to Cardinal Cormac as ""a wonderful advertisement for Christianity and the Catholic Church"". They said in a statement: ""He led a life of commitment, dedication and compassion. But he also led a life of joy. ""He was a lovely person to be with and be around with a great sense of humour and the sharpest of wits. ""I found him always a source of wisdom and genuine friendship. We will miss him greatly and give thanks for his life."" In 2001, Cardinal Cormac became the first Catholic Cardinal to take part in an English royal funeral service since 1509 when he read prayers at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Anglican Church, said ""people saw something of Christ"" in Cardinal Cormac. ""The news of the death of Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor today represents a loss to his innumerable friends, to the church and to the country,"" he said. ""Cormac was a bishop for four decades but was first and foremost a servant of God and disciple of Jesus Christ. ""His humility, sense and holiness made him a church leader of immense impact."""
2017-09-01,"Premier League clubs have smashed summer transfer window spending records for a sixth consecutive year, according to analysis of their activities.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/premier-league-clubs-net-14bn-transfer-window-record-11015369,"Figures from Deloitte's sports business group showed the 20 top-flight teams collectively spent £1.43bn during the break between seasons - a rise of 23% on the previous year. They surpassed last summer's record with a week to spare before Thursday's 11pm deadline. The spree means gross spending by Premier League clubs has now broken the £10bn barrier since the first transfer window of January 2003. The highest-spending clubs were Manchester City at £215m, followed by £180m at Chelsea. Manchester United and Everton both spent £145m. The clubs' coffers have been bolstered by a £5.14bn three-year TV rights deal, which began in the 2016/17 season and which sees most of the broadcast games screened by Sky, the owner of Sky News, and some by BT. Deloitte said it was clear clubs were not getting out of their depth, calculating that transfer spending this summer as a proportion of estimated revenue for 2017/18 was 31% - though that was above the 27% average per season. The Premier League's spending was almost double that of Italy's Serie A - its closest rival in the European spending stakes. Sports business group partner Dan Jones said: ""With the continued growth in clubs' revenues, principally from broadcast rights, it is no surprise that Premier League clubs have continued to maintain their leading position in the world's player transfer market. ""Importantly, and when analysed in the context of generating record broadcast, commercial and matchday revenues, Premier League clubs are spending well within their means. ""For the last 15 years, annual transfer spending has remained within the range of between a fifth and a third, and averaged at around a quarter, of total revenues. ""With Premier League clubs' revenue showing no sign of decreasing in the foreseeable future, we would expect to see spending continue to rise."" The top five deals: :: Romelu Lukaku - £75m - Everton to Manchester United:: Alvaro Morata - £70m - Real Madrid to Chelsea:: Alexandre Lacazette - £52m - Lyon to Arsenal:: Kyle Walker - £50m - Tottenham to Manchester City:: Benjamin Mendy - £49.2m - Monaco to Manchester City"
2017-09-01,"Dissident Republicans have developed a new and highly dangerous under-car bomb, police in Northern Ireland have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/new-ira-develops-new-kind-of-bomb-northern-ireland-police-say-11016168,"The device, which involves a pressure plate designed to detonate when a car drives over it, was used to target an off-duty officer in Londonderry in February - but it did not detonate. A similar device was found in the Ballyarnett area of Derry in October 2014, police say. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) detective superintendent John McVea said the method of detonation, while not sophisticated, was ""very effective"". ""The New IRA have access to high explosives - which is concerning,"" he said. The bomb itself consists of a box of explosives wrapped in tape and placed under a car. The pressure plate detonator is activated when a car wheel drives over it. In the past, dissident Republicans have used magnetic under-car bombs, but that has become difficult because modern cars use plastic, Mr McVea said. Police are on high alert for more attacks from the New IRA, which is opposed to the peace process and was formed in 2012. The group, which gathers several dissident republican organisations, is believed to be the largest of its kind and has been linked to a number of attacks on police. Mr McVea said that in the February incident the plate detonator used to target the vehicle had failed to explode. It was discovered hours later on the driveway of the officer's home and exploded while it was being examined. The other known case in which the method was used was in Ballyarnett village in 2014 when a pressure plate was left under a mat with the intention of luring officers to stand on it. ""We believe the New IRA is responsible for both attacks. I can also confirm that the same type of pressure plate device was used on both occasions,"" said Detective Superintendent McVea. Police want anyone with any information on either of the two incidents to contact the incident room on 02871379793, or via 101, or alternatively call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2017-09-01,"Boots issued a legal warning to a pregnancy charity over its public campaign for more affordable emergency contraception, it has emerged.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/boots-sent-charity-bpas-legal-warning-over-morning-after-pill-abuse-11014950,"The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) revealed the high street chain accused it of encouraging ""personal abuse"" and ""harassment"" of top Boots executives. In a formal complaint issued on 1 August through law firm Schillings - often employed by celebrities - Boots alleged that BPAS helped cause ""immense personal distress"" to senior executives. It followed a row over Boots' pricing of the morning-after pill, with the company apologising in July for its ""poor choice of words"" after it initially resisted lobbying efforts by BPAS to reduce the cost of emergency contraception. The morning-after pill costs from £26.75 at Boots, while rivals Superdrug sell one brand of the emergency contraceptive at £13.49 and Tesco also stocks cheaper versions of the pill. Boots had said it ""would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use"" of the pill when, at first, it refused to review its pricing. The company later backtracked and vowed to look at stocking cheaper products amid public pressure to rethink its stance - including from MPs. BPAS's lobbying campaign, prompted by the much cheaper pricing of the morning-after pill abroad than in the UK, encouraged supporters to email Boots over its stance. A template on the campaign website previously included the names of five senior Boots employees for emails to be addressed to. Four were removed following the initial apology from Boots, but the name of one executive remains. On Thursday, BPAS was still encouraging supporters to contact the company in order to pressure it into acting on its pledge to reduce the price of the pill. Boots' legal letter alleges a ""torrent of personal abuse"" was directed at ITS employees as a result of the campaign, according to BPAS. But the charity says the chain ""comprehensively misrepresented"" messages it received from the public as a result of the campaign. It also claims that Boots ""demanded"" that details of its legal warning were not made public. Boots insists it was not seeking to stifle public debate over the issue of emergency contraception and had no problems with emails being sent to its customer services department. A Boots spokesperson said: ""As a responsible employer, we actively seek to protect our colleagues from abuse and harassment. ""In our legal letter to BPAS we made it very clear that we welcome the debate on the provision of EHC (emergency hormonal contraception), and respect their right to raise this issue with us. ""We asked them simply to remove personal email details from their campaign widget and to agree not to encourage personal abuse of our people. ""We provided examples of where our employees have received abuse by email and social media in response to BPAS's campaign. ""BPAS have not yet agreed to do this and we will continue to ask that they agree to our simple request, which was made only to protect the interests of our employees. ""We hope to receive a constructive response from BPAS, and do not wish to comment further at this time."" Amid the row over Boots' legal warning to BPAS, the chain announced it would be able to offer the morning-after pill Levonorgestrel at a cost of £15.99 across all its stores in October. The cheaper pill has already been on sale for the past month in 38 of its stores."
2017-09-01,Refuse collectors are set to strike again in Birmingham after the city council announced it would begin issuing redundancy notices to workers. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/birmingham-bin-strikes-set-to-resume-after-agreement-collapses-11015399,"The move scuppers a draft agreement that brought an end to seven weeks of strikes on 16 August. Union leaders called the council's move to issue redundancies, announced in a statement on Thursday night, a ""deeply provocative act"". It said it had driven a ""coach and horses"" through its agreement with workers. Large piles of rubbish had built up in Birmingham's streets during the summer after refuse workers downed tools in protest at jobs being downgraded, cuts to the workforce and the extension of a four-day week. The core of the dispute concerned plans to cut the jobs of grade-three workers who have responsibility for safety on bin lorries. Unite had hailed a victory in the campaign after seven weeks of striking on 16 August, announcing that city leaders had agreed to restore threatened jobs and suspending action to continue negotiations. But when the council postponed a key meeting and announced redundancies the union said strikes could recommence by Friday. ""Our members want to focus on delivering a safe, efficient service to people of Birmingham,"" said Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett. ""Sadly, it seems the council does not want to see that happen. Instead of embracing an agreement that would have seen compromise on all sides, the council seems content to put people on the dole and cut their wages by up to £5,000."" The council say changes are necessary to ""protect its legal and financial position"", and insist that jobs for the workers who have been made redundant will be created elsewhere. ""Alternative grade-three posts, at the same salary in other parts of the council, are available for all those affected leading hands,"" Lisa Trickett, in charge of waste services, said. ""No one needs to suffer a cut in their basic pay."" Council leader John Clancy said the new system would ""provide a better, more efficient and affordable service"". During the past round of strikes piles of refuse, dubbed ""rat hotels"", built up in the streets of Birmingham, attracting flies that residents said spread diseases. Javed Iqbal of the Alum Rock Community Forum slammed the ""disgusting, dangerous"" piles of rubbish and told Sky News that people had resorted to taking their trash to the tip themselves."

Carroll was at a set of traffic lights in his Jeep Wrangler in Hainault, northeast London, when O'Brien pulled up beside him on a motorcycle and demanded his watch. The Premier League star was then pursued by two suspects on motorbikes as he tried to escape, forcing him onto the wrong side of the road as he drove back to the training ground where there were security staff. The second driver has not been located. Carroll had initially thought the rider, who was wearing a crash helmet with a visor up, was boxer Kevin Mitchell pulling up for a chat, but as he went to drive off, the man said ""give me your watch"". He identified O'Brien in a police identity parade. In his 999 call, Carroll is heard telling the operator: ""Oh s***, I've hit loads of cars, I don't know what to do, he's just hit my car."" O'Brien, of Navarre Gardens, Romford, east London, was found guilty by a jury of six men and six women after six hours and 25 minutes of deliberations. He was given a sentence of 11 years and three months for the attempted robbery on Carroll and a previous ""campaign of burglaries"". Judge John Lodge told him: ""I have no doubt at all in saying that by reason of the planning of that sophisticated offence, the length of time that you pursued that vehicle, and that you were again using your motorcycle equipment as a disguise, you are at the very top of the bracket of culpability."" Police found O'Brien hiding under a mattress at a property in Dagenham, east London, when they went to arrest him 10 days after the attempted robbery. A motorcycle helmet, Ducati jacket and a Suzuki motorbike were all seized. DNA matching O'Brien was found on the helmet and jacket. It was heard that similar items had been used for a series of burglaries by O'Brien between October and November last year, in which cash and jewellery were taken. The defendant claimed he was not the biker in question and, while he had used the motorbike gear for other crimes, he had not on that occasion. His account was rejected by jurors. In a victim impact statement Carroll, who believed the defendant had a gun, said he ""feared for his life""."

There were no reported injuries and police said it is believed the projectile came from outside the ground. ""There have been no arrests,"" a Met Police spokesperson said. ""We retain an open mind as to motive. At this stage, the incident is not being treated as terrorism-related."" Surrey County County Cricket Club chief executive Richard Gould told Sky News: ""We don't know if were deliberately targeted or whether someone has been irresponsibly firing this sort of thing outside the ground.

Cricket fan David Schofield said he was told by three armed officers that it is believed two arrows were fired into the ground. ""They said there were two fired from the north east corner of the OCS stand of which one, they think, hit the roof,"" he said. ""They were definite it was from outside the stand.""

The programme claims to have undercover footage showing officers ""mocking, abusing and even assaulting detainees"" at the facility where drugs are allegedly ""rife"". The 448-capacity centre for adult men detained under immigration laws opened in March 2009. ""There is no place for the type of conduct described in the allegations anywhere in G4S, "" said Jerry Petherick, managing director for custodial and detention services. ""Such behaviour is not representative of the many G4S colleagues who do a great job, often in difficult and challenging circumstances, across the country. ""Once we have seen the evidence and concluded the investigation, I will ensure that we take the appropriate action."" Concerns were raised in a recent inspection which revealed that the average length of detention had increased from 28 to 48 days, with four men held there for more than two years. The inspection also highlighted issues with the ""stark and impersonal"" residential units and unsatisfactory sanitary facilities, leading detainees to feel they were being held in prison. The director of the immigration removal centre, Ben Saunders, said: ""Inspectors rightly identify that the purpose-built design is stark in some places and work is already under way to address that, including improving the screening in bathroom areas. ""We will work closely with the Home Office, who own the buildings, to look at how we can further soften the environment, for example by making greater use of the art created by detainees, especially where it has achieved recognition from arts charities."" Overall the report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke in March said it was an ""encouraging"" inspection. Brook House was deemed ""reasonably good"" in all four healthy establishment tests - safety, respect, activities and preparation for removal or release. ""We continue to focus on the care and wellbeing of detainees at Brook House,"" said Mr Petherick."

Chief Executive Neil Leitch told Sky News: ""The government's total refusal to tackle, or even acknowledge, the fundamental problem of early years under funding has left providers across the country struggling to find ways of delivering the offer that won't force them out of business."" ""Every week we're hearing of more and more childcare providers being forced to shut down as a result of the 30 hours. This simply cannot continue."" Under the new scheme, all three and four-year-olds in England will now be offered 30 free hours of childcare a week, up from 15 hours. The Government says around 390,000 working parents across the country are eligible for the increased free hours. At the George Perkins Day Nursery next to Edgbaston cricket ground in Birmingham they are proud of their ""outstanding"" rating but are trying to work out how they can balance the books. Suggestions that staff have heard discussed across the industry include a donation box in reception or even offering ironing services for parents that they could charge for. Qualified nursery worker Kerri Scott says it is demeaning and demoralising. ""As a parent I think it is great that we can offer childcare at a reasonable cost and free to some parents.... but as a practitioner they just haven't thought about how they are going to help the nurseries fund it. ""Another suggestion I have heard is that practitioners work for free for a term....it does make you feel devalued,"" she added. Nursery Manager Sarah Presswood told Sky News: ""This hang up on it having to be free is causing a lot of tension whereas a number of my parents have said why can't it be a subsidy?"" Education Secretary Justine Greening said: ""For too long lots of families really struggled to manage the cost of childcare and that's why we have delivered on our promise to provide 30 hours free - saving working families around £5,000 a year.

VW's UK scheme falls short of the terms offered to drivers in its home market. In Germany, it had already announced scrappage discounts worth around £9,000 under pressure from the national government following a top-level summit involving the industry, aimed at cutting pollution on the country's roads. The company announced it was focusing its development work on a new electric future in the wake of dieselgate. Its reputation hit the skids when it admitted cheating emissions testing regimes in the US through the fitting of software which reduced nitrogen oxide output. The fallout from the scandal is far from over stateside, with individuals facing criminal charges while fines and compensation have bloated a cost bill running into tens of billions of dollars. It has recalled 11 million vehicles in total worldwide, including 1.2 million in the UK, though it is refusing demands to pay compensation across Europe on the grounds it broke no laws. A number of other car manufacturers have been offering software updates to help keep emission levels in check, while Toyota, BMW, Ford, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz are among those with new car discount schemes. The industry will be hoping the offers bolster the sale of new cars in the UK following months of decline. VW announced its scrappage plans as new rules came into force covering the emissions testing of vehicles in Europe aimed at ensuring they take a greater account of exhaust output on the road rather than in a lab. The SMMT industry body said the new tests, which measure fuel consumption, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulates by mass and number, and carbon monoxide, were ""groundbreaking""."

2017-09-01,Kenya is to hold another presidential election after the previous poll was declared invalid by the country's supreme court.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/court-overturns-kenya-presidential-election-11015473,"Judges ruled by a majority of four to two that the win by President Uhuru Kenyatta was ""null and void"" as a result of irregularities committed by the election board. They ordered a fresh ballot be held within 60 days. It is the first time in Kenya's history a presidential election result has been cancelled. The country's stock exchange temporarily halted trading after blue chip shares plummeted in response to the decision. The historic move comes after a petition was filed by opposition candidate Raila Odinga. He had claimed the electronic voting results were hacked and rigged in favour of Mr Kenyatta. Concerns around the poll were fuelled after the official who oversaw the electronic voting system was found tortured and killed days before the election. International election observers said at the time that they had seen no interference with the August poll, which saw Mr Kenyatta win a second term with 54% of the vote. But Kenya's top court has now decided the poll was not conducted in line with the constitution. Judge David Maranga, announcing the verdict, said: ""The declaration (of Kenyatta's win) is invalid, null and void. ""The first respondent (the election board) failed, neglected or refused to conduct the presidential election in a manner consistent with the dictates of the constitution."" The court did not place any blame on Mr Kenyatta or his party. Mr Odinga said: ""This is a historic day for the people of Kenya and by extension for the people of the continent of Africa. ""For the first time in the history of African democratisation, a ruling has been made by a court nullifying irregular election of a president. This is a precedent-setting ruling."" The president's chief lawyer, Ahmednassir Abdulahi, told the court the quashing of the result was a ""very political decision"", but said they would live with the consequences. Ahead of the decision, Kenya had been braced for a repeat of the unrest that followed the August poll, in which human rights groups said police killed at least 24 people. Security was tight around the courthouse with armed police and barricaded streets. The legal ruling paves the way for a new race for the presidency between Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga. Mr Odinga has contested the last three elections and lost each time. On each occasion he has alleged the polls were rigged. A dispute over the 2007 poll, which Mr Odinga challenged after being declared the loser, was followed by weeks of ethnic bloodshed in which more than 1,200 were killed."

She later told a court how she had been held blindfolded in a makeshift ""coffin"" during the eight-day ordeal. During Sams' 1993 trial, Ms Slater described how she tried to befriend him so he would be less likely to harm her. She was freed after a £175,000 ransom was paid and her evidence later helped convict Sams of the 1991 murder of 18-year-old Julie Dart. After her kidnap, she worked with police to help them better deal with kidnap victims, and also with victims to help them get over their trauma. West Midlands Police have paid tribute to her work and for her ""courage and bravery over the years"". Speaking in 2011, Ms Slater said: ""Before this happened, I had a boyfriend, a job and a company car. I had loads of friends and a great social life. ""But he (Sams) took everything and destroyed the next 20 years of my life. ""But now I am ready to begin again. Most people begin their lives in their 20s or 30s but those years of my life were destroyed."" Her best friend, Stacey Ketner, said: ""We have had a unique and epic friendship for over 25 years and shared so much together, good and bad times. ""I know that she truly never got over the events that changed her life so dramatically in January 1992. It's been an honour and a privilege to be Stephanie's best friend."" Reporter Keith Wilkinson, a friend of Ms Slater's who made a documentary about her, said: ""The last time I saw her on the Isle of Wight to do some filming a few years ago, she was quite upbeat and positive. ""She could sometimes be hysterically funny and had many passions."" Killer Sams, now 76, was given a life sentence in 1993 for the murder and kidnap of Julie Dart and attempts to blackmail police."
2017-09-01,"One of Britain's biggest rent-to-own retailers has called in administrators, putting hundreds of jobs at risk and raising renewed fears about the wider health of the sector.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/rent-to-own-woes-deepen-as-buy-as-you-view-calls-in-administrator-11015646,"Sky News has learnt that the parent company of Buy As You View has appointed the professional services firm EY as administrator less than 18 months after agreeing a customer redress programme with the City watchdog. Dunraven Finance, which is based in Bridgend, Wales, has been struggling since the introduction of stricter lending controls by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and has racked up millions of pounds in losses. The move to appoint EY could threaten the jobs of the nearly 230 people who now work for the company, with 40 having been made redundant on Friday, according to sources. Last year, Rutland Partners, the private equity groups which sparked controversy over its stewardship of the Bernard Matthews pension scheme, lost control of Buy As You View in a deal which saw it taken over by its main lender. Buy As You View operates using a hire-purchase model under which consumers make weekly payments to rent products such as a television, fridge or furniture until they own it outright. The company has roughly 40,000 customers and recently switched to an online sales model in an effort to drive down costs. In addition to its headquarters, it has five smaller offices and distribution hubs across the country. Insiders said that EY would seek to reassure Buy As You View customers that their repayment schedules would remain in place during the period of administration. Customers should adhere to their agreements with the company to protect their personal credit rating and maintain service levels, a person close to it said. A buyer will now be sought for the business, although the broader environment facing rent-to-own retailers is already becoming significantly tougher. The FCA took over responsibility for regulating consumer credit firms in 2015, and a year later forced Buy As You View to repay nearly £1m to 59,000 customers who had been unfairly treated by the company. Late last year, Hayfin Capital Management, Buy As You View's lender, took control of the business but has been unable to stem its losses. Bright House, Buy As You View's larger rival, is also undergoing a restructuring of its own, with lenders submitting a revised plan to the FCA and other stakeholders in recent weeks. Alteri, a fund affiliated to the hedge fund giant Apollo Global Management, holds approximately 30% of Bright House's senior bonds and is expected to push in the near term for a debt-for-equity swap. Other players in the sector include Perfect Home. EY confirmed its appointment, saying that ""the directors of Buy As You View concluded reluctantly that they should place the company into administration to allow options to be assessed by the joint administrators and to enable further restructuring to be undertaken""."
2017-09-01,"The threat to the UK from returning Islamic State jihadists is not as significant as police and intelligence agencies had originally feared, security sources have told Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/homegrown-extremists-more-threat-to-uk-than-returning-islamic-state-jihadists-11014711,"However, the threat from homegrown extremists has reached unprecedented levels, with significant numbers of people being directly encouraged or instructed to carry out attacks. One source said: ""The threat picture has diversified enormously in recent months and is likely to remain severe for the foreseeable future. ""As IS comes under pressure in Raqqa, as they did in Mosul, the impetus to go and join them has started to dissipate, but their message remains potent for those willing to listen. ""Part of the problem is that propaganda had democratised the threat so that self-starters and lone actors can view material that is pumped out encouraging them to get out with knives or vehicles to launch these low-tech attacks."" More than 800 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS. Police and security services feared that, as the terror group crumbled in the Middle East, hundreds would find their way back home as fully-trained killers. But the actual number of jihadist returners is significantly less than they expected. Around 350 British citizens have already returned to the UK. Some have been prosecuted, but police believe most of the others were probably not directly associated with IS. Sky News has been told up to 200 British fighters are believed to have been killed in the Middle East, with the remainder either unwilling or too afraid to return for fear of prosecution. The source said: ""We now think that fewer are likely to return from Syria and Iraq than had previously been feared, partly because they are likely to have been killed in the fighting as it escalates and partly because those that survive are likely to seek refuge in other countries. ""The threat from those who have never left the UK for Syria and Iraq is the predominant threat - they are still highly motivated and increasingly they are taking direction from individuals in the Middle East."" Authorities tell us they are monitoring around 100 British jihadists who they believe may return, so that threat has not gone away. Security minister Ben Wallace MP said: ""I think what has happened is IS has very cleverly switched tactics. ""They have realised that they cannot get the supply of fighters into Syria and Iraq and indeed they have been defeated, predominantly in Iraq. ""But at the same time, IS think they need to spread terror, so what we have seen them do is use more inspiration, use more of the internet to radicalise those people to take action at home, and do whatever they can to kill people."" Intelligence agencies believe that advances in communications technology - such as encrypted chat websites and apps - are allowing those in the heart of the warzone in the Middle East to directly encourage radicalised individuals at home. The UK's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Max Hill QC, told Sky News: ""It is not always possible to find a back door into device to device encrypted communication, but there are ways in which the tech companies, can and should be co-operating with law enforcement."" The template for increased terror activity in the West was set more than a decade ago, with the dismantling of al Qaeda. Under intense pressure from coalition strikes, the group urged followers to launch attacks in London, Madrid and in other western cities. But terrorism experts say the authorities have an ever greater challenge this time around. Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, said: ""The difficulty for the security services is that they have now got a threat picture that is now so diffuse; it's incredibly easy for anyone to pick up a knife, get into a car, and commit something, which from their perspective, they would consider a terrorist act in advance of their cause."" UK authorities believe there are as many as 3,500 individuals here who have an Islamist extremist mindset and may be susceptible to messages encouraging them to turn to violence. The terror threat the UK faces, we are told, is not about to go away anytime soon."
2017-09-01,UK drivers face the prospect of a jump in petrol costs next week because of a steep rise in wholesale prices being blamed on the effects of Hurricane Harvey.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/hurricane-harvey-blamed-for-looming-jump-in-uk-fuel-costs-11015543,"The warning was sounded by an industry body which charted a rise of more than 4p-per-litre in wholesale costs over the past five days alone. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said the impact of that increase on its members would be felt by motorists in the coming days. The RAC said petrol was on course to overtake diesel costs for the first time in a year with average prices likely rising above 121p per litre - its highest level since 2014 - with no end to the surge currently in sight. Diesel, it predicted, would remain stable at around 118.5p. A spokesman for the motoring organisation, Pete Williams, said: ""The price of unleaded petrol will leapfrog diesel early next week, rising by up to 4p per litre as the impact of Storm Harvey and the shut-down of large refineries in the Gulf Coast drives up US demand for petrol imports. :: House-to-house search for Storm Harvey victims He added: ""One quarter of the refining capacity in the States remains offline leaving a shortfall of over four million barrels a day, and crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is down 13.5%. ""In response, oil traders are acting to redirect fuel to the US ahead of the busy Labor Day weekend surge in travel."" The PRA said it had been told by Platts, the independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets, that ""there have been a large number of oil tankers set to move to the US from Europe carrying gasoline to make up shortfalls in the Gulf region"". PRA chairman Brian Madderson added: ""This will be bad for UK inflation, for cash strapped UK motorists and for the economy as money is diverted from other purchases""."
2017-09-01,I'll admit I was rather shocked by Theresa May's answer to my question over whether she wanted to fight the next general election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/pm-had-little-choice-but-to-say-yes-to-another-election-11013977,"She responded with a straight ""yes"". Firstly, she'd not said it before; secondly, it was an unequivocal answer to a direct question by a Prime Minister who often avoids and deflects with planned soundbites, not always relevant to the enquiry. :: PM: I'm no quitter and will fight 2022 election Then I was left wondering, what choice did she have? At some point the Prime Minister had to put this question to bed. With reports, perhaps 'fake news', suggesting she'd set a date to resign - it was time to take a position. If she'd confirmed she was making a mid-term exit, after Brexit, that would have fired the gun for a two-year leadership race, immediately undermining her authority. So if she does eventually quit then, like her disastrous election, it has to be a snap decision. It could, however, also be the political determination of a woman described by Ken Clarke as ""bloody difficult"" and who has chosen to be bloody difficult to remove. After all, she's waited long enough for the job - and a lot can be learned from her opposition leader about blanking out the negative voices. She will have to do that today. Former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, former party chair Grant Shapps and Tory grandee Michael Heseltine all expressed surprise at her determination to go on. The critics tend to come from the Remain camp and supporters from the Eurosceptic side of the party. Those vocally supporting Mrs May include John Redwood, Boris Johnson and Peter Bone, who says she will ""emerge a national hero"" if she delivers Brexit. On that subject, the Japan trip is having mixed results. Mrs May appears to have a reassurance from her counterpart Shinzo Abe that he will work toward a free-trade deal with the UK based on the EU deal once that has been has been concluded. He also made positive sounds about continued investment in the UK after Brexit - but made clear that Japanese companies saw the UK as a ""gateway to the EU"" and they would be would be ""watching carefully"" how the UK approaches Brexit. Mr Abe's main concern seemed to be ""minimising the impact of Brexit"". He asked Mrs May for ""transparency and predictability"" during her EU exit negotiation. It's clear the Japanese PM sees Brexit as a damage limitation exercise - and as it happens that is what's going on in the Conservative Party right now following Mrs May disastrous snap election. Big questions remain over whether that includes restructuring at the top."
2017-09-01,"The Royal Air Force has become the first British military service to open up all roles to men and women, in what the Defence Secretary has called a ""defining moment"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/raf-opens-close-combat-roles-to-women-in-defining-moment-11015584,"But some members of the military expressed fears that the change might lower the standards of training and undermine the force's fighting power. The Government lifted the ban on females serving in close combat roles last year. As of Friday women can apply to join the RAF's ground-fighting force. The 2,000-strong RAF Regiment is deployed to protect bases and airfields across the world, and it has suffered casualties in Afghanistan. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: ""Individuals who are capable of meeting the standards for the regiment will be given the opportunity to serve, regardless of their gender. ""This is a defining moment for the RAF."" Allowing women on the frontline has put the UK's policy in line with nations such as the US and Australia. The US announced in 2015 it would open all jobs in combat roles to women following several years of research. Women make up only about 14% of the RAF, said Group Captain Wendy Rothery, head of RAF recruiting and selection. She told Sky News that about 20 women were already waiting in the pipeline and that ultimately the force expected roughly 200 applications. Still, the possibility that they might now serve in combat roles left some in the military sceptical. Major General Patrick Cordingley, a former commander of the 7th Armoured Brigade Desert Rats who led British tanks against the Iraqi army during the first Gulf War, said introducing women in tight living conditions during war would be an unnecessary distraction. ""That will be disruptive,"" he told Sky News. ""It's human nature."" Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said he was concerned over women's ""physical capabilities and the effects that long-term stresses and strains of infantry training and operations will have on a woman's body"". ""I think the reality is we will find many more women than men suffer injuries... and we will then undoubtedly see very significant compensation payments being made out of the defence budget,"" he told the BBC. ""And the nature of woman's bodies means that some of the injuries are going to be more significant in terms of being able to bear children and the like."" Air Commodore Frank Clifford, the commandant general of the RAF Regiment, told Sky News he understood the reservations but said standards would remain the same. ""I believe that a truly diverse force in this modern day and age will mean an improvement in our efficiency. ""I do understand the concerns but there will be no drop in standards, the physical requirements for fitness and agility will not change."" He added: ""We represent society. Times have changed, we move forward with those times."""

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the possible causes for the chemical cloud include discharges from a vessel, previously unreported lost cargo, and emissions from known shipwrecks. In a statement, it said: ""We have identified approximately 180 vessels that passed through the English Channel off the coast of Eastbourne on Sunday 27 August. ""We are working with all relevant Environmental and Public Health regulators to conclude these investigations."" Initially, it was believed the haze may have been caused by chemicals drifting over the English Channel. However, the Met Office said weather models indicated it was unlikely the haze came from northern France. Irritation was first reported by tourists visiting the clifftops and beach at Birling Gap near Eastbourne just before 5pm on Sunday. Some said they could smell chlorine, but the fire service said it was ""extremely unlikely"" to have been the chemical. The effects of the haze were reported as far as Bexhill and towards Hastings, more than 20 miles away. Patients were given full decontamination treatment as a precaution but police said it was soon clear that this was unnecessary. People were advised to wash all over with soap and water. Mark Battershill, who was one of those affected, told Sky News he was left with stinging eyes and a sore throat after coming into contact with the mystery chemical. He said some people had complained that they were having difficulty breathing."
2017-09-01,"David Davis has said he expects the Government to last a full five-year term, but declined to confirm that Theresa May would ""write the final chapter in Brexit"".

Mr Davis conceded Britain had been put under pressure to resolve the issue of the divorce bill, which EU negotiators insist is agreed upon before talks can move on to the next phase, including the crucial future trade relationship. But he would not be drawn on an interview by his cabinet colleague Liam Fox, who on Friday morning accused EU officials of ""blackmailing"" Britain over the bill. Mr Davis said he would not comment on the views of other ministers, but said: ""We are in a difficult and tough, complicated negotiation. ""I have said from the beginning, it will be turbulent. What we're having at the moment is the first ripple and there will be many more ripples along the way."" Asked how long the current Government would remain in power, and whether Mrs May would ""be able to write the final chapter in Brexit"", Mr Davis said it was ""my expectation"" that the Government would last five years, due to the Fixed Term Parliaments Act which made it difficult to have an early election. In fact, the Act was easily overridden by the Prime Minister to call the snap election in June, by calling a vote in the House of Commons. The Brexit Secretary did not mention Mrs May's stated plans, in interviews from Japan on Thursday, to fight the next election. But he insisted the Brexit negotiating timetable was on track, saying: ""There is a majority to carry through Brexit in the UK Parliament and it will get done. It will get done in time."" The speech to business leaders was a staunch defence of free trade - and in particular a UK-US trade deal - as the way to tackle the ""greatest social and economic challenges"" facing the world. In comments seen as a veiled warning to the Trump administration, he cautioned against a lurch towards protectionism and trade barriers as a response to the downsides of globalisation - a theme taken up by both Donald Trump and Mrs May. He said: ""My message is clear: the answer to these challenges is not to turn inwards and become isolationist. The answer to the economic problems of the West cannot be to turn our back on globalisation and trade - it's to lead the world forward once again."" But he conceded that while negotiations with the US on a trade deal could begin when Britain officially leaves the EU in March 2019, it could not be signed until Britain has agreed the terms of its future relationship with the bloc, which ministers concede could take another four year ""transition period"". In his speech, Mr Davis also tried to reassure a domestic and European audience that Britain would not engage in a ""regulatory race-to-the-bottom"" by slashing quality standards or wages, in order to compete with emerging economies such as China. The Brexit Secretary painted an optimistic picture of Britain's future outside the EU, and reiterated the Government's desire to agree trade and customs arrangements with the bloc which are as ""seamless and frictionless"" as possible. He said: ""There are many that doubt this is possible but when I spoke to my European counterpart Michel Barnier I said to him once: 'The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity, the optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty'. ""And as ever on that front I am a determined optimist in this - we will get to those opportunities. Because fundamentally I believe that a good deal is in the interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union and of the entire global community."" Mr Davis returned from the third round of exit talks in Brussels on Thursday, insisting at a terse news conference that ""some concrete progress"" had been made - only for Mr Barnier to retort that he thought there had been ""no decisive progress"" on the key issues of the divorce bill, the rights of EU citizens and the Northern Ireland border."
2017-09-01,"On the 10th anniversary of the smartphone's launch, Apple will release its iPhone 8 at an exclusive event at its ""spaceship"" campus in California.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/whats-going-to-be-in-the-iphone-8-when-it-launches-on-12-september-11015531,"More than a billion smartphones have been sold since Steve Jobs presented the first iPhone to the public on 9 January 2007. The device would redefine the mobile phone and make Apple the most valuable company in the world. The launch event for the iPhone 8 will be held in Cupertino, specifically in Apple's new Steve Jobs Theatre, a subterranean stadium which reportedly seats only 1,000 people. Apple's devices usually go on sale a week after the launch event and the company predicted it would drive strong sales for the fourth quarter of up to $52bn (£40bn). Leaks to retailers have suggested the phone will go on sale on Friday, 22 September. Speculation regarding what the iPhone 8 is likely to include has at times been wild, but some rumours and leaks have more credence than others. Here's Sky News' round-up of the most credible: :: iOS 11 The iPhone 8 will certainly be arriving with Apple's new mobile operating system iOS 11 which will include a feature to encourage safer driving by blocking notifications when the phone is connected to a car and in motion. Secret 999 fingerprint dialling will also be available, but the stand-out feature is going to be Apple's investments in augmented reality. :: Wireless charging No more cables and searching for free sockets - the iPhone 8 could feature wireless charging. Wireless charging uses a pad which transmits power to the device using an electromagnetic field which the phone's receiver coil can turn into charge. Apple's wireless charging technology however may be limited to 7.5 watts, half of the strength used in Samsung's version of the technology. :: Blush gold colour The phone appears to only arrive in three colours, although others may be available later. Images posted to Twitter by committed Apple leaker Benjamin Geskin: Foxconn's internal name of the new #iPhone8 color is ""Blush Gold"" (腮红金) Barcode says ""Blush Gold 64GB / 128GB"" pic.twitter.com/MZPTfVAr2P White and black are classical style choices for the company, but a third colour - dubbed ""Blush Gold"" internally at the manufacturer Foxconn - has been leaked. :: Edge-to-edge display The iPhone 8 is rumoured to be the device which finally meets the ambitions of Sir Jony Ive, the design chief at Apple, to have an edge-to-edge display with the screen covering the entirety of the front of the phone. Clues spotted in the code for Apple's HomePod speaker suggest the phone will have a 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED display. With a complete glass front, however, there will be no room for a home button. :: No home button And ineed, the iPhone 8 may be set to do away with the home button. A patent by the company allows its technology to embed Touch ID - it's fingerprint recognition technology - in the screen.

2017-09-01,"Researchers at the University of St Andrews are challenging people to claim $1m (£770,000) by finding the solution to a ""simple"" chess puzzle.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170901201640/http://news.sky.com/story/scientists-offer-1m-prize-to-solve-simple-chess-puzzle-11015899,"Computer programmers would be able to pocket the cash, which is offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute in America, if they found an efficient solution to the famous eight queens puzzle. The puzzle requires a player to place eight chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two queens are threatening each other. For an 8x8 chessboard, the solution requires that the queens don't share the same row, column, or diagonal - the directions in which chess queens can move. Considered as a mathematical problem, computer scientists have calculated there are 4,426,165,368 possible arrangements of the queens but of these arrangements, only 92 are acceptable solutions. Originally devised in 1850, the 8x8 puzzle has been solved by humans - but once the size of the chess board increases enough, computer programmes have found it impossible to solve. A paper published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research concludes that the team led by Professor Ian Gent at the University of St Andrews noted a solution would provide enormous benefits to the world. Professsor Gent said: ""If you could write a computer programme that could solve the problem really fast, you could adapt it to solve many of the most important problems that affect us all daily. ""This includes trivial challenges like working out the largest group of your Facebook friends who don't know each other, or very important ones like cracking the codes that keep all our online transactions safe."" The underlying problem is one of the most major unsolved problems in computer science and mathematics. Known as P versus NP, it is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems which carry the million dollar reward for their first correct solution. The P versus NP problem essentially asks whether, if it is easy to verify that the solution to a problem is correct, is it also easy to solve the problem too? It is ultimately a problem about problems. If there is a simple way to confirm that, for instance 967 multiplied by 839 equals 811,313, shouldn't it therefore be equally easy to prove that 967 and 839 are the prime factors of 811,313? Dr Nightingale said: ""However, this is all theoretical. In practice, nobody has ever come close to writing a programme that can solve the problem quickly. So what our research has shown is that - for all practical purposes - it can't be done."" Only one Millennium Prize Problem has been solved since they were established in 2000. Grigori Perelman turned down both the prize money and the Fields Medal, often called the Nobel Prize of Mathematics, for his work. Mr Perelman said: ""I'm not interested in money or fame; I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo."""

The person filming the attack can be heard laughing. A 43-year-old man was arrested in Melbourne on Wednesday evening and charged with one count of destroying protected wildlife, said Victoria state's Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. Firearms, knives and mobile phones were also seized. ""We take all alleged cases of animal cruelty very seriously... The wildlife offences captured in this video are particularly abhorrent,"" said the department's compliance operations manager Glenn Sharp.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the possible causes for the chemical cloud include discharges from a vessel, previously unreported lost cargo, and emissions from known shipwrecks. In a statement, it said: ""We have identified approximately 180 vessels that passed through the English Channel off the coast of Eastbourne on Sunday 27 August. ""We are working with all relevant Environmental and Public Health regulators to conclude these investigations."" Initially, it was believed the haze may have been caused by chemicals drifting over the English Channel. However, the Met Office said weather models indicated it was unlikely the haze came from northern France. Irritation was first reported by tourists visiting the clifftops and beach at Birling Gap near Eastbourne just before 5pm on Sunday. Some said they could smell chlorine, but the fire service said it was ""extremely unlikely"" to have been the chemical. The effects of the haze were reported as far as Bexhill and towards Hastings, more than 20 miles away. Patients were given full decontamination treatment as a precaution but police said it was soon clear that this was unnecessary. People were advised to wash all over with soap and water. Mark Battershill, who was one of those affected, told Sky News he was left with stinging eyes and a sore throat after coming into contact with the mystery chemical. He said some people had complained that they were having difficulty breathing."
2017-09-02,I'll admit I was rather shocked by Theresa May's answer to my question over whether she wanted to fight the next general election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170902205858/http://news.sky.com/story/pm-had-little-choice-but-to-say-yes-to-another-election-11013977,"She responded with a straight ""yes"". Firstly, she'd not said it before; secondly, it was an unequivocal answer to a direct question by a Prime Minister who often avoids and deflects with planned soundbites, not always relevant to the enquiry. :: PM: I'm no quitter and will fight 2022 election Then I was left wondering, what choice did she have? At some point the Prime Minister had to put this question to bed. With reports, perhaps 'fake news', suggesting she'd set a date to resign - it was time to take a position. If she'd confirmed she was making a mid-term exit, after Brexit, that would have fired the gun for a two-year leadership race, immediately undermining her authority. So if she does eventually quit then, like her disastrous election, it has to be a snap decision. It could, however, also be the political determination of a woman described by Ken Clarke as ""bloody difficult"" and who has chosen to be bloody difficult to remove. After all, she's waited long enough for the job - and a lot can be learned from her opposition leader about blanking out the negative voices. She will have to do that today. Former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, former party chair Grant Shapps and Tory grandee Michael Heseltine all expressed surprise at her determination to go on. The critics tend to come from the Remain camp and supporters from the Eurosceptic side of the party. Those vocally supporting Mrs May include John Redwood, Boris Johnson and Peter Bone, who says she will ""emerge a national hero"" if she delivers Brexit. On that subject, the Japan trip is having mixed results. Mrs May appears to have a reassurance from her counterpart Shinzo Abe that he will work toward a free-trade deal with the UK based on the EU deal once that has been has been concluded. He also made positive sounds about continued investment in the UK after Brexit - but made clear that Japanese companies saw the UK as a ""gateway to the EU"" and they would be would be ""watching carefully"" how the UK approaches Brexit. Mr Abe's main concern seemed to be ""minimising the impact of Brexit"". He asked Mrs May for ""transparency and predictability"" during her EU exit negotiation. It's clear the Japanese PM sees Brexit as a damage limitation exercise - and as it happens that is what's going on in the Conservative Party right now following Mrs May disastrous snap election. Big questions remain over whether that includes restructuring at the top."

2017-09-02,"Dissident Republicans have developed a new and highly dangerous under-car bomb, police in Northern Ireland have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170902205858/http://news.sky.com/story/new-ira-develops-new-kind-of-bomb-northern-ireland-police-say-11016168,"The device, which involves a pressure plate designed to detonate when a car drives over it, was used to target an off-duty officer in Londonderry in February - but it did not detonate. A similar device was found in the Ballyarnett area of Derry in October 2014, police say. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) detective superintendent John McVea said the method of detonation, while not sophisticated, was ""very effective"". ""The New IRA have access to high explosives - which is concerning,"" he said. The bomb itself consists of a box of explosives wrapped in tape and placed under a car. The pressure plate detonator is activated when a car wheel drives over it. In the past, dissident Republicans have used magnetic under-car bombs, but that has become difficult because modern cars use plastic, Mr McVea said. Police are on high alert for more attacks from the New IRA, which is opposed to the peace process and was formed in 2012. The group, which gathers several dissident republican organisations, is believed to be the largest of its kind and has been linked to a number of attacks on police. Mr McVea said that in the February incident the plate detonator used to target the vehicle had failed to explode. It was discovered hours later on the driveway of the officer's home and exploded while it was being examined. The other known case in which the method was used was in Ballyarnett village in 2014 when a pressure plate was left under a mat with the intention of luring officers to stand on it. ""We believe the New IRA is responsible for both attacks. I can also confirm that the same type of pressure plate device was used on both occasions,"" said Detective Superintendent McVea. Police want anyone with any information on either of the two incidents to contact the incident room on 02871379793, or via 101, or alternatively call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2017-09-02,Many people are reflecting on where they were when the news of Diana Princess of Wales's death was announced.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170902205858/http://news.sky.com/story/princess-diana-the-royal-death-that-shocked-the-world-11013222,"For me it's easy. I was in bed at home and woke when the 'pager', which Sky News insisted I carry at all times, buzzed into life. Bleary eyed, I reached for it and read the code words I half expected ""Royal Down"". All broadcasters had for some time prepared themselves to respond to the Queen Mother dying. She seemed eternal but was then in her 97th year. Seconds later, my mother came into the room and told me what she had just seen on the television. The shock was intense. Diana was my age. Her life had seemed agonisingly complicated and public in the months preceding this jolt, but this development was beyond all fathom. As Sky's Commentator of National Events, it was not immediately clear what my role might be. After all, the marriage between Prince Charles and Diana had been over for some time and it didn't seem likely that a Royal Ceremonial Funeral would follow. My instinct (how wrong I was), leant towards a Spencer family funeral. The only part of this that arguably did transpire was that the Spencer's retained a strong lead in presence and style and, after 10 fraught days, Diana found her eternal rest on the island in the lake of her family home. Diana was a phenomenon and so, as frequently happens in Britain, events took hold of protocols and made them bend to a ferocious public expectation and utility. By the time I was sat in the studio at Osterley at 9am on the morning of the funeral - the audible apex to a gargantuan team effort by Sky - the United Kingdom had writhed through a heart attack of sorts. In the middle of this wounded lion's cage stood the courtiers at Buckingham Palace, who had zero precedent to draw on and must have had to fumble in search of the right solution. While this evolved, the newly elected and exceptionally popular Government had a strong influence, the media's views were everywhere and Diana's family must have fought for space. The Armed Forces were put on standby but, for what? Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Ross was the Queen's principal adviser on ceremonial matters. We had both served in the Scots Guards and I'm sure his training must have helped. His team, in what is called the Lord Chamberlain's Office, worked through the nations emotions to fix upon a ceremonial and an Order of Service. Any family that faces bereavement, especially a shock one, must recognise that there can be difficulties. I'm sure errors of approach must have been made by all sides, many might have been disappointed by stands taken or ideas posed but, in the end, the book of protocol produced a unique ceremony for a unique person. The template for Diana's funeral, at Westminster Abbey, was indeed that held for the ageing Queen Mother but marching servicemen were replaced by representatives of countless charities and great organisations, which this great icon of a mother had championed. And there in the centre, where in 1920 for the State Funeral of the Unknown Warrior the King Emperor, George V walked, were Diana's two boys. Men now, but boys then. And the impression upon crowd and world was intense. Ceremony and event are the servants of emotion, though sometimes they can tweak it. On 6 September 1997, as the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery and Welsh Guards Bearer Party stepped off from Kensington Palace, the global catharsis of mourning and healing began. In the seconds before going live to commentate the event, I thought much of the young girl whose father had been a school friend of my father's in the war. The young woman who had been friend to so many I knew. It was a grim duty, but to be a part of what was actually a striking and internationally profound event was a privilege. And the funeral ceremony itself was a conduit for every view, opinion, anger and sadness that boiled about the world. Twenty years on, some of these emotions still unsettle many, but the nation delivered Diana, Princess of Wales from an imperfect world into the peace of her Althrop island grave, perfectly."

Professional footballers past and present also took part, including David Seaman, Peter Crouch, David James, Shay Given, Trevor Sinclair and Jamie Redknapp, as well as Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah and McFly singer Danny Jones. They were split into two teams: one headed by former QPR and England striker Les Ferdinand, and the other coached by former England captain Alan Shearer. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho joined Team Shearer as goalkeeper midway through the second half. The stadium fell silent before the game began in memory of the 80 people who lost their lives in the devastating blaze on 14 June. Game4Grenfell was the brainchild of Ferdinand, who grew up on the Lancaster West Estate beside the 24-storey tower. Just two minutes into the game, Sir Mo scored the first goal for Team Ferdinand, as the athlete celebrated by performing his trademark 'Mobot' along with his teammates. The match finished 2-2 after 90 minutes and then went to penalties. Team Ferdinand eventually triumphed 5-3, with Murs scoring the winning penalty past Mourinho. Loftus Road is just a mile away from Grenfell Tower, and money raised from the charity game is going to the Evening Standard's fund for those hit by the tragedy. More than 14,000 tickets were sold, with a further 3,000 given to survivors, residents, volunteers and the emergency services. For one family in particular, the football game was a much-needed opportunity to escape the heartache they've experienced since the Grenfell fire. Earlier this week, Karim Mussilhy and his family received confirmation that their Uncle Hesham Rahman, 57, had been formally identified as someone who died. Paying tribute to his uncle, Mr Mussilhy said: ""Hesham was very loving, kind and generous. He loved children and was a huge part of our family. ""He lived on the top floor of the tower and had diabetes so would have struggled to get down the stairs. We last spoke to him at 3am when he said he had been told to stay inside and someone was coming for him. ""We know that on the night of the fire he went to one of his neighbours who had young children and we have heard video of him comforting them while their mother was upset. ""He was calm, trying to make people less scared and frightened, keeping the peace. That says a lot about who he was. That's how I want him to be remembered, as a hero."" Mr Mussilhy's nine-year-old son, Kai, was a mascot for the game. ""Kai hasn't stopped talking about it since he found out he was a mascot,"" he added. ""It has been amazing to see all the children of this community smiling again, taking part in activities, seeing the celebrities. It is a day off from everything they've experienced and is much needed."" :: To give £3, text GRENFELL to 70007. Texts cost £3 plus one standard rate message."

He visited Houston, the state's biggest city, before making his way to Lake Charles in neighbouring Louisiana. Both have seen mass evacuations because of the historic flooding. Mr Trump's first stop was a shelter, where he visited a section reserved for child survivors and listened to their stories. He spoke of seeing ""a lot of love"" and ""a lot of happiness"" after high-fiving one boy and picking up a girl to give her a kiss. The Trumps later handed out hot dogs in white boxes bearing the Red Cross logo, pausing frequently to greet and take selfies with enthusiastic aid recipients. They then moved on to a church in Pearland, where Mr Trump praised officials' ""terrific"" rescue effort. He told volunteers handing out food and hygiene products: ""I don't know if it gets better, but we're going to try to make it better."" Mr Trump was criticised after his first visit for not meeting those directly affected by the storm, which has so far killed 50 people and left one million displaced. But the White House said he did not want to get in the way of the relief effort. Sky's US Correspondent Cordelia Lynch, reporting from the Houston neighbourhood of Westchester, said: ""People are dealing with rising floodwaters, despite the fact that the water is receding in other areas. ""That's because there has been a controlled release of water from reservoirs. ""We're going from home to home with residents, trying to negotiate quite perilous waters, so people can salvage what's in their homes."" The President has asked Congress for an initial $7.85bn (£6.1bn) in disaster relief in the wake of the storm. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the request is a ""downpayment on the President's commitment to help affected states recover from the storm"". Further funding requests are expected to address longer-term rebuilding needs as the full impact of the storm becomes clear. Harvey was the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in half a century - dumping unprecedented amounts of rain across more than 300 miles (480km) of the state's coast."

Soldiers and armed residents have been accused of carrying out a killing spree against Rohingya Muslim men, women, and children in Chut Pyin village, leaving more than 200 dead. They have also set fire to ""numerous"" villages throughout northern Rakhine state in the last week, displacing tens of thousands, according to Bangkok-based watchdog Fortify Rights. About 58,600 Rohingya civilians have left Myanmar, also known as Burma, and fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. Some have drowned while trying to make the journey. Mr Johnson has expressed hope that Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, will be able to use ""all her remarkable qualities to unite her country, to stop the violence and to end the prejudice that afflicts both Muslims and other communities in Rakhine"". In a statement, he said: ""Aung Sang Suu Kyi is rightly regarded as one of the most inspiring figures of our age but the treatment of the Rohingya is alas besmirching the reputation of Burma. ""She faces huge challenges in modernising her country... It is vital that she receives the support of the Burmese military, and that her attempts at peacemaking are not frustrated. ""She and all in Burma will have our full support in this."" The Buddhist-majority government has blamed militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) for burning down the homes, and also accused them of killing Buddhists. Fortify Rights reported villagers armed with swords and knives hacked and beheaded Rohingya residents, including children, in Chut Pyin. Soldiers reportedly arrested a large group of Rohingya men, marched them into a nearby bamboo hut and set it on fire, burning them to death. A 41-year-old man called Abdul Rahman, who claimed he survived the attack, said his two young nephews had been beheaded. He told Fortify Rights: ""My brother was killed. (Soldiers) burned him with the group. We found (my other family members) in the fields. ""They had marks on their bodies from bullets and some had cuts. My two nephews, their heads were off. One was six years old and the other was nine years old. My sister-in-law was shot with a gun."" According to Fortify Rights, survivors from two other villages - Kyet Yoe Pyin and Ba Da Kha Ywa Thit - also described beheadings and throats being cut. Residents from many other villages described arson attacks and soldiers opening fire on fleeing civilians, including children, the watchdog added. The latest violence erupted over a week ago when the rebels attacked remote police posts, killing 15 officials. The ARSA, who say they are defending the Rohingya from persecution by Myanmar, claimed responsibility for the security post assaults that sparked a large army counteroffensive. The escalation in fighting has seen about 400 people killed in recent days and more than 2,600 houses burnt down. The treatment of the 1.1 million Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is accused by Western critics of not speaking out for a minority that has long complained of persecution. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Myanmar of ""genocide"" against the Rohingya, while UN chief Antonio Guterres has warned of a looming humanitarian catastrophe in western Myanmar."

This year members of the public will visit 20 different sites as part of the Big Bottle Count and the #OneLess campaign working to cut the amount of ocean pollution. The number of volunteers has risen in recent years with 100 people trained up by charity Thames21 annually. The charity says their citizen scientists are ""the last line of defence in the battle against the plastic tide, and stopping it from reaching the sea"". Chris Coode, deputy chief executive of Thames21, told Sky News volunteer involvement is hugely significant. ""They have local knowledge and they know their local site really well… if we have a good network of citizen scientists we can build up a huge picture of data. ""We can have many more people capturing much more data than you could have with a paid scientist. ""…this is the key thing with citizen science if you can support them properly and create a method that is scientifically robust, so the data you are collecting actual scientists can use, then you can pass that information onto scientists who can analyse it. ""Then you're actually capturing a lot more data than you would otherwise be able to do through conventional science means. ""Also your citizen scientists become ambassadors for the cause."" The Big Bottle Count aims to remove plastic from the Thames but also to investigate where the bottles are coming from, where they are ending up and how their entry into the river can be stopped. The #OneLess campaign is ""working to create a refill revolution in London, creating a culture where using a refillable water bottle is the norm"". According to Thames21 the average adult in London buys 175 bottles of water a year. The campaign and project coincides with an art installation tour of the banks of the river which showcases plastic retrieved from the Thames over a one-year period. Artist Maria Arceo decided to do the project when she found a pair of sandals on the side of the river which are believed to be 100 years old. Maria says she began questioning how long plastic would be in our oceans if leather could last a century in water. The installation is called Future Dust and is in the shape of a giant footprint. ""This is only a fraction of what is out there,"" she said. ""If you can multiply what I find if I just do one beach each day all over the Thames then what I pick up in one beach will be multiplied by all those other beaches. ""…and compared to all rivers around the world in comparison this is a clean river so I want people to realise just because it looks clean it doesn't mean it is. We need to change the way we behave."" :: You can find out more about Sky Ocean Rescue and get involved by visiting the campaign's website."

2017-09-02,The biggest asteroid in more than a century has whizzed past Earth at a safe - but unusually close - distance.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170902205858/http://news.sky.com/story/asteroid-florence-zooms-past-earth-in-historic-fly-by-11017680,"Asteroid Florence and its two orbiting moons passed 4.4 million miles from the planet, its closest encounter since 1890. It measures in at almost three miles wide - the size of 30 Egyptian pyramids stuck together - and experts predict that this was the closest the asteroid will be to Earth until 2500. Astronomers at the Arecibo observatory in Puerto Rico have released a video of the fly-by, and NASA is using radar images to study the asteroid's real size. Named after Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, the asteroid was discovered in 1981. Although collisions with Earth are rare, an asteroid the size of a car hits the Earth's atmosphere about once a year. However, it burns up before reaching the surface. ""About every 2,000 years or so, a meteoroid the size of a football field hits Earth and causes significant damage to the area,"" NASA said. ""Finally, only once every few million years, an object large enough to threaten Earth's civilization comes along."" Thankfully, scientists are confident that Florence is not going to be one of them."

An arrow landed in the grounds during a county championship clash between Surrey and Middlesex at about 4.20pm. Play was abandoned and fans were evacuated, but there were no reports of injuries. One witness described seeing players and umpires running off the field before hundreds of spectators were told to move inside. Pictures showed umpire Paul Baldwin holding the pink-coloured bolt, and armed police attended the scene. Officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward, especially if they have any video footage. The suspect has been released on bail until late September pending further enquiries. Detective Constable Dominic Landragin said: ""There were significant crowds watching the match. ""And it is likely that a number of those present will have footage of the incident that could assist in our investigation.

Is it the full span, or is it the distance from one side of a river, valley or gorge to the other? It isn't the most glamorous, but technically the Bromford Viaduct - spanning three-and-a-half miles over Spaghetti Junction between Castle Bromwich and Gravelly Hill in Birmingham - is the longest. It was built between 1964 and 1972. :: Oldest Another difficult one to confirm, but the oldest standing bridge could well be the Tarr Steps - a ""clapper bridge"" between Withypool and Dulverton in Somerset. The Grade I listed building, built in medieval times, is formed of massive stones and spans 55m (180ft) across the River Barle in Exmoor National Park. Owing to flood damage, the ancient structure has had to be repaired. Legend claims the devil built the bridge so he could sunbathe on its stones. :: Tallest Costing £1.35bn, the newly-opened Queensferry Crossing reaches 207m (679ft) above the Firth of Forth - that's the equivalent of 48 London buses stacked on top of each other. Carrying the M90 between Edinburgh and Fife, the cable-stayed bridge is the third to cross the water and was finally opened to traffic on 30 August after almost six years of construction. As it was built, remnants of a Mesolithic dwelling were discovered on the south bank of the Forth dating back to around 8300 BC - the earliest known dwelling in Scotland. :: Most famous The star of blockbuster movies, Tower Bridge is one of the most recognisable features in the capital. Opened in 1894, some 40,000 people cross the bridge every day. Patriotic red, white and blue paint was added in 1977 as part of the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations. You can even watch the bridge live 24 hours a day on a HD webcam. :: And finally... London Bridge, the one in the nursery rhyme and a poem by T.S. Eliot, wins the award for the most travelled UK bridge. The previous crossing was dismantled in 1967 and relocated more than 5,000 miles away to Lake Havasu City in Arizona. Exterior granite blocks from the 1830s bridge now clad London Bridge in the US city, which was completed in 1971. The current crossing in the UK capital was completed in 1973 and now carries the A3 over the River Thames."

He was admitted to hospital last month after his health was said to have taken a ""defining turn"" during a cancer battle. Cardinal Cormac was ordained as a priest in Rome in 1956 at the age of 24, with Pope John Paul II appointing him a cardinal in 2001, a year after he took the role of Archbishop of Westminster. His replacement, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, described how Cardinal Cormac died ""peacefully"" at 3.15pm on Friday. He was surrounded by family and friends. In a statement, Cardinal Nichols, the current Archbishop of Westminster, added: ""Please pray for the repose of his soul. ""Pray, too, for his family, and those many friends and colleagues from the Diocese and far beyond who mourn his loss."" In a message posted on the church's website on Friday afternoon, Cardinal Cormac had asked Cardinal Vincent to relay how he was ""at peace"" and had ""no fear of what is to come"". Describing how he was ""privileged"" to have served as Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac added: ""I have received many blessings in my life, especially from my family and friends. ""I thank God for the many priests, religious and lay faithful who have helped and sustained me in my Episcopal life. ""Nor should I forget the many Anglican and Free Church colleagues whose friendship I have valued very much. ""Above all, as I now commend myself to the loving mercy of God, I ask them all to pray for me as I remember and pray for them."" Early into his tenure as Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac set up an investigation into child sex abuse in the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Following his retirement, he was later appointed by the Vatican to take a leading role in a probe into abuse in the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland. In 2015, Cardinal Cormac admitted he was ashamed of how he dealt with sex abuse allegations concerning a Catholic priest within his Sussex diocese in the 1980s, which he did not report to police. The priest, Michael Hill, went on to abuse more children and was jailed in 1997. His time as Archbishop of Westminster was also marked by a row with Tony Blair's Labour government over the rights of gay couples to adopt children. Cardinal Cormac had argued Catholic adoption agencies should be exempt from new laws, but later welcomed Mr Blair into the Catholic Church when the former prime minister converted after leaving office. Mr Blair and his wife Cherie, also a Catholic, paid tribute to Cardinal Cormac as ""a wonderful advertisement for Christianity and the Catholic Church"". They said in a statement: ""He led a life of commitment, dedication and compassion. But he also led a life of joy. ""He was a lovely person to be with and be around with a great sense of humour and the sharpest of wits. ""I found him always a source of wisdom and genuine friendship. We will miss him greatly and give thanks for his life."" In 2001, Cardinal Cormac became the first Catholic Cardinal to take part in an English royal funeral service since 1509 when he read prayers at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Anglican Church, said ""people saw something of Christ"" in Cardinal Cormac. ""The news of the death of Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor today represents a loss to his innumerable friends, to the church and to the country,"" he said. ""Cormac was a bishop for four decades but was first and foremost a servant of God and disciple of Jesus Christ. ""His humility, sense and holiness made him a church leader of immense impact."""

Union leaders called the council's decision to issue redundancies, announced on Thursday night, a ""deeply provocative act"". It said it had driven a ""coach and horses"" through its agreement with workers. Large piles of rubbish had built up in Birmingham's streets during the summer after refuse workers downed tools in protest at jobs being downgraded, cuts to the workforce and the extension of a four-day week. The core of the dispute concerned plans to cut the jobs of grade-three workers who have responsibility for safety on bin lorries. Unite had hailed a victory in the campaign after seven weeks of striking on 16 August, announcing that city leaders had agreed to restore threatened jobs and suspending action to continue negotiations. But when the council postponed a key meeting and announced redundancies the union recommenced strikes. ""Our members want to focus on delivering a safe, efficient service to people of Birmingham,"" said Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett. ""Sadly, it seems the council does not want to see that happen. Instead of embracing an agreement that would have seen compromise on all sides, the council seems content to put people on the dole and cut their wages by up to £5,000."" The council say changes are necessary to ""protect its legal and financial position"", and insist that jobs for the workers who have been made redundant will be created elsewhere. ""Alternative grade-three posts, at the same salary in other parts of the council, are available for all those affected leading hands,"" Lisa Trickett, in charge of waste services, said. ""No one needs to suffer a cut in their basic pay."" Council leader John Clancy said the new system would ""provide a better, more efficient and affordable service"". During the past round of strikes piles of refuse, dubbed ""rat hotels"", built up in the streets of Birmingham and attracted flies that residents said spread diseases. Birmingham resident Hafiz Ahmed said he feared the fresh strike would turn the city into a ""third world country"". He told Sky News: ""If the binmen are on strike (the council) should get private people to come in and collect the rubbish. ""Otherwise people will get sick, blind people could fall over, anything could happen."""
2017-09-02,"The Royal Air Force has become the first British military service to open up all roles to men and women, in what the Defence Secretary has called a ""defining moment"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170902205858/http://news.sky.com/story/raf-opens-close-combat-roles-to-women-in-defining-moment-11015584,"But some members of the military expressed fears that the change might lower the standards of training and undermine the force's fighting power. The Government lifted the ban on females serving in close combat roles last year. As of Friday women can apply to join the RAF's ground-fighting force. The 2,000-strong RAF Regiment is deployed to protect bases and airfields across the world, and it has suffered casualties in Afghanistan. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: ""Individuals who are capable of meeting the standards for the regiment will be given the opportunity to serve, regardless of their gender. ""This is a defining moment for the RAF."" Allowing women on the frontline has put the UK's policy in line with nations such as the US and Australia. The US announced in 2015 it would open all jobs in combat roles to women following several years of research. Women make up only about 14% of the RAF, said Group Captain Wendy Rothery, head of RAF recruiting and selection. She told Sky News that about 20 women were already waiting in the pipeline and that ultimately the force expected roughly 200 applications. Still, the possibility that they might now serve in combat roles left some in the military sceptical. Major General Patrick Cordingley, a former commander of the 7th Armoured Brigade Desert Rats who led British tanks against the Iraqi army during the first Gulf War, said introducing women in tight living conditions during war would be an unnecessary distraction. ""That will be disruptive,"" he told Sky News. ""It's human nature."" Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said he was concerned over women's ""physical capabilities and the effects that long-term stresses and strains of infantry training and operations will have on a woman's body"". ""I think the reality is we will find many more women than men suffer injuries... and we will then undoubtedly see very significant compensation payments being made out of the defence budget,"" he told the BBC. ""And the nature of woman's bodies means that some of the injuries are going to be more significant in terms of being able to bear children and the like."" Air Commodore Frank Clifford, the commandant general of the RAF Regiment, told Sky News he understood the reservations but said standards would remain the same. ""I believe that a truly diverse force in this modern day and age will mean an improvement in our efficiency. ""I do understand the concerns but there will be no drop in standards, the physical requirements for fitness and agility will not change."" He added: ""We represent society. Times have changed, we move forward with those times."""

Carroll was at a set of traffic lights in his Jeep Wrangler in Hainault, northeast London, when O'Brien pulled up beside him on a motorcycle and demanded his watch. The Premier League star was then pursued by two suspects on motorbikes as he tried to escape, forcing him onto the wrong side of the road as he drove back to the training ground where there were security staff. The second driver has not been located. Carroll had initially thought the rider, who was wearing a crash helmet with a visor up, was boxer Kevin Mitchell pulling up for a chat, but as he went to drive off, the man said ""give me your watch"". He identified O'Brien in a police identity parade. In his 999 call, Carroll is heard telling the operator: ""Oh s***, I've hit loads of cars, I don't know what to do, he's just hit my car."" O'Brien, of Navarre Gardens, Romford, east London, was found guilty by a jury of six men and six women after six hours and 25 minutes of deliberations. He was given a sentence of 11 years and three months for the attempted robbery on Carroll and a previous ""campaign of burglaries"". Judge John Lodge told him: ""I have no doubt at all in saying that by reason of the planning of that sophisticated offence, the length of time that you pursued that vehicle, and that you were again using your motorcycle equipment as a disguise, you are at the very top of the bracket of culpability."" Police found O'Brien hiding under a mattress at a property in Dagenham, east London, when they went to arrest him 10 days after the attempted robbery. A motorcycle helmet, Ducati jacket and a Suzuki motorbike were all seized. DNA matching O'Brien was found on the helmet and jacket. It was heard that similar items had been used for a series of burglaries by O'Brien between October and November last year, in which cash and jewellery were taken. The defendant claimed he was not the biker in question and, while he had used the motorbike gear for other crimes, he had not on that occasion. His account was rejected by jurors. In a victim impact statement Carroll, who believed the defendant had a gun, said he ""feared for his life""."

One Spanish person and another from the Dominican Republic were also detained. Agents from the UK's National Crime Agency assisted Spanish police in the sting, called Operation Tatum. Photos from the Civil Guard show a tattooed suspect being escorted away by officers, and batches of cocaine wrapped in film that had been stored in a shoebox.

The MP for Rotherham quit the frontbench after writing in The Sun that Britain ""has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls"". There has been a series of cases in towns including Rochdale, Oxford and Newcastle in which groups of men, largely of Pakistani origin, have been convicted of multiple sex crimes against white girls. Ms Champion's article led to a backlash from within Labour, while leader Jeremy Corbyn, an MP for Islington in north London, said his party would not ""blame"" or ""demonise any particular group"". But in an interview with The Times, Ms Champion said the reaction was largely provoked by a fear of being tagged racist. ""If I'm on the floppy left, to be accused of racism is probably the worst thing you can call me,"" she said. ""That fear will motivate me to step away from a lot of topics I'd maybe tackle head on if I didn't have that phobia."" Ms Champion added many London-based Labour members and politicians lived in a largely ""tolerant, multicultural world"", and had ""never been challenged by a reality that's different"". ""London is not representative of the UK and it's definitely not representative of the North of England in relation to race,"" she added. ""Rotherham and many post-industrial towns are still segregated."" When Ms Champion stood down, she apologised for the ""extremely poor choice of words in The Sun article"". Factually, however, she has insisted she was correct and said her position was ""not an opinion, although people would like it to be"". She added: ""It's based on the facts of this very specific form of grooming of girls by gangs of men. ""It's a very consistent model of recruitment, manipulation and exploitation, and when you look at the figures of the people who've been arrested and convicted, the vast, vast majority are British-Pakistani men."" In contrast to the reaction within her own party following her Sun article, Ms Champion says her email inbox ""went nuts with overwhelmingly positive messages"". ""Police, social workers, children's charities, health professionals were getting in touch and saying, 'Thank God you've said it; now maybe we can actually start dealing with this'. ""The relief they were expressing was extraordinary,"" she said. A spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Sexual abuse is an extremely serious crime that requires effective action to tackle it. ""To do so, we must focus on the perpetrators and how we can prevent grooming of women and girls. ""These heinous crimes are committed by people of all backgrounds. ""Stigmatising entire communities is wrong, and damages the interests of victims of sexual abuse and the rigorous investigation into the underlying causes of that abuse."""

The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said the impact of that increase on its members would be felt by motorists in the coming days. The RAC said petrol was on course to overtake diesel costs for the first time in a year with average prices likely rising above 121p per litre - its highest level since 2014 - with no end to the surge currently in sight. Diesel, it predicted, would remain stable at around 118.5p. A spokesman for the motoring organisation, Pete Williams, said: ""The price of unleaded petrol will leapfrog diesel early next week, rising by up to 4p per litre as the impact of Storm Harvey and the shut-down of large refineries in the Gulf Coast drives up US demand for petrol imports. :: House-to-house search for Storm Harvey victims He added: ""One quarter of the refining capacity in the States remains offline leaving a shortfall of over four million barrels a day, and crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is down 13.5%. ""In response, oil traders are acting to redirect fuel to the US ahead of the busy Labor Day weekend surge in travel."" The PRA said it had been told by Platts, the independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets, that ""there have been a large number of oil tankers set to move to the US from Europe carrying gasoline to make up shortfalls in the Gulf region"". PRA chairman Brian Madderson added: ""This will be bad for UK inflation, for cash strapped UK motorists and for the economy as money is diverted from other purchases""."

""There is no place for the type of conduct described in the allegations anywhere in G4S, "" said Jerry Petherick, managing director for custodial and detention services. ""Such behaviour is not representative of the many G4S colleagues who do a great job, often in difficult and challenging circumstances, across the country. ""Once we have seen the evidence and concluded the investigation, I will ensure that we take the appropriate action."" Concerns were raised in a recent inspection which revealed that the average length of detention had increased from 28 to 48 days, with four men held there for more than two years. The inspection also highlighted issues with the ""stark and impersonal"" residential units and unsatisfactory sanitary facilities, leading detainees to feel they were being held in prison. The director of the immigration removal centre, Ben Saunders, said: ""Inspectors rightly identify that the purpose-built design is stark in some places and work is already under way to address that, including improving the screening in bathroom areas. ""We will work closely with the Home Office, who own the buildings, to look at how we can further soften the environment, for example by making greater use of the art created by detainees, especially where it has achieved recognition from arts charities.""

Brook House was deemed ""reasonably good"" in all four healthy establishment tests - safety, respect, activities and preparation for removal or release.

The school's sixth form rules state that Year 12 pupils normally need three Bs or better to go on to Year 13. In June, the school's Year 12 tutors were told that pupils who under-performed and scored a C could not study that subject at A level. The two students were eventually allowed to return to St Olave's Grammar School in Orpington but only to study a BTEC in health and social care.

But he would not be drawn on an interview by his cabinet colleague Liam Fox, who on Friday morning accused EU officials of ""blackmailing"" Britain over the bill. Mr Davis said he would not comment on the views of other ministers, but said: ""We are in a difficult and tough, complicated negotiation. ""I have said from the beginning, it will be turbulent.

Asked how long the current Government would remain in power, and whether Mrs May would ""be able to write the final chapter in Brexit"", Mr Davis said it was ""my expectation"" that the Government would last five years, due to the Fixed Term Parliaments Act which made it difficult to have an early election. In fact, the Act was easily overridden by the Prime Minister to call the snap election in June, by calling a vote in the House of Commons. The Brexit Secretary did not mention Mrs May's stated plans, in interviews from Japan on Thursday, to fight the next election.

The speech to business leaders was a staunch defence of free trade - and in particular a UK-US trade deal - as the way to tackle the ""greatest social and economic challenges"" facing the world. In comments seen as a veiled warning to the Trump administration, he cautioned against a lurch towards protectionism and trade barriers as a response to the downsides of globalisation - a theme taken up by both Donald Trump and Mrs May. He said: ""My message is clear: the answer to these challenges is not to turn inwards and become isolationist. The answer to the economic problems of the West cannot be to turn our back on globalisation and trade - it's to lead the world forward once again."" But he conceded that while negotiations with the US on a trade deal could begin when Britain officially leaves the EU in March 2019, it could not be signed until Britain has agreed the terms of its future relationship with the bloc, which ministers concede could take another four year ""transition period"". In his speech, Mr Davis also tried to reassure a domestic and European audience that Britain would not engage in a ""regulatory race-to-the-bottom"" by slashing quality standards or wages, in order to compete with emerging economies such as China. The Brexit Secretary painted an optimistic picture of Britain's future outside the EU, and reiterated the Government's desire to agree trade and customs arrangements with the bloc which are as ""seamless and frictionless"" as possible. He said: ""There are many that doubt this is possible but when I spoke to my European counterpart Michel Barnier I said to him once: 'The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity, the optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty'. ""And as ever on that front I am a determined optimist in this - we will get to those opportunities. Because fundamentally I believe that a good deal is in the interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union and of the entire global community."" Mr Davis returned from the third round of exit talks in Brussels on Thursday, insisting at a terse news conference that ""some concrete progress"" had been made - only for Mr Barnier to retort that he thought there had been ""no decisive progress"" on the key issues of the divorce bill, the rights of EU citizens and the Northern Ireland border."

She later told a court how she had been held blindfolded in a makeshift ""coffin"" during the eight-day ordeal. During Sams' 1993 trial, Ms Slater described how she tried to befriend him so he would be less likely to harm her. She was freed after a £175,000 ransom was paid and her evidence later helped convict Sams of the 1991 murder of 18-year-old Julie Dart. After her kidnap, she worked with police to help them better deal with kidnap victims, and also with victims to help them get over their trauma. West Midlands Police have paid tribute to her work and for her ""courage and bravery over the years"". Speaking in 2011, Ms Slater said: ""Before this happened, I had a boyfriend, a job and a company car. I had loads of friends and a great social life. ""But he (Sams) took everything and destroyed the next 20 years of my life. ""But now I am ready to begin again. Most people begin their lives in their 20s or 30s but those years of my life were destroyed."" Her best friend, Stacey Ketner, said: ""We have had a unique and epic friendship for over 25 years and shared so much together, good and bad times. ""I know that she truly never got over the events that changed her life so dramatically in January 1992. It's been an honour and a privilege to be Stephanie's best friend."" Reporter Keith Wilkinson, a friend of Ms Slater's who made a documentary about her, said: ""The last time I saw her on the Isle of Wight to do some filming a few years ago, she was quite upbeat and positive. ""She could sometimes be hysterically funny and had many passions."" Killer Sams, now 76, was given a life sentence in 1993 for the murder and kidnap of Julie Dart and attempts to blackmail police."

One Spanish person and another from the Dominican Republic were also detained. Agents from the UK's National Crime Agency assisted Spanish police in the sting, called Operation Tatum. Photos from the Civil Guard show a tattooed suspect being escorted away by officers, and batches of cocaine wrapped in film that had been stored in a shoebox. Another image shows a bundle of €50 notes that was seized during a search. Operation Tatum was launched in connection with another drug raid last July, which saw four people arrested and 4.8kg of cocaine seized."

It measures in at almost three miles wide - the size of 30 Egyptian pyramids stuck together - and experts predict that this was the closest the asteroid will be to Earth until 2500. Astronomers at the Arecibo observatory in Puerto Rico have released a video of the fly-by, and NASA is using radar images to study the asteroid's real size. Named after Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, the asteroid was discovered in 1981. Although collisions with Earth are rare, an asteroid the size of a car hits the Earth's atmosphere about once a year. However, it burns up before reaching the surface. ""About every 2,000 years or so, a meteoroid the size of a football field hits Earth and causes significant damage to the area,"" NASA said. ""Finally, only once every few million years, an object large enough to threaten Earth's civilization comes along."" Thankfully, scientists are confident that Florence is not going to be one of them."

Earlier, Japan confirmed its near neighbour had conducted a sixth nuclear test. Japan's meteorological agency said the resulting tremors were at least 10 times as powerful as North Korea's previous nuclear test, last September. Experts estimated that blast to have been around 10 kilotons. It means this latest device was about five times larger than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki during World War II in August 1945. Japan's foreign minister, Taro Kono, described the new explosion as ""extremely unforgivable"". The Tokyo government has registered a protest with the North Korean embassy in Beijing, he said. Hours earlier, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke to President Trump on the phone about the ""escalating"" situation. The US Geological Survey said a magnitude 6.3 tremor struck North Korea's northeast, near its weapons test site. :: Key steps in North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions Sky News' Asia Correspondent, Katie Stallard, said: ""The significant point to take out of all of this is in terms of what response we see from the United States. ""We've seen over the last weeks and months increasing rhetoric from both sides, culminating memorably in Donald Trump's threat of ""fire and fury"" against Kim Jong Un's regime if they continued to make threats. ""So the question is, given his previous rhetoric, his previous threats, how Donald Trump plans to respond to this."" Seoul based journalist Alex Jensen told Sky News: ""We recently heard Donald Trump saying that all options are on the table… presumably they are still on the table. ""I think the US is going to be furious about this."" He continued: ""It's ridiculous that Trump was saying only a few days ago that there was restraint in North Korea… when there was really no indication of the sort. ""I'm pretty sure you're going to see a lot of US hardware in this direction in the next few hours. Possibly it'll be a fly by and how is North Korea going to respond to that?"" It comes just hours after Pyongyang claimed to have developed a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded into a long-range missile. The state-run Korean Central News Agency released pictures of Kim Jong Un visiting the country's Nuclear Weapons Institute in Pyongyang. Dressed in a black suit and flanked by his lieutenants, the Supreme Leader was seen examining a metal casing with two bulges that was apparently the purported weapon. State media quoted Mr Kim as saying it was a ""thermonuclear weapon with super explosive power"" and ""all components of the H-bomb were 100% domestically made"". It claimed the hydrogen bomb's power is adjustable to hundreds of kilotons and can be detonated at high altitudes. Experts are sceptical about the claim that Pyongyang has mastered hydrogen technology, but it is almost impossible to independently confirm statements about its highly secret weapons programme. Melissa Hanham, of the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in California, said the images released by the North could not be proved real. ""We don't know if this thing is full of styrofoam, but yes, it is shaped like it has two devices,"" she said on Twitter. ""It doesn't need to be shaped like that on the outside, but they threw in a diagram, just so we would get the message. ""The bottom line is that they probably are going to do a thermonuclear test in the future. We won't know if it's this object though."" :: North Korea threat: What does Kim Jong Un really want? The developments are raising already high tensions on the Korean Peninsula and in Washington that the North is getting closer to its goal of an arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that can reach the US mainland. Last month, US media reported that US intelligence officials had concluded Pyongyang had successfully miniaturised a nuclear weapon. It prompted President Donald Trump to issue a warning of ""fire and fury"" on the North, while Pyongyang threatened to fire missiles towards the US territory of Guam. On Tuesday, the North fired a mid-range ballistic missile that flew over Japan - a test considered one of the most provocative ever from the reclusive state."

But those who look after the black-and-white cat, named after former foreign secretary and two-time prime minister Viscount Palmerston, have no doubt that number is an underestimate. The recorded figures only include officially documented sightings and so is likely to be far higher. Palmerston arrived from Whitehall from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in 2016. He lives in the shadow of Larry - but while the tabby and white feline is often seen leisurely strolling along Downing Street, basking in the spotlight, Palmerston has been at his most lethal.

The FCO said it ""does not keep an accurate figure for the amount of mice caught by Palmerston. ""The PUS's (Permanent Under-Secretary, Sir Simon McDonald) office do receive reported sightings of Palmerston catching mice - so far (since Palmerston's arrival in April 2016) this figure is at 27.

The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said the impact of that increase on its members would be felt by motorists in the coming days. The RAC said petrol was on course to overtake diesel costs for the first time in a year with average prices likely rising above 121p per litre - its highest level since 2014 - with no end to the surge currently in sight. Diesel, it predicted, would remain stable at around 118.5p. A spokesman for the motoring organisation, Pete Williams, said: ""The price of unleaded petrol will leapfrog diesel early next week, rising by up to 4p per litre as the impact of Storm Harvey and the shut-down of large refineries in the Gulf Coast drives up US demand for petrol imports. :: House-to-house search for Storm Harvey victims He added: ""One quarter of the refining capacity in the States remains offline leaving a shortfall of over four million barrels a day, and crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is down 13.5%.

He was admitted to hospital last month after his health was said to have taken a ""defining turn"" during a cancer battle. Cardinal Cormac was ordained as a priest in Rome in 1956 at the age of 24, with Pope John Paul II appointing him a cardinal in 2001, a year after he took the role of Archbishop of Westminster. His replacement, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, described how Cardinal Cormac died ""peacefully"" at 3.15pm on Friday. He was surrounded by family and friends. In a statement, Cardinal Nichols, the current Archbishop of Westminster, added: ""Please pray for the repose of his soul. ""Pray, too, for his family, and those many friends and colleagues from the Diocese and far beyond who mourn his loss."" In a message posted on the church's website on Friday afternoon, Cardinal Cormac had asked Cardinal Vincent to relay how he was ""at peace"" and had ""no fear of what is to come"". Describing how he was ""privileged"" to have served as Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac added: ""I have received many blessings in my life, especially from my family and friends. ""I thank God for the many priests, religious and lay faithful who have helped and sustained me in my Episcopal life. ""Nor should I forget the many Anglican and Free Church colleagues whose friendship I have valued very much. ""Above all, as I now commend myself to the loving mercy of God, I ask them all to pray for me as I remember and pray for them."" Early into his tenure as Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac set up an investigation into child sex abuse in the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Following his retirement, he was later appointed by the Vatican to take a leading role in a probe into abuse in the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland. In 2015, Cardinal Cormac admitted he was ashamed of how he dealt with sex abuse allegations concerning a Catholic priest within his Sussex diocese in the 1980s, which he did not report to police. The priest, Michael Hill, went on to abuse more children and was jailed in 1997. His time as Archbishop of Westminster was also marked by a row with Tony Blair's Labour government over the rights of gay couples to adopt children. Cardinal Cormac had argued Catholic adoption agencies should be exempt from new laws, but later welcomed Mr Blair into the Catholic Church when the former prime minister converted after leaving office. Mr Blair and his wife Cherie, also a Catholic, paid tribute to Cardinal Cormac as ""a wonderful advertisement for Christianity and the Catholic Church"". They said in a statement: ""He led a life of commitment, dedication and compassion. But he also led a life of joy. ""He was a lovely person to be with and be around with a great sense of humour and the sharpest of wits. ""I found him always a source of wisdom and genuine friendship. We will miss him greatly and give thanks for his life."" In 2001, Cardinal Cormac became the first Catholic Cardinal to take part in an English royal funeral service since 1509 when he read prayers at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Anglican Church, said ""people saw something of Christ"" in Cardinal Cormac. ""The news of the death of Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor today represents a loss to his innumerable friends, to the church and to the country,"" he said. ""Cormac was a bishop for four decades but was first and foremost a servant of God and disciple of Jesus Christ. ""His humility, sense and holiness made him a church leader of immense impact."""

Both pupils, who failed to achieve a required B or above in any of their subjects taken in the first year of sixth form, have now been told by the school they will be allowed to return. The Department for Education said: ""All schools have a responsibility to provide a high quality education to every pupil and ensure there is no limit to their potential.

The MP for Rotherham quit the frontbench after writing in The Sun that Britain ""has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls"". There has been a series of cases in towns including Rochdale, Oxford and Newcastle in which groups of men, largely of Pakistani origin, have been convicted of multiple sex crimes against white girls. Ms Champion's article led to a backlash from within Labour, while leader Jeremy Corbyn, an MP for Islington in north London, said his party would not ""blame"" or ""demonise any particular group"". But in an interview with The Times, Ms Champion said the reaction was largely provoked by a fear of being tagged racist. ""If I'm on the floppy left, to be accused of racism is probably the worst thing you can call me,"" she said. ""That fear will motivate me to step away from a lot of topics I'd maybe tackle head on if I didn't have that phobia."" Ms Champion added many London-based Labour members and politicians lived in a largely ""tolerant, multicultural world"", and had ""never been challenged by a reality that's different"". ""London is not representative of the UK and it's definitely not representative of the North of England in relation to race,"" she added. ""Rotherham and many post-industrial towns are still segregated."" When Ms Champion stood down, she apologised for the ""extremely poor choice of words in The Sun article"". Factually, however, she has insisted she was correct and said her position was ""not an opinion, although people would like it to be"". She added: ""It's based on the facts of this very specific form of grooming of girls by gangs of men. ""It's a very consistent model of recruitment, manipulation and exploitation, and when you look at the figures of the people who've been arrested and convicted, the vast, vast majority are British-Pakistani men."" In contrast to the reaction within her own party following her Sun article, Ms Champion says her email inbox ""went nuts with overwhelmingly positive messages"". ""Police, social workers, children's charities, health professionals were getting in touch and saying, 'Thank God you've said it; now maybe we can actually start dealing with this'. ""The relief they were expressing was extraordinary,"" she said. A spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Sexual abuse is an extremely serious crime that requires effective action to tackle it. ""To do so, we must focus on the perpetrators and how we can prevent grooming of women and girls. ""These heinous crimes are committed by people of all backgrounds.

He visited Houston, the state's biggest city, before making his way to Lake Charles in neighbouring Louisiana. Both have seen mass evacuations because of the historic flooding. Mr Trump's first stop was a shelter, where he visited a section reserved for child survivors and listened to their stories. He spoke of seeing ""a lot of love"" and ""a lot of happiness"" after high-fiving one boy and picking up a girl to give her a kiss. The Trumps later handed out hot dogs in white boxes bearing the Red Cross logo, pausing frequently to greet and take selfies with enthusiastic aid recipients. They then moved on to a church in Pearland, where Mr Trump praised officials' ""terrific"" rescue effort. He told volunteers handing out food and hygiene products: ""I don't know if it gets better, but we're going to try to make it better."" Mr Trump was criticised after his first visit for not meeting those directly affected by the storm, which has so far killed 50 people and left one million displaced. But the White House said he did not want to get in the way of the relief effort. Sky's US Correspondent Cordelia Lynch, reporting from the Houston neighbourhood of Westchester, said: ""People are dealing with rising floodwaters, despite the fact that the water is receding in other areas. ""That's because there has been a controlled release of water from reservoirs. ""We're going from home to home with residents, trying to negotiate quite perilous waters, so people can salvage what's in their homes."" The President has asked Congress for an initial $7.85bn (£6.1bn) in disaster relief in the wake of the storm. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the request is a ""downpayment on the President's commitment to help affected states recover from the storm"". Further funding requests are expected to address longer-term rebuilding needs as the full impact of the storm becomes clear. Harvey was the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in half a century - dumping unprecedented amounts of rain across more than 300 miles (480km) of the state's coast."

A similar device was found in the Ballyarnett area of Derry in October 2014, police say. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) detective superintendent John McVea said the method of detonation, while not sophisticated, was ""very effective"". ""The New IRA have access to high explosives - which is concerning,"" he said. The bomb itself consists of a box of explosives wrapped in tape and placed under a car. The pressure plate detonator is activated when a car wheel drives over it. In the past, dissident Republicans have used magnetic under-car bombs, but that has become difficult because modern cars use plastic, Mr McVea said. Police are on high alert for more attacks from the New IRA, which is opposed to the peace process and was formed in 2012. The group, which gathers several dissident republican organisations, is believed to be the largest of its kind and has been linked to a number of attacks on police. Mr McVea said that in the February incident the plate detonator used to target the vehicle had failed to explode. It was discovered hours later on the driveway of the officer's home and exploded while it was being examined. The other known case in which the method was used was in Ballyarnett village in 2014 when a pressure plate was left under a mat with the intention of luring officers to stand on it. ""We believe the New IRA is responsible for both attacks. I can also confirm that the same type of pressure plate device was used on both occasions,"" said Detective Superintendent McVea. Police want anyone with any information on either of the two incidents to contact the incident room on 02871379793, or via 101, or alternatively call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

Professional footballers past and present also took part, including David Seaman, Peter Crouch, David James, Shay Given, Trevor Sinclair and Jamie Redknapp, as well as Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah and McFly singer Danny Jones. They were split into two teams: one headed by former QPR and England striker Les Ferdinand, and the other coached by former England captain Alan Shearer. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho joined Team Shearer as goalkeeper midway through the second half. The stadium fell silent before the game began in memory of the 80 people who lost their lives in the devastating blaze on 14 June. Game4Grenfell was the brainchild of Ferdinand, who grew up on the Lancaster West Estate beside the 24-storey tower. Just two minutes into the game, Sir Mo scored the first goal for Team Ferdinand, as the athlete celebrated by performing his trademark 'Mobot' along with his teammates. The match finished 2-2 after 90 minutes and then went to penalties. Team Ferdinand eventually triumphed 5-3, with Murs scoring the winning penalty past Mourinho. Loftus Road is just a mile away from Grenfell Tower, and money raised from the charity game is going to the Evening Standard's fund for those hit by the tragedy. More than 14,000 tickets were sold, with a further 3,000 given to survivors, residents, volunteers and the emergency services. For one family in particular, the football game was a much-needed opportunity to escape the heartache they've experienced since the Grenfell fire. Earlier this week, Karim Mussilhy and his family received confirmation that their Uncle Hesham Rahman, 57, had been formally identified as someone who died. Paying tribute to his uncle, Mr Mussilhy said: ""Hesham was very loving, kind and generous. He loved children and was a huge part of our family. ""He lived on the top floor of the tower and had diabetes so would have struggled to get down the stairs. We last spoke to him at 3am when he said he had been told to stay inside and someone was coming for him. ""We know that on the night of the fire he went to one of his neighbours who had young children and we have heard video of him comforting them while their mother was upset. ""He was calm, trying to make people less scared and frightened, keeping the peace. That says a lot about who he was. That's how I want him to be remembered, as a hero."" Mr Mussilhy's nine-year-old son, Kai, was a mascot for the game. ""Kai hasn't stopped talking about it since he found out he was a mascot,"" he added.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the possible causes for the chemical cloud include discharges from a vessel, previously unreported lost cargo, and emissions from known shipwrecks. In a statement, it said: ""We have identified approximately 180 vessels that passed through the English Channel off the coast of Eastbourne on Sunday 27 August. ""We are working with all relevant Environmental and Public Health regulators to conclude these investigations."" Initially, it was believed the haze may have been caused by chemicals drifting over the English Channel. However, the Met Office said weather models indicated it was unlikely the haze came from northern France. Irritation was first reported by tourists visiting the clifftops and beach at Birling Gap near Eastbourne just before 5pm on Sunday. Some said they could smell chlorine, but the fire service said it was ""extremely unlikely"" to have been the chemical. The effects of the haze were reported as far as Bexhill and towards Hastings, more than 20 miles away. Patients were given full decontamination treatment as a precaution but police said it was soon clear that this was unnecessary. People were advised to wash all over with soap and water. Mark Battershill, who was one of those affected, told Sky News he was left with stinging eyes and a sore throat after coming into contact with the mystery chemical. He said some people had complained that they were having difficulty breathing."

Last week, Sinn Fein rejected Democratic Union Party leader Arlene Foster's proposal to resume power-sharing and address differences over culture and language in a parallel process. Civil servants have been running Northern Ireland for six months but with no agreed budget and no ministers in office, health and education are in crisis. At St. Patrick's High School in Keady, County Armagh, they fear the political stalemate will have long-term consequences for education. Principal Pat McGuckian explained: ""In the last five years, we've made 10 redundancies in terms of teaching staff. ""This year, we've had to make support staff redundant. While making teaching staff redundant increases class sizes and puts more pressure on teachers, making support staff redundant is going to impact on the most vulnerable in our school. ""They're going to fall off the end educationally because there's no one to help them and keep them in school."" The devolved government had agreed a plan to reduce waiting lists in the health service - but with no health minister in office to implement it, doctors say lives could be lost. Dr Grainne Doran, who chairs the Royal College of GPs in Northern Ireland, explained: ""The difficulty with elective care is that if your waiting time for that becomes excessively long, change can happen. ""That's one of the pressures that we as GPs are under, that we need to keep an eye on and monitor those patients. If there is a failure to escalate if change does occur, then that can in theory put lives at risk."" :: Irish border: Will Brexit undermine unionism?:: UK could replace EU peace funding for NI - May The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein had been sharing power for almost 10 years when devolution collapsed in January over a botched renewable energy scheme costing hundreds of millions of pounds. Ironically, Northern Ireland's political parties now have an extra £1.5bn to spend - the price Theresa May paid for the DUP's support in the Commons. But without a devolved government, it could be direct rule ministers from London and not local ministers who decide how that cash is spent."

2017-09-03,The Queensferry Crossing has joined the list of engineering feats spanning the UK's rivers and gorges. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170903211719/http://news.sky.com/story/crossing-the-divide-five-facts-about-uk-bridges-11017360,"After tens of thousands of people enjoyed a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity to cross the new Forth structure on foot, here's a look at other British bridges with a claim to fame. :: Longest This is a tricky category because it depends how you quantify the bridge's length. Is it the full span, or is it the distance from one side of a river, valley or gorge to the other? It isn't the most glamorous, but technically the Bromford Viaduct - spanning three-and-a-half miles over Spaghetti Junction between Castle Bromwich and Gravelly Hill in Birmingham - is the longest. It was built between 1964 and 1972. :: Oldest Another difficult one to confirm, but the oldest standing bridge could well be the Tarr Steps - a ""clapper bridge"" between Withypool and Dulverton in Somerset. The Grade I listed building, built in medieval times, is formed of massive stones and spans 55m (180ft) across the River Barle in Exmoor National Park. Owing to flood damage, the ancient structure has had to be repaired. Legend claims the devil built the bridge so he could sunbathe on its stones. :: Tallest Costing £1.35bn, the newly-opened Queensferry Crossing reaches 207m (679ft) above the Firth of Forth - that's the equivalent of 48 London buses stacked on top of each other. Carrying the M90 between Edinburgh and Fife, the cable-stayed bridge is the third to cross the water and was finally opened to traffic on 30 August after almost six years of construction. As it was built, remnants of a Mesolithic dwelling were discovered on the south bank of the Forth dating back to around 8300 BC - the earliest known dwelling in Scotland. :: Most famous The star of blockbuster movies, Tower Bridge is one of the most recognisable features in the capital. Opened in 1894, some 40,000 people cross the bridge every day. Patriotic red, white and blue paint was added in 1977 as part of the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations. You can even watch the bridge live 24 hours a day on a HD webcam. :: And finally... London Bridge, the one in the nursery rhyme and a poem by T.S. Eliot, wins the award for the most travelled UK bridge. The previous crossing was dismantled in 1967 and relocated more than 5,000 miles away to Lake Havasu City in Arizona. Exterior granite blocks from the 1830s bridge now clad London Bridge in the US city, which was completed in 1971. The current crossing in the UK capital was completed in 1973 and now carries the A3 over the River Thames."

Soldiers and armed residents have been accused of carrying out a killing spree against Rohingya Muslim men, women, and children in Chut Pyin village, leaving more than 200 dead. They have also set fire to ""numerous"" villages throughout northern Rakhine state in the last week, displacing tens of thousands, according to Bangkok-based watchdog Fortify Rights. About 58,600 Rohingya civilians have left Myanmar, also known as Burma, and fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. Some have drowned while trying to make the journey. Mr Johnson has expressed hope that Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, will be able to use ""all her remarkable qualities to unite her country, to stop the violence and to end the prejudice that afflicts both Muslims and other communities in Rakhine"". In a statement, he said: ""Aung Sang Suu Kyi is rightly regarded as one of the most inspiring figures of our age but the treatment of the Rohingya is alas besmirching the reputation of Burma. ""She faces huge challenges in modernising her country... It is vital that she receives the support of the Burmese military, and that her attempts at peacemaking are not frustrated. ""She and all in Burma will have our full support in this."" The Buddhist-majority government has blamed militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) for burning down the homes, and also accused them of killing Buddhists. Fortify Rights reported villagers armed with swords and knives hacked and beheaded Rohingya residents, including children, in Chut Pyin. Soldiers reportedly arrested a large group of Rohingya men, marched them into a nearby bamboo hut and set it on fire, burning them to death. A 41-year-old man called Abdul Rahman, who claimed he survived the attack, said his two young nephews had been beheaded. He told Fortify Rights: ""My brother was killed. (Soldiers) burned him with the group. We found (my other family members) in the fields. ""They had marks on their bodies from bullets and some had cuts. My two nephews, their heads were off. One was six years old and the other was nine years old. My sister-in-law was shot with a gun."" According to Fortify Rights, survivors from two other villages - Kyet Yoe Pyin and Ba Da Kha Ywa Thit - also described beheadings and throats being cut. Residents from many other villages described arson attacks and soldiers opening fire on fleeing civilians, including children, the watchdog added. The latest violence erupted over a week ago when the rebels attacked remote police posts, killing 15 officials. The ARSA, who say they are defending the Rohingya from persecution by Myanmar, claimed responsibility for the security post assaults that sparked a large army counteroffensive. The escalation in fighting has seen about 400 people killed in recent days and more than 2,600 houses burnt down. The treatment of the 1.1 million Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is accused by Western critics of not speaking out for a minority that has long complained of persecution. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Myanmar of ""genocide"" against the Rohingya, while UN chief Antonio Guterres has warned of a looming humanitarian catastrophe in western Myanmar."

This year members of the public will visit 20 different sites as part of the Big Bottle Count and the #OneLess campaign working to cut the amount of ocean pollution. The number of volunteers has risen in recent years with 100 people trained up by charity Thames21 annually. The charity says their citizen scientists are ""the last line of defence in the battle against the plastic tide, and stopping it from reaching the sea"". Chris Coode, deputy chief executive of Thames21, told Sky News volunteer involvement is hugely significant. ""They have local knowledge and they know their local site really well… if we have a good network of citizen scientists we can build up a huge picture of data. ""We can have many more people capturing much more data than you could have with a paid scientist. ""…this is the key thing with citizen science if you can support them properly and create a method that is scientifically robust, so the data you are collecting actual scientists can use, then you can pass that information onto scientists who can analyse it. ""Then you're actually capturing a lot more data than you would otherwise be able to do through conventional science means. ""Also your citizen scientists become ambassadors for the cause."" The Big Bottle Count aims to remove plastic from the Thames but also to investigate where the bottles are coming from, where they are ending up and how their entry into the river can be stopped. The #OneLess campaign is ""working to create a refill revolution in London, creating a culture where using a refillable water bottle is the norm"". According to Thames21 the average adult in London buys 175 bottles of water a year. The campaign and project coincides with an art installation tour of the banks of the river which showcases plastic retrieved from the Thames over a one-year period. Artist Maria Arceo decided to do the project when she found a pair of sandals on the side of the river which are believed to be 100 years old. Maria says she began questioning how long plastic would be in our oceans if leather could last a century in water. The installation is called Future Dust and is in the shape of a giant footprint. ""This is only a fraction of what is out there,"" she said. ""If you can multiply what I find if I just do one beach each day all over the Thames then what I pick up in one beach will be multiplied by all those other beaches. ""…and compared to all rivers around the world in comparison this is a clean river so I want people to realise just because it looks clean it doesn't mean it is. We need to change the way we behave."" :: You can find out more about Sky Ocean Rescue and get involved by visiting the campaign's website."
2017-09-03,I'll admit I was rather shocked by Theresa May's answer to my question over whether she wanted to fight the next general election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170903211719/http://news.sky.com/story/pm-had-little-choice-but-to-say-yes-to-another-election-11013977,"She responded with a straight ""yes"". Firstly, she'd not said it before; secondly, it was an unequivocal answer to a direct question by a Prime Minister who often avoids and deflects with planned soundbites, not always relevant to the enquiry. :: PM: I'm no quitter and will fight 2022 election Then I was left wondering, what choice did she have? At some point the Prime Minister had to put this question to bed. With reports, perhaps 'fake news', suggesting she'd set a date to resign - it was time to take a position. If she'd confirmed she was making a mid-term exit, after Brexit, that would have fired the gun for a two-year leadership race, immediately undermining her authority. So if she does eventually quit then, like her disastrous election, it has to be a snap decision. It could, however, also be the political determination of a woman described by Ken Clarke as ""bloody difficult"" and who has chosen to be bloody difficult to remove. After all, she's waited long enough for the job - and a lot can be learned from her opposition leader about blanking out the negative voices. She will have to do that today. Former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, former party chair Grant Shapps and Tory grandee Michael Heseltine all expressed surprise at her determination to go on. The critics tend to come from the Remain camp and supporters from the Eurosceptic side of the party. Those vocally supporting Mrs May include John Redwood, Boris Johnson and Peter Bone, who says she will ""emerge a national hero"" if she delivers Brexit. On that subject, the Japan trip is having mixed results. Mrs May appears to have a reassurance from her counterpart Shinzo Abe that he will work toward a free-trade deal with the UK based on the EU deal once that has been has been concluded. He also made positive sounds about continued investment in the UK after Brexit - but made clear that Japanese companies saw the UK as a ""gateway to the EU"" and they would be would be ""watching carefully"" how the UK approaches Brexit. Mr Abe's main concern seemed to be ""minimising the impact of Brexit"". He asked Mrs May for ""transparency and predictability"" during her EU exit negotiation. It's clear the Japanese PM sees Brexit as a damage limitation exercise - and as it happens that is what's going on in the Conservative Party right now following Mrs May disastrous snap election. Big questions remain over whether that includes restructuring at the top."

He said the idea put forward by the EU's chief negotiator last week that no progress had been made was ""silly"", pointing to the agreement reached on continuing access to the European Health Insurance Card for UK citizens living in the EU as his evidence. He poured scorn too on Michel Barnier's warning that time was running out as being nothing more than a negotiating tactic to strong arm the UK into agreeing to a large Brexit divorce bill. The suggestion there is that the EU were ""trying to play time against money"" - a pressure to which he vowed not to succumb. :: EU playing 'time against money' in Brexit talks And he dismissed as ""nonsense"" reports in the Sunday Times that the Government had secretly resolved to agree to a £50bn divorce settlement with the EU, to be announced after the upcoming party conference season. But turning to the upcoming second reading of the EU Withdrawal Bill (previously known as the Great Repeal Bill), Mr Davis implied the clock was very much ticking and there was no time for messing around. Labour has said that it will not support the Bill in its current form over concerns about so-called ""Henry VIII Clauses"", which would give Ministers powers to pass legislation with limited parliamentary scrutiny. There are suggestions a number of Conservative MPs who had supported Remain are considering backing amendments Labour plan to put forward, something which could prolong, or ultimately derail the Bill's progress. There simply is not time for that, according to Mr Davis, who said the swift passage of the Bill through Parliament was a practical necessity, even for those who want a ""soft brexit"". The Bill he claimed was the only way to ensure existing laws deriving from the EU are in place in domestic UK law the day after Brexit, avoiding the much-feared ""cliff edge"". Concerns that Ministers would sneak laws through out of sight of MPs, he said, were not credible, and that ""everything significant"" would be dealt with in the conventional parliamentary manner. But it seems his opposite number, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Kier Starmer, is adopting a similar strategy to that employed by Mr Davis himself in Brussels - a refusal to be forced into an agreement by the threat of time pressure. Mr Starmer said his party would not give the government a ""blank cheque"" on issues that would have such long-lasting impact, and that Labour's concerns must be addressed if the party is to support the bill. Indeed, according to Mr Starmer, the time pressures are of the Government's own making because things are ""going so slowly in negotiations"". That lack of progress, he says, is precisely why Labour believes the UK must remain a member of the single market and the customs union for a ""transitional period"" after it leaves the EU. When pushed on how long he believed that period may last, Mr Starmer said it should be as short as possible but acknowledged it could go on more than three years, which would take it through to the next scheduled General Election."

Soaking up some sunset time in the cupola… pic.twitter.com/AiReQzkjJZ While on the ISS, about 250 miles above Earth, the biochemist spent much of her time on experiments, including studies of cancerous lung tissue and bone cells. She said that, apart from the last week, her time in space flew by but that she missed pizza and her husband, fellow biochemist Clarence Sams. She also looked forward to using a regular flushing toilet again, she added. Soaring during our last spacewalk, going outside again tomorrow! Amazing being part of this great team keeping @Space_Station strong. pic.twitter.com/Me8ODm434K Ms Whitson, 57, has set a number of records with this mission - she is the oldest spacewoman and the most experienced spacewalker, with 10 spacewalks, including four on this mission. In an interview on Monday, she had described the work as ""one of the most gratifying jobs I've ever had"". She told Reuters: ""I am working on paying forward some of the advice and mentoring that I received on my journey in hopes that one day those young people will do the same and look back on a life in which they leapt at the opportunities and broke their own records."" She landed with crewmates Jack Fischer of NASA and Fyodor Yurchikhin of Russian space agency Roscosmos just before 2.30am UK time. All three appeared well as they were tended to by a greeting party on Earth before being carried in chairs to a medical tent. Mr Yurchikhin has logged 673 days in space over five missions and Mr Fischer has done 136 days. They both flew to the ISS in April.

2017-09-04,"Nicola Sturgeon will commit her government to the introduction of a deposit return scheme, Sky News understands.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170904220851/http://news.sky.com/story/plans-to-cut-plastic-waste-revealed-11020881,"The initiative, which aims to cut single use plastic waste, is partly prompted by Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign. It will apply to plastic and glass bottles, as well as aluminium cans. The Scottish government had already commissioned a detailed study into a deposit return scheme (DRS) and Sky News understands its ministers have been following Sky's campaign closely, with concerns raised in its coverage fed into their decision-making. Scottish ministers will now look at what DRS will work best, balancing the interests of the environment with the concerns of those opposed to such a scheme. :: Why plastic bottle return scheme is a big deal Coca-Cola reversed its opposition to a scheme in Scotland after Sky News exposed its strategy to ""fightback"" against it. However, other drinks companies remain opposed to a DRS. Barr's, the makers of Irn-Bru, have said that it could be subject to fraud and create the possibility of cross-border trafficking of ""deposit-bearing containers"". Catherine Gemmell, of the Marine Conservation Society, described plans for a DRS as an ""absolutely fantastic idea"". She said: ""Unfortunately, over the last few years, we have seen a big increase across our beaches on bottles, on cans and on glass as well. ""This is why we think a deposit return system will have a huge impact on decreasing the amount that we're finding on our beaches. ""We had a huge success a couple of years ago with the 5p carrier bag charge - after that was put in place, we saw a 40% decrease in bags on our beaches, so we think deposit return is definitely the next best thing."" John Mayhew, of the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland, also welcomed the commitment. He said: ""That's a really great move for Scotland and I'd also like to say how much we appreciate the support we've had from Sky News over the last year. ""We know that it will reduce litter, tackle climate change, it'll boost our recycling rates in Scotland, it'll save money for local authorities and it'll produce better materials that we can use in our recycling industry."""

As well as demanding more secure working patterns, the striking workers also want to be paid a wage of at least £10 an hour. The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) said the decision was taken after McDonald's missed ""countless opportunities to resolve grievances"". Ian Hodson, the union's national president, added: ""We fully support the historic decision by these brave workers to stand up and fight back against McDonald's - a company that has let them down one too many times. This is a call for change. ""For far too long, workers in fast food restaurants such as McDonald's have had to deal with poor working conditions, drastic cuts to employee hours, and even bullying in the workplace - viewed by many as punishment for joining a union."" Members of other trade unions also also joined picket lines outside the two restaurants. McDonald's employs approximately 85,000 staff in the UK and one million worldwide. In April, the company announced its workers would be offered a choice of flexible or fixed contracts with minimum guaranteed hours - but claims 86% wanted to stick with a flexible arrangement. A McDonald's spokesman added: ""The BFAWU has indicated that a small number of our people representing less than 0.01% of our workforce are intending to strike in two of our 1,270 UK restaurants. ""As per the terms of the ballot, the dispute is solely related to our internal grievance procedures and not concerning pay or contracts."" McDonald's claims that three pay rises have been delivered to staff since April 2016, increasing the average hourly rate by 15%. Later, the 40 striking workers will attend a rally in Westminster, with Jeremy Corbyn offering his support. Applauding them for ""making history"", the Labour leader said: ""They are standing up for workers' rights by leading the first-ever strike at McDonald's in the UK. ""Their demands are just and should be met."" Caroline Russell, Green Party assembly member for London, said: ""Despite what McDonald's might like you to think, it's clear their workers are not in fact 'lovin' it'. ""The anxiety their informal contracts has created, the pressure they are under to find additional jobs to support their income, and the embarrassment they feel when they cannot pay for the basic things for their family, has pushed them to the brink."""

2017-09-04,"Culture Secretary Karen Bradley has received the latest guidance from Ofcom, the media regulator, on the proposed takeover of Sky plc, the owner of Sky News, by US entertainment giant 21st Century Fox, the Department for Culture, Media & Sport said today.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170904220851/http://news.sky.com/story/bradley-to-rule-on-fox-takeover-of-sky-soon-dcms-11020363,"Ofcom carried out an assessment of the £18.5bn takeover at the request of Ms Bradley earlier this year. It investigated whether a takeover would reduce the plurality of media ownership in the UK and whether Fox, the world's fourth largest media company, could be relied on to adhere to UK broadcasting standards. Separately, Ofcom was also asked to examine whether the directors of 21st Century Fox were 'fit and proper' to hold a UK broadcasting licence. The regulator said at the end of June that there was no reason to block the takeover on the 'fit and proper' test and, after receiving certain undertakings from Fox, said there were no grounds for blocking it on the grounds of either plurality or broadcasting standards. However, following complaints from a number of MPs, including the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Ms Bradley last month asked Ofcom to go over the evidence again. She has previously said she was ""minded"" to refer the proposed takeover to the Competition & Markets Authority for a more detailed investigation that could take up to six months. The DCMS said today: ""We have today received Ofcom's response and the Secretary of State will now carefully consider the advice before making her decision on the referral on the basis of all the evidence before her, as soon as is reasonably practicable."" It said this would be made public ""in due course"". Sky has previously criticised the delays caused by the way the referral process is being dragged out, arguing: ""Businesses require a level of certainty in order to plan and invest."" Fox, which already owns a 39.1% stake in Sky, announced in December last year that it planned to buy the remaining shares in Sky that it does not already own. The likelihood of a referral to the CMA means it has put back the date by when it expects to complete the takeover to the end of June next year. All of the other countries in which Sky operates - Germany, Austria, Italy and the Republic of Ireland - have already given the takeover the green light, while the European Commission has also said there are no grounds on which to block the proposed takeover."

Prince Charles As the firstborn son of Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Cornwall is first in line for the throne. Born on 14 November 1948, Prince Charles has been the heir apparent since his mother's accession to the throne four years later. Prince William The Duke of Cambridge is second in line to the throne after his father, with his children behind him in the order of succession. After two years as an air ambulance pilot, William is now carrying out his royal duties on a full-time basis from Kensington Palace. Prince George The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child pushed his uncle, Prince Harry, down the line of succession when he was born in July 2013. This week, the four-year-old will start his first academic year at independent school Thomas's Battersea. Princess Charlotte Just over a year after the birth of Prince George, Kensington Palace announced that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were expecting a second child. Born on 2 May 2015, Princess Charlotte was the first royal to be subject to changes to the Royal Marriages Act, which gives girls and boys equal right to the throne. For Charlotte, it means that she will stay fourth in line to the throne even if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge welcome a second son in 2018. Prince Harry Until the arrival of William and Kate's third child, Prince Harry will remain fifth in line to the throne. Earlier this year, Prince Charles and Princess Diana's youngest son suggested that no one in the Royal Family wants to take over from the Queen but said ""we will carry out our duties at the right time"". Prince Andrew The Duke of York was the first child born to a reigning monarch since the birth of Queen Victoria's youngest child, Princess Beatrice, in 1857. He was born second in line to the throne, but was been pushed down to sixth after the birth of Prince Charles' sons and grandchildren.  Princess Beatrice The eldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York is now the second highest ranking female in the line of succession, following the birth of Princess Charlotte. The 29-year-old business consultant is involved with a number of charities. Princess Eugenie The 27-year-old is the Queen's sixth grandchild and eighth in line to the throne. In 2013, she moved to New York City to work for an online auction firm but has since moved back to London to work for Hauser & Wirth art gallery as an associate director. Prince Edward The Queen and Prince Philip's youngest son was born as the third in line to the throne. He has since fallen to ninth, and will drop a place lower after the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall's third child. James, Viscount Severn Though he is four years younger than his sister, Lady Louise Windsor, James is one place higher in the order of succession to the throne. The son of Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, will drop to 11th in line after the birth of William and Kate's next child. Lady Louise Windsor The Earl and Countess of Sussex's daughter, currently 11th in line to the throne, was born four weeks premature in November 2003. During her birth, the Countess suffered a placental abruption, a potentially life-threatening condition which caused her to lose several pints of blood. Lady Louise's life was also in danger and she was transferred to a hospital in London. Princess Anne Due the primacy boys previously had under the Royal Marriages Act, the Queen and Prince Philip's only daughter is 12th in line for the throne. The Princess Royal is known for her charity work and an equestrian career which saw her compete in the 1976 Montreal Olympics."

In her latest appearance, dressed in pink, she announced that North Korea had tested a hydrogen bomb, thought to be five times more powerful than the device dropped on Nagasaki during the Second World War. But who is the woman whose words send diplomatic tremors across the globe? Now 74, Ri Chun Hee is said to have been born to a poor family in Tongchon county in 1943. She studied performance art at Pyongyang University of Theatre and Film, first appearing on state broadcaster KCTV in 1971. By 1974, she was the station's chief news presenter, and handled the official declaration of the deaths of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. She was seen crying or holding back tears on both occasions, a departure from the thunderous tone she is best known for outside North Korea. Ms Chun Hee's career is unique in its longevity - long outlasting those of others who worked for KCTV but were demoted or purged. She retired temporarily in 2012, but appeared again four years later to announce a missile launch and has been back on screens regularly since. But what will happen when Ms Chun Hee steps down for good? The grandmother - who lives with her family in relative luxury in Pyongyang - is said to have turned her focus away from the cameras. Instead, she is working on training the next generation of North Korea's newsreaders. ""Many anchor women now are very young and beautiful and are more suitable to appear before the viewers,"" she said."
2017-09-04,Anybody of a certain age will remember collecting empty glass drinks bottles and taking them back to the shop for cash.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170904220851/http://news.sky.com/story/sky-ocean-rescue-why-plastic-bottle-return-scheme-is-a-big-deal-11020843,"It was a great way of topping up pocket money - and it helped keep the streets clean. But returnable deposits died out when manufacturers put their fizzy drinks in plastic. And just look at the roadside verges now. Zero Waste Scotland (ZWS) calculates that 60,000 plastic bottles are littered every day north of the border. Inevitably some of those get blown by the wind or flushed by rainfall into rivers. Next stop, the open ocean. Plastic drinks bottles make up a third of marine plastic pollution. They break down into tiny pieces over many decades and end up in the food chain. That's why the return of a deposit scheme is such a big deal - and why Sky Ocean Rescue has campaigned for it. Deposits give waste a value. ZWS estimates cashback on empties would reduce the number of littered bottles by 50,000 every day. It doesn't have to be a big financial incentive to work. In Norway, a standard 500ml drinks bottle has a deposit of one Kroner (about 10p), a larger one 2.5 Kroner (25p). Around 96% of bottles are returned. Many supermarkets even have 'reverse vending machines' which give out cash - or a charity donation - in exchange for eligible bottles. The collection system ensures that the plastic is pure. Bottles are made of PET, a material that can be melted down to make new bottles. But just one stray PVC bottle in a batch of 10,000 and the melt is ruined. Contamination is a big issue with kerbside recycling. But in Norway the higher value of the pure plastic - as well as the 4% of deposits that go unclaimed - help to fund the scheme. Earlier this year, partly in response to Sky's campaign, Coca-Cola, the world's biggest soft-drinks manufacturer, dropped its opposition to a deposit return scheme in Scotland. It was an unprecedented move - the company has always opposed the schemes in other parts of the world prior to their introduction. It removed a significant hurdle to deposits making a comeback in Scotland. And now the Scottish government is stepping up. The UK government needs to do the same. It had the courage to impose a 5p charge on plastic bags, despite a potential public backlash, reducing the number handed out to shoppers by six billion in just one year. It needs to use the same principles to reduce littering of plastic bottles. Financial incentives work. Bring back the bottle deposit."

It comes as more than 100 former workers at Bletchley - Britain's codebreaking World War II site - held a reunion. They gathered at the former government offices in Buckinghamshire, which are now open as a tourist attraction. There were 8,994 staff based at Bletchley during the war and their work is said to have cut two years off the length of WWII. It's thought there are now only around 300 still alive. Their work was popularised by The Imitation Game, which saw Benedict Cumberbatch cast as Alan Turing, a codebreaker credited with cracking the Nazi's enigma code. Historian Dr Kenyon told Sky News: ""Alastair Denniston was absolutely vital to Bletchley Park because for the first two and a half years of the war he was head of the organisation. ""People like Alan Turing didn't get here by accident. Prior to the war, (Denniston) set about recruiting men and women of professor type, particularly bright mathematicians and linguistics he thought would be suitable when war came. As early as 1937 he was compiling lists of those people. ""The one thing that comes across with Denniston is he was good at man management and that he was quite a nice man. ""What comes across in the film is that he's a very stuffy, villainous character. I don't think that represents him at all."" Mr Denniston is also credited with establishing the beginnings of the so-called special relationship between the UK and the US, and was in charge when the first Americans visited Bletchley for an intelligence-sharing agreement. Betty Webb, 94, worked at Bletchley between 1941-1945 and was at the August reunion. She was part of a team that broke German enigma codes relating to the Holocaust. ""I didn't know until about two years ago the messages I worked on were connected with the Holocaust,"" she said. ""I'm very proud to be one of the team - but none of us knew at the time. We were obliged not to talk about it under the Official Secrets Act. What you saw, heard or read was to be kept within."" She worked in the same building as Alastair Denniston at Bletchley and told Sky News he was not portrayed correctly in the film adaptation. She said: ""I would suggest he was a fair and benign man. I didn't meet him myself, I feel concerned he was portrayed as a harsh man and I always say to people they must realise that film was fine, it does tell that part of the story. ""But there's much more to it than that and I try to make people that want the whole story realise that."" Mary Watkins, now 97, was just 19 when she was sent to Bletchley and revealed just how secretive the work was. ""It was top secret,"" she said. ""You were afraid to use a word even like 'call sign'. I would cringe if anyone used the word 'call sign'... ""It's hard to express just how you knew it was so secret. It was like proof reading and we were never told whether it was right or wrong."""
2017-09-04,"Although analysts are doubtful about North Korea's claim to have carried out a successful hydrogen bomb test, the size of the explosion was anywhere between seven and 10 times more powerful than previous tests. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170904220851/http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-how-does-h-bomb-compare-to-atomic-bomb-11020274,"It would not be the first time North Korea exaggerated its achievements - they wrongly claimed to have tested an H-bomb last January - but the country is not only on the right path towards achieving its ambitions, but it is doing so far quicker than anyone expected. Previously North Korea has tested atomic bombs, similar to those used by the US on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 - attacks that killed around 200,000 people. An H-bomb, also known as a thermonuclear device, would be immeasurably more destructive. Atom bombs are measured in kilotons - the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had yields of 13 kilotons and 21 kilotons respectively. Hydrogen bombs though are graded in megatons. The most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated was the Soviet Union's ""Tsar Bomba,"" in 1961. It had a yield of 50 megatons, making it 3,800 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. :: Key steps in North Korea's nuclear ambitions In short, the hydrogen bomb is a completely different and altogether more frightening prospect and it would put North Korea into an exclusive club of only five other countries: the US, UK, China, France and Russia. If a bomb similar to that dropped on Nagasaki fell on New York today, it would create a fireball radius of 200 metres, and a thermal radiation radius of 2.21 kilometres. ::Who is North Korea's 'nuclear' newsreader? If a bomb the scale of the Tsar Bomba was dropped on New York, there would be a fireball radius of more than three kilometres, and a thermal radiation radius of 60 kilometres. One comparison I have often heard puts it into starker but more understandable terms: an atom bomb would destroy much of Manhattan whereas an H-bomb would wipe out the entire city of New York and surrounding areas. That is why this weekend's test, whether an h-bomb or not, is another level. Kim Jong Un has accelerated the country's nuclear programme far beyond anything his father oversaw - there have been three nuclear tests and four missile tests in the last two years alone. If North Korea hasn't already developed a hydrogen bomb then it is likely it will, before long, unless dramatically stopped. The reality now though, is that the world needs to stop agonising over how it will get rid of a North Korean nuke and instead consider how it is best going live with it"

Dogs lost the scent from her cuddly toy at a car park outside the wedding venue, suggesting she may have been driven away. A 34-year-old man was charged on Sunday with the ""kidnapping, illegal confinement or arbitrary detention of a minor of less than 15 years"". The man's lawyer told the AFP news agency his client admitted during police questioning that the girl had got into the car - but that he denied abducting her. He said the suspect, who has not been named, said Maelys had ""got into his car with a little boy, onto the back seat to see if his (the suspect's) dog was in the boot"". The man - a guest at the wedding - was arrested last week, along with a friend, over inconsistencies in his statement, but the pair were later released. It emerged the suspect washed his car after the wedding, but his lawyer said it was because he wanted to sell it. The suspect is said to live near Pont-de-Beauvoisin with his parents and his re-arrest came after police discovered new evidence. ""Confronted with testimony, findings and scientific evidence, he persisted in his denials and explanations,"" the prosecutor's office in Grenoble said on Sunday. ""This did not convince the investigative judges, who decided to hold him."" Maelys was at the wedding with her parents and was wearing a white dress and had a cuddly toy with her. Police have interviewed about 250 people, including nearly all of the 180 guests at the wedding, as well as people at parties held the same night at a bar and church hall. Meanwhile, the massive search for the nine-year-old continues. On Saturday, hundreds of volunteers braved heavy rain to look for her and police have also been scouring through photos and videos taken by wedding guests to look for any unusual activity. Police chief Yves Marzin said: ""It is like looking for a needle in a haystack, extremely tedious work but very important."""

Mrs O'Neill said: ""There is a short window in front of us where we need to find solutions and a way forward. ""We need a short, sharp and focused negotiation in the small time-frame we have ahead of us."" Mrs Foster stated a decision must be made quickly.

Principal Pat McGuckian explained: ""In the last five years, we've made 10 redundancies in terms of teaching staff. ""This year, we've had to make support staff redundant. ""While making teaching staff redundant increases class sizes and puts more pressure on teachers, making support staff redundant is going to impact on the most vulnerable in our school. ""They're going to fall off the end educationally because there's no one to help them and keep them in school."" Northern Ireland's devolved government, which collapsed in January over a botched renewable energy scheme, had agreed a plan to reduce waiting lists in the health service - but with no health minister in office to implement it, doctors say lives could be lost. Dr Grainne Doran, who chairs the Royal College of GPs in Northern Ireland, explained: ""The difficulty with elective care is that if your waiting time for that becomes excessively long, change can happen. ""That's one of the pressures that we as GPs are under, that we need to keep an eye on and monitor those patients. ""If there is a failure to escalate if change does occur, then that can in theory put lives at risk."""

Addressing the UN Security Council, Ms Haley said ""enough is enough"" and warned its approach of imposing ""incremental"" sanctions against the secretive nation had not worked. The envoy urged the 15-member council, which is discussing the crisis, to adopt the ""strongest possible measures"". She said the US will come up with a new UN sanctions resolution and aims to put it to a vote next Monday. According to South Korea's defence ministry, the North appears to be preparing to launch ballistic missiles, possibly intercontinental. It comes after the rogue state detonated what it called a hydrogen bomb on Sunday - its sixth and biggest nuclear detonation. The regime said the test was a ""perfect success"" and involved a bomb designed to be mounted on its newly-developed intercontinental ballistic missile. The device, which is thought to have been about five times larger than the bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki in World War II, caused a manmade earthquake. :: How does H-Bomb compare to atomic bomb? Ms Haley said: ""Despite our efforts the North Korea nuclear programme is more advanced and more dangerous than ever. ""War is never something the United States wants. We don't want it now. But our country's patience is not unlimited."" America's defence secretary, General James Mattis, said on Sunday any threat to the US, its territories or its allies by Pyongyang would be met with a ""massive military response"". He said America was ""not looking to the total annihilation"" of the North but ""we have many options to do so"". South Korea will now ramp up its own military response. It has fired missiles into the sea to simulate an attack on the North's main nuclear testing site and is also preparing fresh military drills with the US. :: Who is North Korea's 'nuclear' newsreader? The latest test by the Pyongyang regime came less than a week after the council strongly condemned the North's ""outrageous"" launch of a ballistic missile over Japan. Meanwhile China, which is the North's biggest trading partner, has said President Trump's threat to cut off trade with countries that deal with Pyongyang is unacceptable. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it was not fair - as Beijing had worked on resolving the crisis via talks and that effort was not being recognised. :: Key steps in North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions China's UN envoy Liu Jieyi has warned it will not allow chaos and war on the Korean peninsula. He said the situation was ""deteriorating constantly, falling into a vicious circle"" and urged the North to ""stop taking actions that are wrong"". He also called on all parties to ""seriously consider"" Beijing's proposal for a joint suspension of Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes and military drills by the US and South Korea."

According to the Birmingham Mail, unrest at the Category B jail began at about 3.30pm on Sunday - with anti-riot Tornado teams sent to the scene. In December 2016, hundreds of prisoners at HMP Birmingham went on the rampage for 12 hours in what was described as the worst prison riot since Strangeways in 1990.

Transplant specialists are now urging people to discuss the issue with family members. Reluctance to talk about the issue is contributing to a deadly shortage of organs, according to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT). Anthony Clarkson, assistant director of organ donation for NHSBT, said: ""It's a tragedy, hundreds of people are dying unnecessarily every year waiting for transplants. ""We know that if everyone who supported donation talked about it and agreed to donate, most of those lives would be saved. ""A few words now can make an extraordinary difference. It will also make things much easier for your family to make the right decision."" Gareth Powell, a cystic fibrosis sufferer from Merseyside, had a double lung transplant when he was 21. Three years before the operation, his sister Gemma died aged 22 while waiting for a similar transplant. She also had cystic fibrosis. Now 31, Mr Powell said: ""I wanted to make sure I did not take my transplant for granted and I didn't waste it. ""I do as much as I can with my own life almost in the memory (of the anonymous donor). Their sacrifice for me was absolutely worth it."" After the transplant, Gareth went on to find work, get married and have a son who is now almost three years old. On 25 August, there were 6,414 people in need of a new organ on the transplant waiting list - and Monday marks the start of Organ Donation Week. Euan Sutherland, a specialist nurse for NHSBT, said: ""Our key message is many people have never discussed organ donation. ""About 177 families each year - three per week - say no as they have never had the conversation and they think the safest thing to do is to say no in terms of organ donation. ""I'd like more people to have that conversation with family and friends so their wishes are known should they be one of the people asked about organ donation. ""Organ donation saves lives.

2017-09-04,"On the face of it, a handful of workers going on strike at McDonald's is no big deal. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170904220851/http://news.sky.com/story/mcdonalds-uk-strike-unlikely-to-alarm-fast-food-giant-11020120,"Some 40 workers - the company says it is actually only 14 - going on strike, out of a total UK workforce of 85,000, hardly seems earth-shattering. Only two of the company's 1,270 UK restaurants - in Cambridge and Crayford - are affected. However, the strike does have significance, and not just because it is the first in this country since the fast-food behemoth opened its first UK restaurant at Woolwich, south London, in 1974. It is notoriously hard to get the type of workers who walked out today to join a union, let alone go on strike. Getting even a handful of employees to do so is an achievement of sorts. The question is whether other McDonald's UK employees will want to take similar action. The chances are that they will not. McDonald's UK announced in April that it was giving workers the choice between working on a flexible contract or on a fixed contract with a minimum number of working hours guaranteed to them. According to the company, 86% of workers chose to remain on flexible contracts. This was unsurprising. While some people deplore so-called zero-hours contracts as exploitative, research suggests most people working in this way like the flexibility of such arrangements. Many tend to be students, who are juggling work with their studies, or older workers who wish not to work full-time but who like to remain active by working periodically. Moreover, according to the latest employment data, the number of people working on such contracts is falling. During the three months to the end of June, the number of workers on zero-hours contracts fell by 20,000 to 883,000, while most jobs presently being created are full-time. What is surprising about the McDonald's dispute is that, in offering workers the choice between flexible working or a fixed-hours contract, the company has actually followed what is regarded as best practice. The other issue raised by the strikers is pay. The strikers argue a business enjoying strong profits growth like McDonald's UK can afford to pay more - and, again, this strike encapsulates a wider global debate. Globally, relative to corporate profits, wages have been static for years. The counter-argument is that the over-riding problem faced by the UK economy is poor productivity. According to the latest data, productivity per UK worker is now actually lower than before the financial crisis. Without improvements in productivity, employers argue, they cannot afford to raise wages. That is why, even though unemployment is at a 42-year low, wages growth has been stagnant. There is one more significant factor about the McDonald's strike. Many on the Left hate McDonald's. For the likes of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, both of whom have backed the strikers, McDonald's - due to its size and presence in so many countries - embodies globalisation. Their opinions of McDonald's have changed little since the 1990s when, in a public relations disaster, the company sued a pair of unemployed vegetarian campaigners who had libelled it in a leaflet making claims about the company and its food. McDonald's won the case but, in the process, came across as an unfeeling corporate Goliath bullying a couple of plucky Davids. Shortly afterwards, the term ""McJob"" was coined, shorthand for a low-paid job with poor prospects. The irony is that McDonald's learned from the experience and worked hard to turn around public perception of its food and its employment practices. It has since won countless awards for being a model employer and for offering good career advancement. Nine in 10 of its UK restaurant managers started out as ""crew"" and have worked for the company for an average of 15 years. McDonald's began engaging with its critics rather than just confronting them and, over time, perceptions of what it is like have improved. That generated higher sales and profits. Nowhere was that turnaround more impressive than in the UK, and the man behind it, Watford-born Steve Easterbrook, is now the global CEO of McDonald's. He will doubtless want assuring that the good work he did at McDonald's UK all those years ago is not unravelling."

The camera can detect the illuminated tip of the endoscope tube through 20cm (8in) of tissue, according to early tests. Until now, tracking the equipment has not been possible without X-rays or other expensive methods. With current methods it can also be very difficult to find out exactly where the endoscope is because the light beams scatter or bounce off tissues and organs. But the new camera can give a precise location because it can detect individual photons and measure the time it takes for light to pass through the body. The camera can also be used by the patient's bedside. Professor Kev Dhaliwal, from the University of Edinburgh, said the technology has ""immense potential"" in the medical field. ""The ability to see a device's location is crucial for many applications in healthcare, as we move forwards with minimally invasive approaches to treating disease.""

The spokeswoman said: ""We are ready to intensify negotiations. Nothing has been formally agreed, but that is something that we can discuss. ""Typically in negotiations, as time goes on you see the pace pick up."" Currently, the negotiating only takes place for one week each month in Brussels. There are reports the UK wants to move to continuous talks. At the end of the third round of talks on Friday, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there had been ""no decisive progress"" on key issues. On Monday, after a meeting with the Republic of Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney, Mr Barnier restated his aim to resolve the question of the Ireland-Northern Ireland border ahead of trade talks. The EU has previously stated it does not want to discuss future trade relations until issues over the border, the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and the divorce bill have been resolved. Despite this, the PM's spokeswoman said the Government will on Wednesday publish a position paper on post-Brexit science and innovation relations with the bloc. ""Currently we are talking with the EU about withdrawal,"" she said. ""We want to be talking about withdrawal and the future partnership. ""We are not at the stage in negotiations where we are talking about the (Brexit bill) figure. We will seek a fair settlement of our rights and obligations as a departing member state, but we are not at that stage yet."" On Sunday, Brexit Secretary David Davis accused the EU of playing ""time against money"" by trying to exert pressure on the UK to agree a divorce bill. It was reported over the weekend that Mr Barnier said he wanted to get as much money out of the UK as possible. Speaking at a conference in Italy, Mr Barnier claimed he needed to educate the UK about the price it would pay for leaving the EU. On Twitter on Monday, however, the EU negotiator claimed he had told delegates that Brexit was an ""occasion to explain single market benefits in all countries, including my own"", adding: ""We do not want to 'educate' or 'teach lessons'."" Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage called on the Government not to waste 18 months negotiating with the EU only to end up with no deal. He told Sky News that the Government should go directly to leaders of the other 27 EU countries and large firms and bypass Mr Barnier and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Mr Farage's comments came ahead of a major summit of EU leaders next month, at which Brexit is likely to be high on the agenda. Mr Farage said: ""We've got to appeal above the heads of the negotiators. We've got to go straight to national governments and indeed European companies to say a trade deal is in everyone's interest."" Preparations for the next round of talks come as Downing Street called for unity among its MPs ahead of a debate on the Government's flagship Brexit legislation. The EU Withdrawal Bill will repeal the law that allowed the UK to join the European Economic Community in the 1970s and switch 40 years' worth of EU law into domestic law."

Millennials are increasingly travelling to places such as the Greek islands to get more for their money. While Ibiza remains popular, many of its regular visitors who lived it up at the island's superclubs in the late 1990s and 2000s have now settled down and want something different from their Balearic break. Wellness and spa sessions during the day are increasingly popular, with designer hotels and VIP party experiences also on the rise. ""Ibiza is changing as its customers' tastes change,"" said Tony Hopkins, Thomas Cook's UK product director. ""The happy hardcore of the 90s and early 2000s is giving way to chillout beats to suit a growing band of thirty somethings and their young families. ""It's always been a cool destination and it's now getting more exclusive. ""The hotels on the island have invested wisely in their offer to customers which have kept customers coming back as their tastes and priorities change."" Family holidays to the island have also risen 6%, said the travel operator. Greek islands Kos and Zante are benefiting from the changing tastes, with bookings doubling for under-25s since 2009. The nightlife on offer at places such as Zante's Laganas Strip are making it one of Europe's most popular destinations for travellers on a budget. ""Kos and Zante's dedicated party areas are attractive to young revellers looking for a more affordable alternative to Ibiza,"" said Mr Hopkins from Thomas Cook. ""Greece is having a bumper year and these emerging party islands just help to broaden Greece's offer even more, while customers looking for the Mamma Mia experience have a huge range of authentic Greek hotels and restaurants across its thousands of islands."""

But it is unlikely that, as a third born royal in direct succession, he or she will become king or queen. The Prince of Wales is first in line, followed by William, Prince George and the couple's daughter Princess Charlotte, who is two. The Cambridges are also preparing for another major milestone this week - when four-year-old Prince George starts his first day at school on Thursday. The couple have chosen an independent school in Battersea, south London, where fees cost from £17,604 a year, for their firstborn.

Speculation has already started on the sex and likely name of the couple's third child, with Alice - popular with bookmakers last time - or Alexandra possibilities for a girl and Frederick, James or Philip for a boy. Bookmaker Paddy Power made Alice and Arthur their early favourites. Shortly after the news was made public, the Queen and Prince Philip attended the official opening of the Queensferry Crossing near Edinburgh. Hundreds of people cheered as the Queen cut a ribbon to signify the bridge's opening. In July Kate appeared to hint at having a third child on the family's royal tour of Poland. Given a cuddly toy meant for a newborn, she said to William, laughing: ""We will just have to have more babies.""

At 12/1 are Arthur and James; with Catherine and Mary at 14/1; and Albert, Edward, Emma, Henry, Phillip and Sarah at 16/1. Twenty years after her death, punters can also stake money on the baby being called Diana (25-1). And for fans of a certain fantasy TV series wanting an outside punt, Daenerys (500/1) and Joffrey (1000/1) are also available. Will the new child ever be king or queen? The new arrival will bump Prince Harry down to sixth in line to the throne, but it seems unlikely he or she will ever get to rule. The baby will be behind Charles, William, George and Charlotte. A few years ago, the new arrival (if male) would have jumped ahead of Princess Charlotte, but after hundreds of years the law was finally changed in 2013. Now the elder child is ahead in succession - regardless of gender. (After Prince Harry, next in line to the throne is Prince Andrew, followed by his two daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie). When is the baby due? Perhaps spring time - Kate, 35, is said to be less than 12 weeks pregnant but the due date has not yet been revealed. Kate pregnancy: Hyperemesis gravidarum explained Kensington Palace had to announce her pregnancy early after she was forced to pull out of a public engagement because of morning sickness. Youngest child - an outgoing charmer? If William and Kate stop at three children, the newborn will be nearly three years younger than Charlotte and nearly five years younger than big brother George. Psychologist Alfred Adler put forward a well-known theory on birth order and traits of the youngest sibling. He said they are often the rebel and take a different path to their siblings. They tend to be outgoing, charming and funny in order to get attention and compete with their brothers and sisters. Well-known actors who are youngest children include Jennifer Lawrence, Jim Carrey, Billy Crystal and Eddie Murphy. George prepares to start school this week However, the child may also be more pampered than the other children - which could lead to dependence, selfishness and irresponsibility when they enter adulthood."

The severity of the vomiting caused by hyperemesis gravidarum can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine called ketosis. Hyperemesis gravidarum affects 3.5 per 1,000 pregnant women and can cause women to vomit blood. Sky News science correspondent Thomas Moore said: ""The first step would be to get a woman on to a drip as soon as possible, get some fluid back into her bloodstream. ""If that doesn't settle things, doctors can in fact stick a tube all the way through the stomach into the small intestines to make sure there is some nutrition getting into the mother.

What you are going through is deemed by many people as normal, they just think you are being sick quite a lot. ""I was sick over 35 times a day, every day until the 35th week of my pregnancy, which means you lose weight. In my case I was put on drips to be rehydrated, put on steroids to keep my body warning.

Retired midwife Val Clarke told Sky News in 2012: ""It often happens in very slim young ladies who - I don't know the reason why - become pregnant and the demands of the pregnancy are overwhelming to the point that vomiting becomes much more severe much earlier. ""Poor Kate, it would appear she is having very early symptoms which are very severe. ""It is not anything that needs to be worried about, although in extreme cases sometimes termination is required because the mother becomes very, very ill and dehydrated.""

His recommendation comes in a report, commissioned by Theresa May, in which he also calls for more women and ethnic minority recruits, as well as more black and Asian generals, admirals and RAF top brass. Mr Francois blames political correctness, left-wing teaching and an emphasis on ""peace studies"" in schools for the failure to educate children about the role and value of the UK's Armed Forces in the world. In his report, ""Filling the Ranks"", he claims young people leaving school have ""little, if any"" exposure to the Armed Forces and do not even consider the military as a potential career option. Other reasons for a 10% shortfall in recruitment facing the Armed Forces - and 30% in the Army - he believes, include record employment levels and more school leavers going to university. ""You have to make it a formal part of the curriculum to ensure it will be taught,"" he said. ""There is a risk you could encounter resistance from some left-wing teachers to the idea. ""Research shows that young people today don't necessarily have much familiarity with the Armed Forces unless they served in a cadet unit or someone from their family served in uniform. ""You have large numbers of people leaving education with no real understanding of the Armed Forces and why it's important to them."" Mr Francois believes children could be taught about the military as part of lessons on citizenship and wants more cadet units in schools to give children ""a greater opportunity to experience the military ethos and to benefit from it"". On the scale of the recruitment crisis and problems of retention facing the forces, the MP claims all three branches of the military are ""running to stand still"" as they struggle to replace the numbers leaving. ""This continuing process of 'hollowing out' in the ranks, while costing the Armed Forces valuable experience, also threatens to compound the problem by increasing the pressure on those personnel who remain,"" he added. On numbers, Mr Francois says: • In the year to April 2017, 12,950 recruits joined the regular Armed Forces, but 14,970 service personnel left in the same period • The Army needs to recruit 10,000 people a year to maintain its strength, but only managed to attract 7,000 entrants last year. Mr Francois also believes the Ministry of Defence (MoD) needs to do ""far better"" at recruiting people from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds as they currently make up only 7% of the Armed Forces. The former MP points out there is no BAME officer of two-star rank, Major General level, or above, in the military and women make up just 10% of the Armed Forces. His report also highlights the fact 14,269 people per year applying to join the military are turned down on medical grounds, often for ""relatively minor ailments"" such as asthma or eczema. Responding to the report, an MoD spokesman said: ""We thank Mr Francois for his report and agree that recruitment is one of the MOD's top priorities. ""Joining the military offers the opportunity for a great career, learning new skills and gaining unique experiences not available in civilian life. ""We're aware of and working on the issues outlined in the report, including investing in recruiting the next generation of talent, diversifying our workforce and increasing our reserve numbers."""

2017-09-05,"The Home Office is being accused of a ""mean and cynical"" immigration crackdown after a leaked Brexit blueprint revealed plans to slam the door on thousands of unskilled EU migrants.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170905223913/http://news.sky.com/story/leaked-post-brexit-immigration-plans-branded-mean-and-cynical-11022214,"Under detailed proposals drawn up by Home Office officials, Britain will end Brussels' free movement of labour rules immediately after Brexit and introduce restrictions to deter all but highly-skilled EU workers. The 82-page document, marked as extremely sensitive and dated August 2017, amounts to a ""British jobs for British workers"" strategy and will delight hard-line Brexiteers but anger pro-Remain MPs. It says: ""Put plainly, this means that, to be considered valuable to the country as a whole, immigration should benefit not just the migrants themselves but also make existing residents better off."" The document proposes measures to drive down the number of lower-skilled EU migrants by offering them residency for a maximum of only two years. Those in ""high-skilled occupations"" would be granted permits to work three to five years. The document also describes a phased introduction to a new immigration system; ending the right to settle in Britain for most EU migrants and tough new restrictions on rights to bring in family members - meaning many families could be split up. Showing a passport would be mandatory for all EU nationals wanting to enter Britain and there would be a system of temporary biometric residence permits for all EU nationals coming into the UK after Brexit for more than a few months. The Home Office paper is entitled ""The Border, Immigration and Citizenship System After the UK Leaves the European Union"" and has already prompted a fierce political row, after being leaked to The Guardian. A Government spokesperson told Sky News: ""We do not comment on leaked draft documents. ""We will be setting out our initial proposals for a new immigration system which takes back control of the UK's borders later in the autumn."" But Sky sources have confirmed it is an authentic Home Office document, although it contains just draft proposals that do not necessarily reflect ministerial thinking and are not Government policy. One insider told Sky News: ""This draft is a relatively early version and the proposals have since changed substantially."" Opposition MPs have reacted angrily to the leak, which comes only weeks after rows over Home Office letters threatening EU citizens with deportation and discredited statistics on overseas students remaining in the UK. Labour MP Alison McGovern, a leading supporter of the pro-Remain group Open Britain, said: ""This leaked document is part and parcel of a mean and cynical approach which is already deterring people from coming here. ""For example, by sending deportation letters to people with every right to be here, and justifying a Home Office crackdown on international students by deploying totally bogus statistics."" Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee of MPs, added: ""This document seems to contradict the Home Secretary's decision just over a month ago to ask the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to provide all the evidence to underpin a new immigration policy. ""Why have they asked the MAC to do a major programme of work if they have already decided what they want to do?"" London mayor Sadiq Khan branded the proposals ""a blueprint on how to strangle our economy"", while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the plans were ""wrong in principle and would be deeply economically damaging"". Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O'Grady claimed the plans ""would do nothing to tackle falling living standards and insecure jobs"", adding: ""These plans would create an underground economy, encouraging bad bosses to exploit migrants and undercut decent employers offering good jobs."" Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, said: ""Food and drink manufacturing, Britain's largest manufacturing sector, will be alarmed by the proposals. ""If this does represent the Government's thinking it shows a deep lack of understanding of the vital contribution that EU migrant workers make - at all skill levels - across the food chain."" Other proposals in the Home Office document include: :: Plans to restrict EU immigration by giving ""preference in the job market to resident workers"". The Government could also restrict EU nationals from seeking work, reduce the opportunities for workers to settle in the UK long-term, and limit the number of EU citizens able to come to the UK to do low-skilled work. ::Proposals for a ""stepping stone"" temporary implementation period for ""at least two years"" after Brexit day. That would be followed by the introduction of the full immigration policy for EU nationals. :: Plans to scrap EU rules on the rights of extended family members to reside in the UK. The document says ""there is virtually no limit on the distance of the relationship between the EU citizen and the family member"" in the current system. ""We propose to define family members as direct family members only, plus durable partners,"" it adds. :: If an EU national living in the UK wants to bring their spouse from outside the EU here, he or she will have to earn a minimum of £18,600 a year, bringing EU nationals in line with the restriction already imposed on Britons. ::No new border checks for EU nationals entering the country, although they will be required to travel on a passport not a national identity card. Instead all new EU arrivals will have ""deemed leave"" to enter Britain for an as yet unspecified period, likely to between three and six months. After that, to stay longer, they will have to apply for a biometric residence permit, which may include a fingerprint. :: In contrast to the ""free movement directive"", residence permits will not be granted to jobseekers. A specific ""income threshold"" will be introduced for ""self-sufficient"" migrants. :: Plans to introduce ""right to work"" checks. These would have to be carried out by employers, with criminal sanctions possible against companies and individuals if illegal working is discovered. Leaked plans to deter EU migrants are a blueprint on how to strangle our economy. Wrong for London & for Britain. https://t.co/raStpjrxbx On its ""Britain first"" theme, the document states: ""We are clear that, wherever possible, UK employers should look to meet their labour needs from resident labour. ""It is now more important than ever that we have the right skills domestically to build a strong and competitive economy."" The paper adds that although long-term net migration from the EU has fallen over the last year to 133,000, it cannot be controlled because free movement rules give EU citizens ""a right to reside in the UK regardless of the economic needs of the country""."

Her daughter's fatal injuries - said to have been caused after she was stamped on - were likened to that of a car crash victim and her mother was jailed for murder. The court heard how she was a ""frail little girl (who) was viciously crushed"" in her own bedroom, surrounded by her toys. The judge called Smith a ""devious, manipulative and selfish young woman"" and she was ordered to serve a minimum of 24 years for murder, later reduced to 19 years. Her partner, Matthew Rigby, was sentenced to three and half years in jail for causing or allowing Ayeeshia-Jayne's death at their home. In the Derbyshire Safeguarding Children Board report which has now been released, the little girl was described by her family as ""a beautiful girl with an infectious smile, twinkling eyes and a bubbly personality, a gentle and loving little girl"". It examined Kathryn Smith's chaotic lifestyle and her contact with professionals throughout her daughter's lifetime. It concluded: ""From the facts and evidence in this case such an act by M (Mother) could not have been predicted. ""The birth father himself admitted to the review author that whilst he had many concerns about his ex-partner's behaviour, the people she associated with and her reliance on alcohol, at no time did he anticipate that she would fatally harm their daughter."" Smith's alcohol and drug use, which saw her store cannabis in her daughter's drinks beaker, meant she was in contact with various health professionals and authorities. Too often though, her needs as a domestic violence victim ""overshadowed"" the interests of her daughter. In summary, the report said: ""The case showed how difficult it is for agencies to retain a child-centred focus when the needs of a young parent facing domestic abuse continue to dominate."" It made nine recommendations and also found that the day before Ayeeshia-Jayne died health professionals had described a ""growing sense of unease"" about the risks of domestic violence. This led to a multi-agency risk assessment conference being held on 30 April 2014. Tragically, Ayeeshia-Jayne was killed the following day before further action could be taken."

The Unite union claimed the company had reneged on a promise to offer workers on zero-hours contracts guaranteed hours - a pledge it had made following last year's storm over its treatment of workers amid claims of ""Victorian"" conditions. :: Sports Direct appoints first employee representative Unite said it had seen job advertisements showing that Sports Direct had moved to hire casual labour on such ""abusive"" contracts. The union's assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: ""This revelation shows it is 'business as usual' at Sports Direct and casts doubt on just how sincere it is about cleaning up its act."" He added: ""With the retailer advertising for casual workers in its Sports Direct and upmarket Flannels stores across the UK, it is clear this is no mistake, but a return to the bad old ways once the spotlight had gone away."" Sports Direct was yet to respond to a request for a statement by Sky News. The accusation followed on from further criticism the union levelled against the firm recently, when it claimed staff feedback arrangements did not give anonymity. Unite has said it is supporting institutional investors and shareholder advisory groups which are urging against the re-election of Mr Hellawell during Wednesday's AGM at the sprawling Shirebrook complex in Derbyshire. He has survived two previous votes in the past 12 months - thanks to chief executive Mike Ashley's majority voting rights. But Mr Hellawell, a former chief constable and Government drugs tsar, said in January he would quit the role if he did not secure support from a majority of independent shareholders. There is also some shareholder anger over Mr Ashley's decision not to attend. He has blamed ""conflicting demands"" on his time - potentially demonstrating a dire state of relations between investors and Mr Ashley at a time when the chain is battling falling profits and pressures from the Brexit-hit pound in addition to criticism of the way it works. :: Mike Ashley tells judge: 'I like to get drunk' While Phoenix Asset Management Partners and Aurora Investment Trust have signalled their intention to vote for Mr Hellawell's reappointment, at least three other investors are going the other way. Hermes, Royal London Asset Management and Standard Life Aberdeen said they were joining three shareholder advisory groups in taking a stand against its corporate governance standards. Hermes, however, said it was welcome that Mr Ashley was now running the FTSE 250 company since the departure of its previous chief executive Dave Forsey."

Ten-year-old Makayah McDermott and his aunt Rosie Cooper, 34, were killed when the stolen vehicle hit them in Lennard Road in Penge, southeast London. Three girls, who were related to the pair, were also injured. The stolen car was being chased by two police officers in a marked vehicle when it struck the five victims. IPCC operations manager Catherine Hall said: ""Following our investigation I have now decided to make a referral to the CPS as there is an indication that two officers may have committed criminal offences relating to their actions both during and following the pursuit. ""The referral relates to both the driver and the passenger of the police vehicle. ""I am satisfied we have gathered all the available evidence and it is now for the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether to bring criminal charges."" The IPCC said its investigation report has also been sent to the Metropolitan Police to determine whether disciplinary proceedings should be taken against the officers. The driver of the stolen car, Joshua Dobby, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Makayah McDermott and Rozanne Cooper earlier this year. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in their deaths. Dobby, a drug addict son of a millionaire, was out on licence when the crash took place and had 53 previous convictions."

2017-09-05,"Public sector pay is set to rise above inflation for the first time in eight years, Downing Street has signalled.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170905223913/http://news.sky.com/story/public-sector-pay-cap-to-be-lifted-next-year-11021156,"Theresa May and Philip Hammond are understood to be drawing up plans to raise the pay cap, which has limited pay rises to 1% a year since 2010. Scrapping it for all public sector workers would cost £4bn but ministers may support a staggered approach, prioritising areas such as nursing where there are staffing shortages. The pay of NHS staff, teachers and others in the public sector has been a subject of concern in Downing Street and the Treasury since the snap election result in June. Ministers are due to send out letters to the independent pay review bodies within weeks, in which they can offer guidance, and are understood to be preparing to back a lifting of the cap. It comes after pressure within the Cabinet, with Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, and Justine Greening, the Education Secretary, lobbying behind the scenes for a pay rise. Boris Johnson infuriated Downing Street by publicly throwing his weight behind calls for the cap to be lifted in July, saying public sector workers should be ""getting a better deal"". Other members of Cabinet had argued against it - with Mr Hammond reportedly telling colleagues public sector workers were overpaid - but it may now feature in his first Autumn Budget. Around 30% of public sector workers are in the NHS, and another 30% work in education. Both sectors have struggled with recruitment and retention of staff in recent years. During a TV event before the election Mrs May was tackled by a nurse, who asked the Prime Minister why her pay had fallen by 14% in real terms. Mrs May told her there was ""no magic money tree"". Asked about the reports on Monday, the Prime Minister's spokeswoman said: ""We are listening. We know that many people in the public and private sector feel they are just about managing. We recognise the sacrifice that they are making, but there is a process in place and I can't pre-empt that process."" Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary, did not play down the reports in an interview on Tuesday morning, saying such decisions would be announced at the Budget. One plan reportedly under consideration is for the lowest-paid public sector workers in sectors struggling to recruit to have the pay cap lifted in April next year, with others to follow in 2019. Giving higher raises to public sector workers who live in areas with steeper costs of living, which already happens in London, under so-called 'London weighting', is also said to be under consideration. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, will ratchet up the pressure as she is expected to announce today that the cap will end in Scotland next year, when she unveils her Government's legislative programme for 2017-18. David Cameron and George Osborne announced the pay cap in 2010 and it was due to last 10 years. Union leaders welcomed the reports it may be lifted. Rehana Azam, national secretary of the GMB union, said: ""This damaging policy has seen thousands pinched from public sector workers over seven years. All public sector workers must receive proper pay rises - including those not covered by pay review bodies, such as school support staff, council workers and police staff."" Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, who was a minister in the coalition government which introduced the freeze, said: ""The situation has changed since it was first introduced, at a time when there was a real budget emergency and fear of large-scale unemployment. ""The issue we face now is very different. We are struggling to recruit and retain public sector staff and the effects of this recruitment crisis are being felt across the board, from our schools to our hospitals."" Labour sought to capitalise on the Government's discomfort over public sector pay by tabling an amendment to the Queen's Speech in June, calling for the cap to be scrapped. Tory MPs voted against it, but many subsequently expressed their concerns about it, and said they would push for it privately."

Brexit Secretary David Davis came in second with 15%. However, 19% ticked the ""other"" box. The 1,309-strong vote is seen as a reliable barometer of grassroots mood, though it can also shift quickly. Mr Rees-Mogg was second favourite in the survey last month. The colourful backbencher and staunch Brexit supporter, known as ""the MP for the 18th century"" for his unashamedly old-fashioned ways, has enjoyed growing popularity in recent months. He has become an unlikely social media darling. And as MPs return to Westminster amid speculation of a ministerial reshuffle, he has been named among rising Tory stars who might be up for promotion.  To his supporters, he is a right-wing antidote to Jeremy Corbyn for authenticity and charisma, but critics say the old Etonian would reinforce the view that Conservatives are privileged and detached. Commenting on the survey, Paul Goodman, the ConservativeHome editor, said Mr Rees-Mogg's surge is the result of ""party member disillusion with the present senior options"" to replace Mrs May. ""In the absence of anyone that party members find convincing, Rees-Mogg is a gainer from what is essentially a protest vote,"" he wrote. Chancellor Philip Hammond won just 3% of votes, while 7% went to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Rees-Mogg - who over the summer announced the birth of his sixth child, Sixtus Dominic Boniface Christopher - has dismissed media reports he is considering running for the top job. ""I think if I threw my hat in the ring, my hat would be thrown back at me pretty quickly,"" he said. However, he has not ruled out standing for the leadership in the future. He has also thrown his support behind Mrs May, who announced last week she wants to lead the Tories at the next General Election in 2022. The announcement was met with scepticism from some of her own MPs, following Mrs May's poor showing at the last vote in June. But Mr Rees-Mogg told Sky News last week that the PM is doing a ""good job"" in Brexit talks and deserves to be backed."
2017-09-05,"Peter Madsen, the Danish inventor charged with killing Kim Wall, has said she died after being hit by a hatch cover aboard his submarine. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170905223913/http://news.sky.com/story/submarine-owner-says-journalist-kim-wall-died-after-being-hit-by-hatch-cover-11021761,"Testifying in court on Tuesday, Madsen claimed he had been holding the hatch for Ms Wall and had slipped, causing the heavy cover to fall on the journalist. ""I lose my foothold and the hatch shuts,"" he said. ""Kim had been severely hurt and was laying with an intense bleeding. There was a pool of blood where she had landed."" The accident happened as the pair were sailing in the strait between Denmark and Sweden, he claimed. Ms Wall, a Swedish freelance reporter, had been visiting Madsen in his Nautilus submarine to research an article when she disappeared on the night of 10 August. Private ships and the Danish navy were called to an emergency search for the 60ft submarine after Ms Wall was last seen boarding it and did not return home. The following morning Madsen had to be rescued from the vessel as it sank, initially telling authorities that Ms Wall had been safely dropped off near Copenhagen. But when it emerged the reporter was still unaccounted for he told investigators she had died in an accident on board. He was then charged with manslaughter. Ms Wall's mutilated remains - a torso with the head, arms and legs sawn off - were later discovered by a cyclist in Koge bay. Investigators later revealed that the body, identified by DNA evidence, had been attached to a piece of metal and cut in a way that aimed to ensure it would sink and remain on the sea bed. The rest of Ms Wall's remains have not been found. Police also concluded that the submarine - built and crowdfunded by Madsen himself, and the largest privately built vessel of its kind - had been purposefully sunk. Strict reporting restrictions in Danish courts mean only limited information has been available on the case and the cause of the young woman's death has not yet been determined. Ms Wall, 30, was a respected freelance journalist, who had reported from China, Uganda and Haiti for a wide range of publications, on topics including furries, feminism and voodoo. Commenting on her death, her family said her work had brought her to many dangerous places, but that it was ""unimaginable"" something could happen ""just a few miles from the childhood home""."

It found the company had infringed Mr Barbulescu's right to privacy by not informing him in advance that it was recording the messages he sent on the account. Some of the messages were described as being ""of an intimate nature"". Neil Brown, a solicitor at specialist digital law firm Decoded Legal, told Sky News that ""in this particular case, the monitoring violated the employee's fundamental rights. ""However, the judgment recognises that there are legitimate reasons for monitoring employees' use of IT systems, and gives useful guidance as to how employers can tackle the issue in a lawful manner."" In order to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), companies must let their staff know in advance if their communications are being monitored. The monitoring must also be carried out for a legitimate aim and limited to what is necessary and proportionate to achieve that aim. The Strasbourg court is the international court established by the ECHR, which is a separate institution from the European Union, and was founded in 1959. The ECHR was principally drafted by Sir David Maxwell Fyfe after the Second World War. Sir David was a Conservative Party politician and eventual home secretary, as well as a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials. As home secretary, the current Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK should remain in the European Union but withdrawn from the ECHR. This is not currently the Government's policy."

The soldiers were arrested in Brecon, Ipswich and at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, according to Sky sources. Three of the four serve with the Royal Anglian Regiment. The men are accused of being part of the National Action group, which was banned last year. Police said the four were arrested ""on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism... namely on suspicion of being a member of a proscribed organisation (National Action)"". They are being held at a West Midlands police station and a number of properties are being searched. Police said the arrests - carried out by counter-terror officers from the West Midlands, East Midlands and Wales - were planned and intelligence-led, with no threat to public safety. Authorities arrived at one semi detached home in Great Barr, north Birmingham, at around 6am, neighbours said. ""It seemed quite low key but they were there for most of the morning until early afternoon,"" the witness recalled. ""They had the battering ram to put the door in but apart from that it seemed the police didn't want to attract too much attention."" A statement from the MoD said: ""We can confirm that a number of serving members of the Army have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for being associated with a proscribed far right group. ""These arrests are the consequence of a police-led operation supported by the Army."" National Action was banned in December 2016 by the Home Secretary, meaning it is a criminal offence to be a member. Amber Rudd told Parliament at the time: ""National Action is a racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic organisation which stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideology, and I will not stand for it. ""It has absolutely no place in a Britain that works for everyone."" The group conducts ""provocative street demonstrations and stunts aimed at intimidating local communities"", according to the official list of banned groups, which says it tries to recruit young people. The document also links National Action with the murder of MP Jo Cox in 2016. The phrase ""Death to traitors, freedom for Britain!"" - said by her right-wing extremist killer Thomas Mair in court - is associated with the group. Twenty-two members of National Action were arrested in 2016, according to police."

It announced the ballot 10 days before Royal Mail is due to be relegated from the top-flight FTSE 100 share index following an erosion in its market value - a degradation some market analysts partly-blamed on the risk of strikes. :: Royal Mail offers new pension deal to avert strikes The CWU's deputy general secretary, Terry Pullinger, said: ""Talks have been taking place since April 2016, but the sense of shared purpose has drifted as privatisation has evolved. ""Quite frankly, three years or more into privatisation, we are seeing its promises shattered as the company has deserted the mutual interest approach to one of minimising cost and maximising shareholder return. ""This has led to actual and intended attacks on our members' pensions, terms and conditions and ways of working. ""The conventional wisdom of more insecure employment models, inadequate DC (Defined Contribution) pension arrangements and gig economy labour practices are influencing the company's strategic thinking, which is in direct conflict to the agreements we have in place. ""Our dispute is not only about protecting our members but also protecting a great public service and national institution, the Royal Mail Group, which should never have been privatised."" The company responded: ""We believe there are no grounds for industrial action. ""We remain committed to reaching a negotiated agreement with the CWU on pay and pensions, and other issues we have been discussing. ""A ballot does not necessarily mean there will be industrial action."" The company said its new proposals to resolve the pension row would give staff the best deal in the delivery industry - insisting it had ""moved a long way"" from the original plan. Both sides said they were willing to engage in further talks in the hope of averting any disruption."

2017-09-05,"It has become a regular feature during the 15 months since the UK voted to leave the EU – a company, publishing their full or half year results, complains the subsequent drop in the pound has hit profits by pushing up their costs or eating into the disposable incomes of their customers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170905223913/http://news.sky.com/story/halfords-sales-driven-by-staycation-summer-11021633,"Halfords, the car parts and cycling accessories retailer, bucks that trend. Its trading update on Tuesday, which also marks the swansong for outgoing chief executive Jill McDonald, indirectly credits the drop in the pound for encouraging people to take ""staycations"" at home this summer. The company reported that during the 20 weeks to 18 August, sales were up by 4.8% on the same period last year. On the closely-watched like-for-like sales measure, which strips out any impact of store openings, closures or refurbishments, sales were up by a still-solid 2.8% - with sales in the cycling sub-category up by 5.2%. Ms McDonald, who leaves next month to become head of clothing, home and beauty at Marks & Spencer, said: ""I am pleased with the trading performance over the first 20 weeks of the year in both motoring and cycling. ""A combination of good planning and execution meant that we optimised sales from the staycation summer, with strong growth in camping, roof boxes and cycle carriers. ""This complemented our service-related retail sales, which grew significantly faster than our total sales, as we continue to demonstrate our relevance to the growing 'do it for me' customer."" The news, as related to the weaker pound, was not all good. Halfords, as it reminded investors, had previously warned that the weaker pound would leave it facing £25m in higher costs during the present financial year, £15m of it in the first half, although it is confident that, over time, it will be able to recover that. It insisted that its mitigation plans had been put in place. Most bikes sold in the UK are sourced in the Far East and are bought in dollars. However, this is a factor that will also hurt a lot of independent cycle retailers, which make up the majority of the 2,500 cycle shops in Britain. Halfords, with its superior buying power, should be able to ride out this turbulence better than the average local independent bike shop. There are a couple more points to make about this. The first is that a lot of the spending Halfords sees from customers is 'non-discretionary', in other words, it is spending about which customers have little choice. If your car needs a new set of windscreen wipers or your bike has a flat tyre, it is not something you can put off or save up for, it is a purchase you need to make immediately. However, it is clear Halfords has benefited from an upsurge in people staying at home, as shown by the strength of sales in camping equipment and roof boxes. Cycling, too, continues to go from strength to strength. While a lot of spending in this area is non-discretionary, the skill of the retailer lies in getting people to trade up or shell out more, which Halfords appears to have been doing. E-bikes, a line it has been pushing hard, are selling well. The retailer signed Victoria Pendleton, the former Olympic gold medallist, to design the Pendleton Somerby, a power-assisted bike, which it sells for £750 in more than 300 stores alongside other own-brand electric bikes. It will be interesting to see in coming weeks whether Halfords is an outlier. The chances are that it is not. Barclays Corporate Banking reported last month that one in three Britons planned to spend more holiday time at home this summer. Many of those benefiting from an uptick in staycations will be independent bed-and-breakfast providers. But the City will be looking out to see whether some of the larger hotel operators, such as Premier Inn, owned by Whitbread, have also enjoyed a sales boost. The same applies to the pub and restaurant trade. JD Sports, owner of Millets and Blacks, two other big camping equipment retail chains, could be another beneficiary. Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the weaker pound has attracted more foreign tourists to the UK. Barclays said 63% of international travellers were more interested in visiting the UK than they were a year earlier and that 31% of the 10,000 it surveyed cited the weaker pound as a reason for visiting. So, while the weaker pound has created a headache for some businesses, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good."

In a statement read in Newcastle Crown Court one of the victims said the men were ""monsters"" who got her addicted to drugs and said she no longer trusted men. Another said that she still had flashbacks to the parties six years ago where girls where given drugs and then persuaded or forced to have sex with different men. A third victim said the men thought ""they are superior to women, and girls do not have the same rights as men"". Heroin dealer Jahangir Zaman, 45, was convicted of raping a girl by forcing her to give him oral sex and sentenced to 29 years behind bars. He was also found guilty of conspiracy to incite prostitution, drugs offences and, following a separate police investigation, conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. Mohammed Azram, 35, was sentenced to 12-and-a-half years for causing sustained psychological damage to his victims, who thought he was a friend. Prosecutors said Azram, who picked up his victims from a courtyard in the city's west end, played a ""leading role"" in the scheme. One of his victims said he took her to a party where she saw another girl being treated like a slave. Prosecutors said: ""(The witness) described her as looking upset, she was dirty, the bedclothes were dirty, her clothes were ripped."" The court heard the men would drop things on the floor and make her pick them up. Azram admitted one count of sexual assault, one count of inciting prostitution and a number of drugs offences. A convicted child rapist was controversially employed by Northumbria Police to investigate the group. The informant was called XY and was paid £10,000 for his information. More members of the gang will be sentenced later this week."
2017-09-05,"Former US President Barack Obama has said Donald Trump's decision to roll back the ""dreamers"" programme is ""wrong"" and ""cruel"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170905223913/http://news.sky.com/story/obama-trump-immigration-decision-is-cruel-11022221,"In a long Facebook post made on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Obama said that the move was a ""political decision, and a moral question"" that was not required legally. ""We shouldn't threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us,"" he wrote. Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, giving a six month window for Congress to put forward an alternative. The scheme allows undocumented migrants who arrived in the United States as children to apply for permits to live and work legally in the USA. It was introduced by Barack Obama in 2012, but the former President had hoped to pass wider ranging legislation. An original proposal, the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) act, sought to grant permanent residency to those who had arrived illegally, but the DACA program was introduced as a compromise when that legislation failed to pass. Around 800,000 people currently live in the USA under the DACA program - many of whom have jobs, homes, families or are pursuing an education in the country - and are now at risk of deportation. Those who have been in the country since early childhood may not be protected from potential removal, often to countries they have not visited for years or even decades. Donald Trump has defended his decision, arguing that he is protecting American jobs and upholding the rule of law. It is now up to Congress to outline an alternative legislation that can offer the young migrants protection from deportation. Mr Obama called on lawmakers to ""protect these young people and our future"", in an unusual intervention for a politician who in the past has shied away from strident criticism of Mr Trump's policies. ""What if our kid's science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn't know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?"" Mr Obama wrote. ""What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals - that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will."""
2017-09-05,"Labour will vote against the Brexit repeal bill unless it is amended, saying the legislation allows ministers to ""grab power from Parliament"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170905223913/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-says-it-will-oppose-brexit-repeal-bill-over-power-grab-fears-11021738,"In a strongly worded statement, Labour said the bill, in its current form, would allow ministers to slash rights at work and cut protection for consumers and the environment. The statement came as Brexit Secretary David Davis prepares to deliver a statement in the House of Commons on divorce talks with the EU. Parliament will begin debating the EU withdrawal bill on Thursday and there will be a vote on Monday, testing Prime Minister Theresa May's Commons majority. Labour said last week that it wanted to keep Britain in the Single Market during a transition period after Britain's membership in the bloc ends in March 2019 - an alternative to the Conservative Government's stance. The Labour Party is expected to push for changes to the bill, which aims at ensuring that EU law no longer applies to Britain. ""Labour fully respects the democratic decision to leave the European Union, voted to trigger Article 50 and backs a jobs-first Brexit with full tariff-free access to the European single market,"" a Labour spokesperson said. ""But as democrats we cannot vote for a Bill that unamended would let Government ministers grab powers from Parliament to slash people's rights at work and reduce protection for consumers and the environment."" The statement went on to say: ""Nobody voted in last year's referendum to give this Conservative Government sweeping powers to change laws by the back door. ""The slogan of the Leave campaign was about people taking back control and restoring powers to Parliament. This power-grab bill would do the opposite."" Labour, which held a meeting of the shadow cabinet on Tuesday morning, hopes its stance will split the Tories. Mrs May is already facing a potential rebellion from Remain-supporting MPs within her own party, who might be tempted to back Labour's attempt to amend the bill. The PM has said the legislation is the best way to ensure Britain's successful exit from the EU. Some of the criticism, including from Tories, has focused on the so-called ""Henry VIII"" powers to change laws without full parliamentary scrutiny. The Government says Henry VIII powers in the legislation would not be used to make significant changes."

""Working as a nurse for 26 years, do the Tories expect our support in the light of another 1% pay rise?"" she challenged the Prime Minister. ""My wage slips from 2009 reflect exactly what I'm earning today, so how can that be fair in light of the job that we actually do?"" The PM responded, in an answer that was later widely criticised as ""callous and incompetent"", by declaring: ""There's no magic money tree."" Yet now, three months and a lost Commons majority later, it seems there is a magic money tree after all and the 1% cap will be soon be lifted. ""We know a number of people in the public and private sectors feel they are just about managing,"" said the Prime Minister's official spokeswoman this week. ""And we recognise the sacrifice they are making. But there is a process in place and I can't pre-empt the process."" The process is that the Government writes to pay review bodies for groups like nurses, other NHS staff, teachers, police and the armed forces making a recommendation. And the expectation is that these bodies will report back in time for the Chancellor's Budget - probably in late November - and Philip Hammond will announce the lifting of the cap with a flourish. (Or at least the nearest thing to a flourish that the often less-than-charismatic ""Spreadsheet Phil"" can manage. Though his supporters would say that's unkind!) Ever since the election - when many Tory MPs encountered hostility to the pay curbs on the doorstep during the campaign - the Chancellor has been under pressure to ""scrap the cap"". As you might expect, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been lobbying for more pay for nurses and Education Secretary Justine Greening for teachers. There are also powerful voices lobbying on behalf of the armed forces, including the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, who claims that if there was another operation like Iraq or Afghanistan it would struggle to recruit enough soldiers. So far, the clearest indication of the Government's latest thinking has come from Chris Grayling, who ran Mrs May's leadership election campaign last year and is now Transport Secretary. ""We of course listen to the lessons from the general election campaign,"" he said. ""But when it comes to these big financial decisions they are things that have to wait for the Budget."" It has been suggested that the Chancellor is annoyed about the Cabinet Office trying to ""bounce"" him into lifting the pay cap because it wants pay rises for civil servants. There is not much public sympathy for Whitehall mandarins when it comes to pay. But unions will, of course, point out that most civil servants are poorly paid and work in benefit offices and job centres a long way from Whitehall. When the cap is lifted - and it will be when, not if - the Government will emphasise its generosity to the most popular groups of public sector workers like nurses, police officers and the armed forces. That is because the Prime Minister - who now wants to lead the Tories into the 2022 general election - will not have forgotten her uncomfortable TV clash with Victoria Davey during the last election campaign."

In a statement on his blog Mr Hemming said there had been a ""concerted campaign"" against him involving his political opponents and ""many others"". He said the campaign had led to ""ill-founded vigilante attacks"" on both himself and his family. ""I am still in discussion with the police about some of the criminal incidents involving my family and myself during this process,"" he added. The accusations that led to the investigation were made by Esther Baker, who decided to waive her right to anonymity in an interview with Sky News in 2015. She made a series of allegations about the abuse she said she suffered in Staffordshire in the 1980s. The allegations included the claim that police officers had stood guard on Cannock Chase while VIPs abused her and other young children. Mr Hemming criticised Sky News' coverage of Ms Baker's claims. None of the men accused by Ms Baker were identified by Sky News. Mr Hemming said police had ""handled the allegations well"" but criticised them for taking two years to resolve the case. He said the current CPS guidelines on handling false allegations are ""too tolerant of malicious allegations and need review"". Staffordshire police described their investigation as ""thorough and sensitive"". In a statement they said: ""Throughout this process our priority has been to support Esther and ensure all potential lines of enquiry were carefully assessed and investigated. ""We recognise this investigation, and subsequent review by the CPS, has taken a great deal of time."" Superintendent Amanda Davies said: ""It was vital we gave the victim the time, space and support she needed to disclose the information. ""Over 100 hours of interviews were conducted by specially trained officers, and throughout the investigation we have kept her informed and continued to provide support. ""In this case Esther made the difficult decision to waive her right to anonymity and we will continue to support her, as we would with all victims of crime. ""We want to take this opportunity to reassure other potential victims that their identity is protected by law. ""Supporting victims remains our absolute priority, rest assured you can contact us confident that you will be listened to and we will provide the support you need.""

By lunchtime (UK time) on Tuesday, it had been upgraded from a category 4 to a category 5 storm. Hurricane Harvey, a category 4 storm at its strongest, had maximum sustained winds of 130mph just before it made landfall in Texas, and ended up leaving 30,000 people homeless. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is warning that Irma's winds could strengthen further in the next 48 hours as it approaches the Caribbean. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said the storm is currently out in the North Atlantic and only a few hundred miles east of the Leewards Islands, which include Montserrat, a British overseas territory, and Antigua. The latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center is that it will score a direct hit on the island of Barbuda at 2am AST (7am UK time) on Wednesday, followed by another direct hit on Anguilla, another British overseas territory, at 2pm AST (7pm) the same day. There is a chance it will go on to hit or pass very close to Florida at the weekend. It is expected to bring around half a metre of rain there. ""The initial threat of Irma is for the Leewards Islands through Tuesday night and early Wednesday,"" Ghaffar said. ""As it gets closer, dangerous storm surge and large breaking waves will make water levels rise and lead to coastal flooding. ""Worst-hit areas look likely to be the British and US Virgin Islands."" Forecasters have said Irma is a classic 'Cape Verde hurricane' which forms in the far eastern Atlantic near the Cape Verde Islands and then moves all the way across the Atlantic. Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne has ordered workers to clear drains and prune trees as branches could down power lines in strong winds. ""The passage of a hurricane is not a matter to be taken lightly, but we must not panic,"" he said. Governor of US territory Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, said 10-20cm of rain was expected, as well as winds of 40-50mph as he warned of flooding and power cuts. 8 am Special Advisory: #Irma is now a category 5 #hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) More: https://t.co/tW4KeGdBFb pic.twitter.com/QU1LWq7QsA A state of emergency was declared on the island, which has a population of about 3.4 million.

Her comments came after Russian leader Vladimir Putin said any new sanctions against North Korea because of its nuclear programme would be ""useless"" and ""ineffective"". Meanwhile, Donald Trump said on Twitter he is allowing Japan and South Korea to buy ""a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States"". I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States. Mr Trump has previously described North Korea as a ""great threat"" and ""very hostile and dangerous to the United States"". France's defence minister Ms Parly said in a speech: ""The scenario of an escalation towards a major conflict cannot be discarded. ""Europe risks being within range of (North Korean President) Kim Jong Un's missiles sooner than expected."" :: Mark Austin: Big threats from Trump benefit Kim Jong Un A report overnight said the North was moving what appears to be an intercontinental ballistic missile towards its west coast. South Korea's Asia Business Daily cited an intelligence source as saying the rocket was spotted moving on Monday, the day after Pyongyang's sixth and largest nuclear test. The North Korean missile programme's launch facilities are on its west coast - and the move was reportedly made during the night to avoid surveillance. :: How does H-bomb compare with atomic bomb? South Korea's defence ministry said it could not confirm the report, but it said on Monday its neighbour was ready to launch more missiles. In July, North Korea tested two ICBMs capable of flying about 6,200 miles, threatening parts of the US mainland. The closest European country to North Korea is Norway, which is a straight-line distance of around 3,900 miles away. But that doesn't take into consideration the fact that a missile would have to leave the atmosphere and return to earth. The minister's warning comes days after North Korea claimed to have carried out a hydrogen bomb test - estimated by South Korea to have been three times as powerful as the Hiroshima atomic bomb. One of North Korea's top diplomats said his country was ready to send ""more gift packages"" to the United States. Han Tae Song, North Korea's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, told a conference on disarmament: ""I am proud of saying that just two days ago on the 3rd of September, DPRK (North Korea) successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test for intercontinental ballistic rocket under its plan for building a strategic nuclear force. ""The recent self-defence measures by my country, DPRK, are a 'gift package' addressed to none other than the US,"" he added. ""The US will receive more 'gift packages' from my country as long as it relies on reckless provocations and futile attempts to put pressure on the DPRK,"" he concluded without elaborating. Theresa May's spokesperson told reporters the North Korea nuclear programme threatens the whole international community and the whole international community, including China, must work together to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions."

Elected in 1983, Adams, who turns 69 next month, is the longest-serving leader of any political party in the UK and Ireland. He said: ""At this event last year, Martin McGuinness made it clear that we had a plan for orderly leadership change. ""None of us knew that Martin would become terminally ill and that we would meet this year without him. Suffice to say we miss him deeply. ""It is our intention to unveil at the Ard Fheis (party conference) in November the plan that he helped to formulate. ""I will be allowing my name to go forward for the position of uachtaran (president) Sinn Fein. ""And if elected, I will be setting out our priorities and in particular our planned process of generational change, including my own future intentions."" In his address, he described Brexit as ""the most serious social, economic and political threat to the island of Ireland for a generation"". With Northern Ireland facing the prospect of a return to direct rule, he repeated Sinn Fein's position on attempts to restore devolution. ""There will be no return to the assembly or executive without a stand-alone Irish Language Act and agreement on the resolution of other outstanding issues."" Mr Adams, the world's most recognisable Irish republican, has long been a controversial figure in politics. Having grown up in a staunchly republican family, he became a political activist and was imprisoned without trial under the Special Powers Act. He has long denied IRA membership but was released from prison at the organisation's request to attend secret talks with the British Government in 1972. He strenuously denies allegations he sanctioned the 'Bloody Friday' bombings in Belfast, 20 attacks in one day which claimed the lives of 11 people. Brought in from the political cold in the early 1990s, Gerry Adams led Sinn Fein to negotiations resulting in the Good Friday Agreement. When the DUP and Sinn Fein emerged as the largest parties, he nominated his life-long friend Mr McGuinness to serve as deputy first minister. Mr Adams resigned as MP for Belfast West and won a seat in the Irish Parliament in 2011."
2017-09-05,Nicola Sturgeon will scrap the 1% cap on public sector pay rises in Scotland.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170905223913/http://news.sky.com/story/nicola-sturgeon-lifts-1-public-sector-pay-cap-in-scotland-11021804,"The First Minister insisted nurses, teachers, police officers and firefighters ""deserve a fairer deal for the future"" amid rising inflation. The SNP leader set out the pledge as she unveiled the Scottish Government's legislative programme for the coming year to MSPs. In May, a Labour motion on lifting the 1% cap on pay rises for nurses was defeated at Holyrood after SNP and Conservative MSPs voted against it. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the pay cap ""while never desirable"" was ""necessary to protect jobs and services"". ""However, with inflation on the rise, it is not sustainable,"" the First Minister added. ""Our nurses, teachers, police officers and firefighters deserve a fairer deal for the future. ""Indeed, the need to recruit the staff that our public services depend on also demands a new approach. ""We will therefore aim to secure pay rises from next year that are affordable, but which also reflect the real life circumstances our public servants face and the contribution our public services make to the overall prosperity of our country."" The First Minister's pledge will increase pressure on Theresa May to similarly lift the 1% per year cap on public sector pay rises for the rest of the UK. Following June's snap General Election, the Prime Minister has faced repeated calls, including from her own party, to ease austerity measures and lessen the restrictions on public sector pay. This week, Downing Street signalled the public sector pay cap, which has been in place since 2010, will be raised above inflation for the first time in eight years. Ministers are due to send out letters to the independent pay review bodies within weeks, in which they can offer guidance, and are understood to be preparing to back a lifting of the cap. Responding to Ms Sturgeon's announcement, Scottish Labour's interim leader Alex Rowley welcomed the lifting of the pay cap but warned ""it cannot be done on the back of cutting even more from public services"". John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance pressure group, said: ""Taking into account pensions, public sector workers earn 10% more than those in the private sector, and those private sector workers are the ones who will have to subsidise this spending increase."" Ms Sturgeon announced the Scottish Government will bring forward a total of 16 Bills in the coming year."
2017-09-05,As a diplomatic editor I am currently often asked whether we on the brink of nuclear war.   ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170905223913/http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-tensions-are-we-on-the-brink-of-nuclear-war-11021899,"As Hugo Rifkind reassured us in The Times on Tuesday, we are not if you mean global nuclear armageddon. We were in the 1980s as he says, but North Korea does not have the nuclear wherewithal to threaten apocalypse beyond the region. Not yet at least.But there is a significant risk of something catastrophic within the region and that should worry us all.Another columnist, Gideon Rachman in the Financial Times, points out that miscalculations and misunderstandings have led to conflict throughout history. :: North Korea 'could target Europe sooner than feared' That currently is the worry and it is a very real one. Imagine the next missile fired by North Korea does not fly over Japan but falls short and hits a residential area. Imagine it hits an American base. Either would demand a response. Donald Trump is already under enormous pressure from supporters back home to strike North Korea even without any of the above. He is also a beleaguered politician under an increasingly intrusive investigation with popularity ratings plummeting. The temptation to cause a distraction must already be almost irresistible. Any strike by the Americans or their allies is likely to be met with a disproportionate response from the North Koreans. Bad news for Seoul, the South Korean capital. Pyongyang has thousands of artillery pieces within range of Seoul and could devastate it if the North comes under attack or counterattack. Then there is that risk of a misunderstanding. :: Which countries trade with North Korea? North Koreans are reared on the constant threat of war with America. Propaganda about the warmongering West has propped up the Kim regime for decades. They are made to believe that America is itching to invade. Only the resolute determination of their dynasty of god-like rulers have saved them from this fate. In the current climate North Korea misreading US military movements could lead to rapid escalation and disaster. It is a far from remote possibility. We have no idea exactly what nuclear capability the North Koreans now possess. It may well have the power to lob a warhead as far as Japan, almost certainly the South. It does not need to have that good an aim to cause utter devastation. Backed into a corner, it is perfectly possible for the Kim regime to use it. We cannot either rule out the Trump administration using military action first. While the rest of the world seems on the verge of accepting the inevitability of a nuclear armed North Korea, for the US this is unacceptable. :: How does H-Bomb compare to atomic bomb? A sworn enemy with the power to strike its major cities, just imagine. US military strategists are currently weighing up the risks of that against the risks of some kind of pre-emptive action. Back in the 1980s those old enough will remember the background fear that the world could wipe itself out umpteen times. Hugo Rifkind is right to point out that eventually the danger passed. But Cold War scholars have since discovered how perilously close we came, a number of times through misunderstandings and miscalculations. Only cool heads on both sides and communication between them saved the day, and the world. The jeopardy this time is less global and more local. Quite local enough if you happen to live on or anywhere near the Korean Peninsula, of course. But there may not currently be the cool heads and communication channels required to avert a misunderstanding and de-escalate the situation."
2017-09-06,"Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, touted as a possible future leader of the Tory party, has said he is ""completely opposed"" to abortion, including in cases of rape or incest.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170906230818/http://news.sky.com/story/jacob-rees-mogg-completely-opposed-to-abortion-11022984,"In an interview that sparked an immediate backlash, the backbencher, a devout Catholic and father of six, also said he is opposed to same-sex marriage. Mr Rees-Mogg, dubbed the ""MP for the 18th Century"" for his unashamedly old-fashioned ways, has become an unlikely social media star in the summer, and has seen his popularity and profile rise. This week he topped a poll of Conservative supporters who named him the favourite to be next party leader. But he dismissed any talk of a bid: ""Let me be absolutely clear: I'm not a candidate. ""There is not a vacancy. I fully support Theresa May and want her to continue. And I'm a backbench MP."" However, it is his views on abortion that have drawn the most attention. Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said: ""I'm completely opposed to abortion. Life begins at the point of conception."" He added: ""With same-sex marriage, that is something that people are doing for themselves; with abortion it is something that is done to the unborn child."" Asked if he was opposed to abortion in all circumstances, including rape and incest, he said: ""Yes, I am. I'm afraid so. ""Life is sacrosanct and begins at the point of conception and I think it is wrong."" He said he was expressing his personal opinion and that he would not stop a woman from having an abortion because it is allowed under British law. On same-sex marriage, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""I'm a Catholic and I take the teaching of the Catholic Church seriously in matters of faith and morals. ""Marriage is a sacrament and the decision of what is a sacrament lies with the church, not with Parliament."" ""I don't want to criticise people who lead lives that are different to mine, but equally I don't want to divert from the historic teaching of the Catholic Church."" Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it was shocking such views would come from somebody seen as a potential Conservative party leader. ""The shocking thing is not really Jacob Rees-Mogg's personal views - he's entitled to them. ""The shocking thing is so many people in the Conservative Party seem to think he should be their next leader. I think that's an appalling thought."" The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said Mr Rees-Mogg's were ""wildly at odds"" with public opinion. It highlighted the decriminalisation earlier this year of abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, and MPs' support for extending abortion access for women in Northern Ireland. Katherine O'Brien, head of policy research at BPAS, said: ""We are a pro-choice country, we have a pro-choice Parliament. Rees-Mogg's stance on abortion is quite simply extreme and extremely out-of-touch."" Mr Rees-Mogg has emerged as the grassroots favourite to succeed Mr May. The North East Somerset MP topped a survey of party supporters conducted by ConservativeHome, getting 23% of the vote. Brexit Secretary David Davis came in second with 15%. However, 19% ticked the ""other"" box. The poll of 1,309 people is seen as a reliable barometer of the grassroots mood, though it can also shift quickly. Mrs May has said she intends to lead the Tories at the next election in 2022, though some of her own MPs are sceptical."

He had twice previously been saved from the axe by chief executive Mike Ashley's own voting rights. Sports Direct said he secured that majority at the AGM, which took place at Sports Direct's controversial Shirebrook warehouse site, though almost 47% still opposed him. Mr Ashley was not in attendance. He had blamed a diary clash. Former West Yorkshire Police chief constable and government drugs tsar Mr Hellawell has faced stinging criticism of his tenure amid continuing anger over corporate governance and treatment of staff. Institutional shareholders Royal London Asset Management, Standard Life Aberdeen and Hermes Investment - along with three shareholder advisory bodies - had voiced their opposition to his reappointment ahead of the meeting. Just over a dozen investors were understood to have attended the gathering in person. They were greeted by a Unite union-organised demonstration over working practices and the continued use of zero-hours contracts for casual staff, despite Sports Direct previously pledging to abolish them by offering guaranteed hours to all staff. It was an issue raised by the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at the first Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons since the conclusion of the summer recess. Mr Hellawell defended the use of the contracts at the AGM and said staff would not want to join the company if they were unhappy with the working conditions - rejecting calls for an independent review. He said: ""We say casual workers, you say zero-hours contracts. It is still a legal form of employment in this country. ""While that still is a legal form of employment we will choose if we wish to continue with that form of employment. ""A very large proportion of our workers are happy to maintain that flexibility."" Commenting on the result of the shareholder vote, Ashley Hamilton Claxton of Royal London said: ""With Keith Hellawell surviving his second shareholder revolt in a year by the skin of his teeth, we believe that the board should urgently address the long list of corporate governance concerns that have been raised by independent shareholders to help restore confidence in the board. ""Royal London has a duty to ensure its customers' money is invested in well-run companies with the best possible future prospects. In a statement ahead of the AGM to the London Stock Exchange, Sports Direct said its profit expectations for the current financial year were on track following a 59% drop in the previous 12 months. It had blamed media coverage of the pressures facing Sports Direct and currency headwinds for that performance but remained optimistic of achieving earnings growth of up to 15%. It said the company's new generation flagship stores were exceeding sales expectations and it had taken 100% control of luxury retailer Flannels. Sports Direct shares, which were trading above 900p each three years ago, were over 2% higher on the day at 393p on Wednesday."

The White House wants the UN Security Council to slap an oil embargo on the secretive state as well as hitting dictator Kim Jong Un with a travel ban and freezing his assets. The US, which has accused Kim of ""begging for war"", also believes there should be a ban on the country exporting textiles and the hiring of North Korean workers abroad. The proposed measures are contained in a draft resolution which the US wants the 15-member council to vote on this Monday. But Russia said that could be ""a little premature"". Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang escalated after the rogue nation claimed last Sunday it had detonated a hydrogen bomb - its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date. It said its test was a ""perfect success"" and the bomb was designed to be mounted on its newly-developed intercontinental ballistic missile. Mr Trump has urged China, which is the North's main trading partner and provides much of its oil supply, to put more pressure on Kim to limit his controversial nuclear programme. The US leader told reporters he has had a ""strong"" and ""frank"" phone conversation with China's President Xi Jinping about North Korea and said neither of them would put up with the rogue nation's provocative actions. The White House said both leaders were committed to taking ""further action"" aimed at ""denuclearising"" the Korean peninsula. Mr Trump did not rule out military strikes against Kim's secretive state, but indicated other options for pressure would come first. He said: ""President Xi would like to do something. We'll see whether or not he can do it. But we will not be putting up with what's happening in North Korea."" He added: ""I believe that President Xi agrees with me 100%. We had a very, very frank and very strong phone call."" President Xi told his US counterpart that Beijing remains committed to stopping the North's nuclear ambitions and maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. :: Sanctions on North Korea are 'useless' - Putin Sky's Washington Correspondent Mark Austin said: ""China fears tough sanctions could bring down the Kim regime and that would lead to chaos on its border. ""It's going to be very hard for Donald Trump to get China on side. There is no sign yet that they will back really tough sanctions."" Washington has rejected China's proposal for a freeze on the North's nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a suspension of US-South Korea military drills. :: Mark Austin: Big threats from Trump benefit Kim Jong Un A report in South Korea on Tuesday claimed Kim's regime was seen moving what appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile towards its west coast. Analysts say it is most likely the secretive state will carry out its next ""provocative"" act on or around 9 September when the country celebrates its founding day."

Lawyers have described the Bill, which Jeremy Corbyn has ordered Labour MPs to vote against, as the biggest change in the UK's legal system for 45 years. Opponents, including some pro-Remain Tory MPs, claim it is a power grab by the Government. But the Prime Minister, who will be on the Government's front bench for the debate, says it is about delivering Brexit. ""The Repeal Bill helps deliver the outcome the British people voted for by ending the role of the EU in UK law, but it's also the single most important step we can take to prevent a cliff-edge for people and businesses, because it provides legal certainty,"" she said. The 66-page Bill is dominated by three major measures: :: Repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act, the legislation which took Britain into the Common Market :: Transfer of EU laws into UK law so they continue to apply after Brexit :: Giving ministers the power to change old EU laws once they are part of UK lawOpening the Commons debate, which concludes with a vote next Monday, the Brexit Secretary will promise to work with MPs as well as welcoming scrutiny and debate on the Bill at its second reading and then in its committee stage. ""In bringing forward this Bill, we are ensuring the smoothest possible exit from the EU - an exit that enables the continued stability of the UK's legal system, and maximises certainty for business, consumers and individuals across the UK,"" Mr Davis will say. ""We are not rejecting EU law, but embracing the work done between member states in over 40 years of membership and using that solid foundation to build on in the future, once we return to being masters of our own laws. ""I hope everyone in this House recognises this Bill's essential nature - it is the foundation upon which we will legislate for years to come - and I look forward to working with the whole House to deliver the Bill."" It is the third part of the Bill, a so-called Henry VIII clause, that has prompted Mr Corbyn and his shadow cabinet to confirm that Labour MPs will be ordered to vote against it at second reading. The Commons debate follows Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions in which Mrs May was forced to adopt a conciliatory tone towards the pro-Remain Tory MP and leading Brexit rebel Anna Soubry, who signalled she is prepared to lead a backbench rebellion. Twisting the stiletto, the former minister warned the PM of ""very serious concerns"" on Conservative benches the Bill could become an ""unprecedented and unnecessary Government power grab"". In a sign of her apparent weakness on this legislation, due to her lack of a Commons majority, Mrs May could not have been more friendly towards Ms Soubry, promising to meet her and any other Tory MP to hear their concerns. But the Prime Minister will have been relieved Mr Corbyn, in his six questions at PMQs, chose to ignore both Brexit and the leaked bombshell Home Office document, which revealed plans for a tough crackdown on unskilled EU migrants after exiting the EU. Instead, Mr Corbyn launched an attack on the PM on public sector pay, zero hours contracts, pay and conditions at McDonald's and Sports Direct, and ""dumped Tory manifesto promises"". Some Labour MPs claimed their leader avoided both Brexit and immigration because his party's own position is ambiguous and is also split on immigration. Others suggested Mr Corbyn has only ordered his Labour MPs to vote against the EU (Withdrawal) Bill because he knows he does not have the numbers to defeat the Government at the second reading vote next Monday evening. It was left to the Scottish National Party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, to challenge Mrs May on immigration, with the PM responding by defiantly defending the Government's plans for post-Brexit controls."

He was forced to miss the US Open, currently taking place in New York, and was visibly struggling when he was eliminated from Wimbledon in July. Murray has confirmed he will definitely miss upcoming tournaments in the far east and probably the season's last two events in Vienna and Paris. Writing on Facebook, he said: ""Just wanted to update you all on my injury and the rest of my season. ""Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in the upcoming events in Beijing and Shanghai, and most likely, the final two events to finish the season in Vienna and Paris due to my hip injury which has been bothering me the last few months.

The world number two admits it has been a ""frustrating year on court,"" but says he is confident ""I will be able to reach my best level again and be competing for Grand Slam titles next season"". Murray started the year as world number one, but he has won only one title and failed to progress further than the last eight at any of the Grand Slams. Entering Wimbledon as defending champion in July, he rarely found his best form and was clearly struggling in his quarter-final defeat to American Sam Querrey. The three-time Grand Slam winner spent the following six weeks trying to regain fitness in time for the US Open. But after testing out his hip during a week of training at Flushing Meadows, he conceded defeat and withdrew from the competition after the draw had been made. Murray, who is Britain's most successful tennis player in the open era, says he will begin his 2018 season in Brisbane in preparation for the Australian Open in January."

It also expresses confidence in the future of ""a global Britain"" and says that the Government's Repeal Bill will ""make Britain ready for life outside the EU"". Executives in sectors including financial services, manufacturing and technology are among those approached about signing the letter, which is expected to be published as early as Thursday Sources at some of the UK's biggest businesses expressed incredulity at the request from No 10, which comes at a time when Theresa May's relationship with the private sector is already under strain. That tension was reinforced on Wednesday when leaked details of the Government's future immigration policy proposals were criticised by an array of business groups. One source who has seen the draft said it was reminiscent of the 'Project Fear' campaign that pro-remain supporters were accused of conducting before the EU referendum. The identity of the officials responsible for circulating the draft letter was unclear on Wednesday, or whether Mrs May was aware of the plan to release it. Sources said the approach from officials had been accompanied by a request to sign it before the end of the week. It is possible that a final version of the letter could differ from the draft seen by Sky News, said one source. The letter reads: ""We write as leaders of some of the UK's most dynamic businesses operating in sectors as diverse as technology, financial services and advanced manufacturing. ""Some of us personally supported the remain or leave campaigns at last year's referendum on EU membership, others did not make their positions public. ""But fifteen months later, we all share an understanding that Brexit is happening, a commitment to ensure that we make a success of the outcome for the whole country, and a confidence that a global Britain has the potential to become one of the most productive economies of the 21st century. ""This month the Government's Repeal Bill will initiate a programme of legislation that will make Britain ready for life outside the EU. ""We believe this is a good time for employers to work with Government and Parliament to make a success of Brexit and secure a bright future for our country. ""We welcome the Government's commitment to negotiating an interim period so that firms can ensure they are ready to adapt to the changing relationships and thrive under the new partnership being created with the EU. ""And as the UK makes progress towards establishing stronger trading links with markets like the US, India, Japan and Mexico, British businesses who know these markets well should stand ready to use their expertise and networks to cement future relationships. ""As business leaders, we have a duty to our shareholders and employees to continue to grow our businesses and ensure that they remain strong. ""As part of this we are also determined to see the UK continue to be a prosperous and united force for good in the world and are ready to play our full part to achieve this as Britain leaves the European Union."" Several FTSE 100 executives expressed incredulity at the approach from Downing Street, with one saying: ""There is no way we could sign this given the current state of chaos surrounding the (Brexit) talks."" Contact between ministers and the private sector has been intensified since June's general election, with regular meetings now scheduled between various groups involving Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, and Greg Clark, Business Secretary. Mrs May has also reintroduced a version of the business advisory group which met frequently under David Cameron. During Mr Cameron's premiership, letters from company bosses were often used during election and referendum campaigns to back the Conservatives or the Government's position. However, no such letter appeared from Tory-supporting bosses during this year's general election campaign, reflecting Mrs May's perceived disdain for enlisting the support of company bosses. None of the companies contacted by Sky News would comment, while a Downing Street spokesman declined to comment."

Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Kering, added: ""We hope to inspire the entire industry to follow suit, thus making a real difference in the working conditions of fashion models industry-wide."" Last year, a Gucci advert was banned by Britain's advertising watchdog because it featured a model leaning up against a wall who appeared ""unhealthily thin"" and ""gaunt"". Gucci told the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) the advert was aimed at an older, sophisticated audience and that it felt the model appeared ""toned and slim"". However, the ASA concluded the ad was ""irresponsible""."
2017-09-06,"Women can wait up to a decade before being diagnosed with endometriosis, a health watchdog has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170906230818/http://news.sky.com/story/endometriosis-must-be-diagnosed-more-quickly-health-watchdog-11022636,"As many as one in 10 UK women of reproductive age are affected by the painful and debilitating condition, making it the UK's second-most-common gynaecological condition, yet on average women wait seven and half years for diagnosis from when symptoms begin. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has called for endometriosis sufferers to be diagnosed in a shorter time and has issued guidance telling GPs not to overlook the signs of the condition. Endometriosis occurs when tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found in other parts of the body, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, parts of the stomach, bladder and bowel. It can cause large cysts, chronic pelvic pain, pain during or after sex, painful bowel movements, fatigue and heavy periods, and possible fertility problems. There is no cure for endometriosis and the exact cure is unknown. NICE says sufferers and those suspected of having the condition should have access to gynaecologists, pain management specialists and fertility services and that health professionals become aware of the physical and psychological impact of the condition and need for long-term treatment. NICE also says that endometriosis should not be excluded as a possible diagnosis, even if initial examination or scans appear normal and instead to refer patients for further investigation. Vickie Williams suffers from endometriosis and told Sky News that it took a decade for her to be diagnosed after she first experienced symptoms at the age of 11. She said: ""It really is awful when that pain comes, it feels like someone's got a hammer and they're thudding on your pelvis. ""I've come home and been rolling around on the floor - I've had to cancel plans, I've had anxiety, and no one really understands it because they can't see it."" There is no known cure for endometriosis, and the exact cause is still unknown. Chief executive of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Lone Hummelshoj said that, while the new guidance is welcome, more research still needs to be done. ""We need to collect clinical and surgical data that is comparable between all endometriosis centres and academic settings. ""Similar consistent data collection in breast cancer has resulted in a better understanding of how to treat different sub-types of breast cancer and to provide a prognosis to sufferers."""
2017-09-06,Nurses and civil servants have piled fresh pressure on the Government to lift the 1% cap on public sector pay rises.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170906230818/http://news.sky.com/story/nurses-and-civil-servants-pile-pressure-on-pm-over-public-sector-pay-cap-11023267,"Thousands of nurses demonstrated against the cap outside Parliament on Wednesday, while the UK's largest civil service trade union announced it would ballot members over possible strike action in protest against the restrictions. Amid increasing calls for the pay cap to be ditched, Downing Street has not denied reports the Government is considering scrapping the limit, which has been in place since 2010, later this year. Theresa May was tackled over the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urging ministers to ""see sense and end the public sector pay cap"" amid staff shortages. In reply, Mrs May praised those ""doing a good job for us day in and day out in often what are very difficult and harrowing circumstances"". She said the Government would ""balance"" the ""need to protect public sector workers"" and be ""fair to those paying for it"" when it sets out a framework for public sector pay for 2018/19 this autumn. The Prime Minister also noted two pay review body reports for police and prison officers are still to be published and will receive a Government response in 2017/18. Mrs May then attacked Mr Corbyn for ""consistently"" asking for ""more money to be spent on this, that and the other"". She added: ""He can do that in opposition because he knows he doesn't have to pay for it. ""The problem with Labour is that they do it in government as well."" Mr Corbyn quipped the Prime Minister ""had no problems finding £1bn to please the DUP"" following her post-election deal with the Northern Ireland party. He added: ""NHS staff are 14% worse off than they were seven years ago. Are you really happy that NHS staff use food banks? ""Warm words don't pay food bills - pay rises will help to do that. You must end the public sector pay cap."" After the exchanges, Mrs May's spokesman insisted the Prime Minister had not been describing spending on public sector wages as ""this, that and the other"" but had been talking about other Labour spending commitments. Nicola Sturgeon lifts 1% public sector pay cap in Scotland Pay cap: PM seems to have found 'magic money tree' Public sector pay cap 'to be lifted next year' In Westminster's Parliament Square, nurses protested as part of a campaign by the Royal College of Nursing, which has warned of industrial action if the cap is not removed. Guest speaker Sir Tony Robinson, the former Blackadder actor and Labour activist, told the crowd: ""We don't want any more weasel words, we don't want any dodging, we don't want any lying. ""We all have a cunning plan: scrap the cap now."" The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents civil servants, announced it would ballot members for industrial action in protest over the cap. They demanded the ""unjust"" cap is scrapped and replaced with pay rises of at least 5% for all public sector workers."

2017-09-06,The Prime Minister has called for recognition of the impact of a drug that allegedly caused deformities to babies in the womb. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170906230818/http://news.sky.com/story/primodos-pm-says-we-need-to-recognise-impact-of-deformity-drug-11023269,"Primodos was given to women by GPs in the 1960s and 70s as a pregnancy test. A Sky News investigation earlier this year uncovered that research from archives in Berlin which showed the drug had a one-in-five risk of causing birth defects - but that evidence of this was covered up in order to frustrate claimants. Campaigners have welcomed what is the most significant intervention by a Prime Minister on this issue in the past 50 years. Theresa May was responding to a question from Mims Davies. The Conservative MP for Eastleigh said: ""In the 1960's and 70's thousands of women were prescribed Primodos as a pregnancy test. ""This resulted in profound effects for the babies that followed, including my constituent Charlotte Fenceham, who cares as the sister alongside elderly parents for her brother Stephen who was profoundly affected. ""Does the Prime Minister agree with me that those families do now deserve justice and there should be a chance to launch a public inquiry into this terrible scandal?"" The Prime Minister responded: ""My honourable friend has raised an important issue and she is absolutely right to do so. ""And we should recognise the impact that this had on those women who took this hormone pregnancy test during pregnancy from the late 1950's into the 1970's. I think 1978 was the last time. ""There is an expert working group which has been set up, which is looking into this issue, which is due to publish its findings in the autumn, but I would be very happy to meet my honourable friend to discuss this issue with her."" It comes as MPs have called for a public inquiry. The expert working group run by the MHRA is due to release its report on Hormone Pregnancy Tests (HPTs) in October. The Sky News documentary broadcast in March found that alarms had been raised about Primodos, but not headed by the manufacturer and British regulatory authorities. We also discovered that the drug was used in some countries to induce abortions. Our report also highlighted a multi-million dollar settlement in America to a family in Wyoming who had used a very similar drug. Families in the UK have campaigned for justice for over 40 years and a legal challenge in 1982 failed to get off the ground due to a lack of conclusive evidence. However, new research conducted in Aberdeen on fish embryos appears to show that the drug can affect the growth of limbs, spinal cord and other aspects of embryo development in fish. The drug manufacturer Schering, now owned by Bayer, has always denied a causal link between Primodos and deformities caused to babies in the womb. Responding to the Prime Minister's Comments, Marie Lyon, chair of the Association For Children Damaged By Hormone Pregnancy Tests, told Sky News: ""The response from the Prime Minister is very welcome and recognises the battle we have had to publicly reveal the vast amounts of evidence about the dangers of HPTs. ""I would be happy to share this evidence with the PM."""
2017-09-06,An influential group of pro-Brexit Tory MPs is insisting the UK legally does not owe the EU a penny on exit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170906230818/http://news.sky.com/story/pro-brexit-tory-mps-insist-uk-legally-doesnt-owe-eu-a-penny-11023504,"The Conservative European Research Group (ERG), which numbers around 100 MPs, is backing a new report that claims the EU will in fact owe Britain £9.3bn after Brexit. Known for organising their efforts via a WhatsApp group, the ERG is thought to have helped shape the Government's approach to Brexit since the EU referendum. The analysis of Britain's possible financial settlement with the EU, by Dover MP Charlie Elphicke and EU law specialist Martin Howe QC, states there is a ""powerful"" legal case for the UK to depart the bloc without paying anything. It argues member states must have known there was a chance Britain could quit the EU when they agreed budgets lasting until 2020 - because ex-prime minister David Cameron had already announced his plan for an in-out EU referendum before the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) was agreed in 2014. As part of the Brexit negotiations, the EU is insisting Britain meet its existing spending commitments as part of a divorce bill, with Brussels demanding a reported total of €100bn (£91bn). The report suggests this demand is ""devoid of merit as a matter of international law"" and also sets out a ""compelling"" argument for the UK to receive a share of EU assets on exit, including a €10.2bn (£9.3bn) payout from the European Investment Bank. It argues the EU cannot demand Britain continues to pay for items such as Brussels officials' pensions unless it concedes there are EU assets the UK is entitled to. However, the document - which focuses on the EU's headline demands but admits there could be other UK liabilities - does concedes there would be ""value"" in making some form of exit payment to ""speed things along"". Mr Elphicke, an ERG officer, said: ""The EU is trying to blackmail Britain into handing over billions of pounds. ""Yet this detailed analysis shows that legally we owe the EU nothing. In fact, it turns out they owe us €10bn. ""The Government should stand firm and not be blackmailed into a multi-billion pound divorce bill."" Fellow Tory MP Suella Fernandes, the ERG's chair and also Parliamentary Private Secretary to Treasury ministers, hailed an ""impressive piece of work"" that exposes the EU's ""weak"" claims. Mr Howe, a member of the pro-Brexit Lawyers for Britain group, said: ""In law, we will owe no money at all to the EU when we leave, with some small items being more than cancelled out by the value of the UK's shareholding in the European Investment Bank."" The ERG's intervention comes amid an impasse between the UK and EU over the Brexit bill, with the latest round of negotiations offering no sign of agreement. Brussels has insisted the UK makes ""sufficient progress"" on its financial settlement - as well as the Irish border issue and rights of EU citizens in Britain - before talks can move on to discussions over the future EU-UK trade relationship. The Government recently dismissed claims Theresa May has secretly agreed a Brexit bill of up to £50bn."

Teachers hope it will make things ""fairer for transgender pupils and eliminate complaints over the decency of short skirts"". The updated uniform, which the school website says ""has been designed specifically in response to the many issues and suggestions raised by parents, students and school staff"", also rectifies the issue of boys having to wear ties while girls do not. It comprises grey trousers, white shirt, navy jumper and a blue and silver tie. Headteacher Tony Smith told the Brighton Argus newspaper: ""Specifically, it addresses the current issues of inequality and decency. ""Another issue was that we have a small but increasing number of transgender students and therefore having the same uniform is important for them."" However, one local mother who was not in favour, told the local newspaper: ""My daughter said she has got a gender and it's female, so being gender neutral when she has got a gender is a big deal for her, as she is proud to be a girl."""

During the EU referendum campaign, Ms Davidson was a staunch Remain supporter and famously clashed with Vote Leave figurehead Boris Johnson in a TV debate. In an interview with the New Statesman, the MSP conceded Brexit ""is going to happen"" but warned of the possible effect of the UK's departure from the EU. ""My real fear is that if there's a short-term economic hit, we don't bounce back from it,"" she said. Last week, Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier shared a tense news conference in Brussels following the latest round of talks. Ms Davidson regretted how the UK Government failed to ""pitch-roll"" the start of negotiations. ""I don't think the country was prepared for this period that we're currently in,"" she said. ""People in a room talking and then walking out and up to a bank of microphones and saying entirely different things while standing next to each other is part of what negotiation is."" Ms Davidson has been regularly touted as a future Conservative leader - and perhaps Prime Minister - should she move from Edinburgh down to Westminster. But Ms Davidson spoke of her aim to replace Nicola Sturgeon as Scotland's First Minister in 2021. And - despite her fears over Brexit - she praised current party leader Theresa May as ""absolutely straight down the line"" and ""not a game player"". The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""What we are working hard on is making sure we deliver the smoothest possible Brexit that delivers certainty for business and we get a trade deal that works for Britain and the EU, and we are confident of doing so."""

He announced announced three independently audited reviews - into presenter pay, representation and diversity, as well as a report on the gender pay gap, and an audit on equal pay. This comes after a report published in July showed its best paid presenters were mainly white and male. There were no Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic (BAME) stars featured in the list of 24 staff earning more than £300,000. The figures revealed 17 men earned over £300,000, compared with seven women.

But while his parents planned to drop him off at the gates, it now appears Kate may be kept at home by hyperemesis gravidarum, the severe sickness associated with her new pregnancy. George is thought to be among the youngest in his year, and is expected to have a gentle first day at his new school, where 560 pupils between the ages of four and 13 are educated. The school's website says its most important rule is to ""be kind"", and its fees start at £17,604 a year for each child. Grace Moody-Stuart, from the Good Schools guide, said pupils at the elite institution would be introduced to specialist subject teaching ""from the word go"", adding that she considered it a good choice for confident Prince George. ""The children need to be independent, really organised, pretty robust, and outgoing,"" she said. ""So I wouldn't necessarily think that it was the right school for a very shy or retiring child."" But others, including writer and broadcaster Rachel Johnson, have criticised the exclusive choice. ""I think as modernising royals they had a golden opportunity to break the mould and also do something to address the educational apartheid system that we have in this country, which sees the educated elite go to the top universities and then take the top jobs,"" she said. It is understood a decision over whether the Duchess of Cambridge will accompany George to his new school will be made in the morning. The Palace revealed on Monday that the Duchess was pregnant with her third child, and suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum as she had in previous pregnancies. The condition - sometimes referred to as extreme morning sickness - causes severe vomiting. It affects 3.5 pregnant women in 1,000 and the frequency of sickness it causes can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build up a toxins in blood or urine. Treatments include placing sufferers on a drip, but it is not generally considered to threaten long-term consequences for mother or baby. The Duchess suspended all Royal engagements as a result of the illness, for which she has previously been hospitalised. She said she is not sure her son ""has any idea what's going to hit him"" on his first day of school."

HSBC said it would no longer work with the firm, while fellow communications firm Chime confirmed it ""no longer had a stake in Bell Pottinger"" - writing-off the value of its 27% holding after failing to find a buyer. At least four major clients, including Investec, are also understood to have ditched Bell Pottinger's services over the racism row. The agency's future looks uncertain, with it confirming on Wednesday that it had hired accountancy firm BDO ""to look at all options for the business including a possible sale"". The firm's troubles began when South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), complained about the PR company's campaign for Oakbay Capital - an investment holding firm run by the billionaire Gupta family - which portrayed opponents of President Jacob Zuma as agents of ""white monopoly capital"" and coined slogans of ""economic apartheid"". Mr Zuma and the Guptas - accused of wielding undue political influence over the South African government - have always denied any wrongdoing in their relations. An investigation by the UK's Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) found the campaign was likely to ""inflame racial discord"" in the country. The PRCA, which represents 400 businesses and 20,000 individuals, on Tuesday banned the London-based agency from its membership for at least five years - the harshest sanction in its history. PRCA director general Francis Ingham condemned the firm's work on the South Africa contract as ""reprehensible"". ""The view of the PRCA board was that Bell Pottinger's actions were deliberately intended to create exactly the result they did - stirring up racial hatred in a very sensitive area of the world,"" he said. In a statement, Bell Pottinger said it accepted there were lessons to be learned, but disputed ""the basis on which the ruling was made"". It said the South Africa campaign was not representative ""of the way it works in general"" and it would continue to abide by the PRCA's code of ethics."

Everyone else will only be able to carry the smaller size bag, such as a handbag or laptop bag. Wheelie-style cases, that all customers could previously put in overhead lockers, will now be placed free in the hold at the boarding gate. Ryanair said it had taken the decision because flights were being delayed because of a shortage of locker space. Well done! Good decision! As a passenger who takes a backpack as hand luggage, I'm sick of people who take large bags and use all the space Great idea. I always put my hand luggage in the hold just before I get on. Much easier than fighting for a space in the cabin. Also from 1 November, the weight allowance for checked-in bags will increase from 15kg to 20kg, but the price drops from £35 to £25. Customers with infants will still be able to take an additional changing bag (5kg) on board with them. Passengers with waivers for medical items will also be able to board with them if they contact the airline's special assistance line in advance. Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said he hoped the changes would ""speed up the boarding of flights and eliminate flight delays"". He said: ""We believe offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage more customers to consider checking-in a bag, which will reduce the high volume of customers we have with two carry-on bags at the boarding gates - which is causing flight delays due to large numbers of gate bag and cabin bag offloads."" Good for long flights. Not good for flights under 1 hour long. Wait for bags may be longer than flight. As a frequent flyer, not happy. What a shame! I loved being able to bring my small wheelie and my handbag to not be held up on arrival waiting for my bag to arrive :( There was a mixed reaction to the reduced baggage allowance for non-priority boarders with some travellers on social media slamming the move, while others hailed it a step in the right direction. One angry Twitter user wrote: ""Good for long flights. Not good for flights under 1 hour long. Wait for bags may be longer than flight. As a frequent flyer, not happy."" Another said: ""What a shame! I loved being able to bring my small wheelie and my handbag to not be held up on arrival waiting for my bag to arrive :(."" However, some welcomed the action, tweeting: ""Well done! Good decision!

Hi Darren, It can be added after booking (for €/£6) up to 1 hour before the scheduled flight departure time, via the Ryanair app. So I cant add priority for the discounted rate? So now you want to charge me more for an option I would have taken if known about changes?? The new baggage policy applies to all bookings made before and after 1 November. ""If i'd known about change when I booked I would have added priority boarding as I like both bags with me, undamaged,"" wrote one angry passenger in a Twitter exchange with the airline's social media team. When he learned he would have to pay the higher rate of €6/£6 - not the discounted booking rate - if he now wanted to upgrade to a priority seat, he added: ""We are being penalised by your policy change yet you state customers are getting a BETTER deal."""

The most powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricane ever recorded has been causing havoc in the Caribbean, including the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, which are being hit by winds up to 185mph. At least six people have been killed on the island of St Martin, according to Guadeloupe prefect Eric Maire. St Barts and Barbuda also reported casualties. Another hurricane, Jose, is also heading for the Caribbean and tropical storm Katia was upgraded to a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Irma is on a path towards the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba before possibly heading for Florida over the weekend, but its precise direction is uncertain. Florida governor Rick Scott said it could be more devastating than 1992's Hurricane Andrew, a category five storm that is the most destructive ever to hit the state. The eye of Irma first roared over Barbuda, also hitting the nearby island of Antigua. St Barts and St Martin were next to be struck, as low-lying areas flooded, according to the French weather office. :: IRMA LIVE: Latest updates as Caribbean islands hunker down All government buildings on the French-run side of the island of St Martin had been destroyed, according to French interior minister Gerard Collomb. ""We know that the four most solid buildings on the island have been destroyed which means that more rustic structures have probably been completely or partially destroyed,"" he told reporters. French overseas territories minister Annick Girardin said Irma had caused ""major damage"" on several islands. According to some weather experts, the hurricane covers an area bigger than the UK and Ireland. The weather station on St Barts measured winds of 151mph before its monitoring equipment was destroyed by the storm. ""We are hunkered down and it is very windy... So far, some roofs have been blown off,"" said Garfield Burford from Antigua and Barbuda's ABS TV and Radio. Most people were without power and around 1,000 people on Antigua were spending the night in shelters, Mr Burford said. ""It's very scary... most of the islands are dark, so it's very, very frightening,"" he added. The wind sent debris flying as people huddled in their homes, many of which do not have concrete foundations and only wooden roofs. Tourists in the area were evacuated on Tuesday before the hurricane arrived. British Airways sent an empty aircraft to the region, bringing 326 customers back to the UK, and a Virgin Atlantic flight left Antigua five hours early to avoid the storm. The Foreign Office said Britons should follow the advice of authorities and heed evacuation orders. President Trump has declared emergencies in Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

""The DNA tests show that Pilar Abel is not Dali's daughter,"" the foundation said in a statement, adding that it was happy the ""absurd"" claim had been resolved. Ms Abel persuaded a Spanish judge to order the exhumation of Dali's remains in July, believing she was his illegitimate offspring. Forensic experts removed hair, nails and two long bones. Born in 1956, she claimed she was the result of an extra-marital affair her mother had with the married artist while working as a maid in his household during the 1950s. :: 2012: Man steals Dali artwork in a bag The psychic, who claimed she was entitled to part of his huge estate, had a DNA test herself, saying her priority was to be recognised as Dali's daughter and change her name to Dali. ""I want to know who I am. That is what I hope for. To know the truth,"" she said at the time. A court spokesman said the court has not made the test results public, but has informed the parties in the case. The painter's remains will be returned to his coffin, which is buried in the Dali Museum Theater in the northeastern Spanish town of Figueres, Dali's birthplace. Dali was one of the most famous artists from the 20th century surrealist period, painting pictures like the melting clocks in the 1931 work The Persistence Of Memory. He married his wife, Gala, in 1934, and the couple remained together up until her death in 1982. :: Stolen Dali returned by post They had no children and after his death in 1989, aged 84, he left his estate to the Spanish state. Famous for his long, waxed moustache, he was known for outrageous behaviour such as giving lectures in an old-fashioned deep-sea diving suit and driving from Spain to Paris in a white Rolls Royce filled with cauliflowers."

This is the first time UK universities have held first and second spots in the ranking's 13-year history. The UK universities stand above US institutions the California Institute of Technology and Stanford University, which share third place. However, the top two spots mask the general fall in UK university performance. Although 31 UK universities secured a position in the top 200, 16 of them saw a fall in performance compared to last year. The rankings, made up of 1,000 universities in 77 countries, are based on 13 measures grouped into five categories: teaching, research, citations, international outlook and industry income. The authors explained that although the top spaces were ""extremely tight"", Oxbridge's success was due to a sharp increase in their industry income. Oxford saw a 24% rise and Cambridge 11%, while US rivals saw a fall in such income. But rankings director Phil Baty warned that UK universities' income could fall in light of Brexit. A fifth of Oxford's and a quarter of Cambridge's research income is made up of EU grants, an amount that could affect the performance of the UK's top universities when Brexit has taken place. ""The data shows UK universities are consistently producing ground-breaking new research which is driving innovation,"" Mr Baty said.

It has made progress - announcing last month its first quarterly growth in almost three years after struggling to contain a stampede of shoppers to discount challengers such as Aldi and Lidl. Asda said the job losses reflected the need for its office functions to adapt to the demands of shoppers. Those affected by the cull were asked earlier on Wednesday to leave their posts immediately while the remaining 800 staff at the two locations affected have had their job descriptions changed. A spokesperson said: ""In recent years, the competitive landscape in retail has changed significantly and Asda has been no different. ""Our stores have adapted the way they operate to meet the changing needs of our customers, and our home offices must also adapt how they operate to support our stores. ""Today we are making some significant changes to the way we operate our home offices. As you'd expect, we have discussed the details of these changes with our colleagues first. ""These changes impact around 1,100 roles across Asda House in Leeds and George House in Leicester, and sadly result in around 300 colleagues leaving us. ""At Asda we value each and every one of our colleagues. The changes are in response to the ever changing sector in which we're working and the need to adapt to create an agile business which is fit for the future."" Asda's decision to shake-up its office functions follows the loss of similar jobs at the rest of the big four. The likes of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda have lost market share to their discount rivals. A resulting price war has become strained in more recent times as chains juggle rising costs from imported goods - a consequence of the Brexit-hit pound. :: UK produce helps keep lid on inflation It has meant more costs being passed on to consumers at a time they can least afford them as wage growth lags the pace of inflation. However, there is strong evidence to suggest some price rises are being absorbed by stores - anxious not to lose customers while a recent industry report suggested a partial recovery in sterling's value had eased some of the pain. Mr Clarke is reportedly considering taking further cost out of the business through plans to tackle 18 under-performing stores."

Mrs May told the Commons at Prime Minister's Questions that immigration to the country had been good overall, but people want to see tighter controls on migrants with Brexit. ""That's I think what people want to see as a result of coming out of the EU,"" the PM said. ""We continue to believe as a Government that it's important to have net migration at sustainable levels. ""We believe that to be in the tens of thousands because of the impact particularly it has on people at the lower end of the income scale in depressing their wages."" It was the first PMQs since the summer recess, coming just hours after the potentially explosive document was leaked to the Guardian newspaper. There was no mention of Brexit in the exchanges between Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn. However, the Prime Minister was taken to task by SNP MP Ian Blackford, who asked her to apologise for a ""disgraceful"" Home Office error which saw 100 EU nationals receiving deportation notices over the summer. Mrs May said the error should not have happened and added that ""every single one of those individuals was telephoned with an apology"". Ian Blackford asks if PM agrees immigration ""is essential to the strength of the UK economy"". PM says ""overall immigration has been good"" pic.twitter.com/jmqd4CJ5JP Under detailed proposals drawn up by Home Office officials, Britain will end Brussels' free movement of labour rules immediately after Brexit and introduce restrictions to deter all but highly skilled EU workers. ""Put plainly, this means that, to be considered valuable to the country as a whole, immigration should benefit not just the migrants themselves but also make existing residents better off,"" said the 82-page document, marked ""draft - official sensitive."" It proposes that while highly-skilled workers could get a work permit lasting three to five years, lower skilled workers may only be allowed to work in Britain for two years to limit the number ""of EU citizens able to come to the UK"". The changes would be introduced over time, and the Government could place tough new restrictions on EU citizens' rights to bring in family members, it said. The document has been described as ""a platform for discussion"" and has not been agreed by the Government. But it marked the first insight into the Government's thinking on one of the most crucial issues facing Britain as the country negotiates its departure from the EU. Some business leaders expressed concern over the possible impact of an immigration crackdown on the labour market. Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, said: ""Food and drink manufacturing, Britain's largest manufacturing sector, will be alarmed by the proposals."" Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, criticised the plan as not ""just economically illiterate, it's plainly cruel too"", while London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""a blueprint on how to strangle our economy"". But for Brexit supporters, it was ""a great step in the right direction for the UK to take back control of its borders"". ""The Government is right to prioritise highly skilled and skilled migration,"" said MEP Steven Woolfe, a former member of UKIP. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the Government would outline its firm plans later this year. He said free movement of people would end when Britain's membership in the EU ends in March 2019, but insisted ""there is a balance to be struck"". ""We want to attract to this country and not shut the door on highly skilled people who want to come here and make a contribution to society,"" he told Sky News."
2017-09-06,"Immigration, so central to the debate about Britain's place in the EU over the past decades, has been the elephant in the room since the referendum.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170906230818/http://news.sky.com/story/post-brexit-immigration-the-thorniest-issue-of-all-11022896,"As the single market, customs unions and ""control"" of various aspects of policy have been slowly becoming clear, detail on what ministers are actually planning as an alternative to free movement has been scant. Until now. The detailed 82-page paper leaked by The Guardian may only be a draft - peppered with references to the need to consult - but it is the first, tantalising indication of Government thinking, and it is far from business as usual. Theresa May has been clear since she took office that she wants the migration numbers to come down and believes that is what people voted for. Despite the weakness of her leadership, I'm told she has been ""immovable"" on this point in Cabinet discussions. :: Long read: The unpredictable three months ahead The proposals are that low-skilled migrants would get a maximum two years' of residency in Britain and high-skilled, from doctors to bankers and nuclear scientists, up to five years when free movement ends. The priorities are set out as making ""existing residents better off"" and forcing businesses to give jobs to ""resident labour"" from Britain, rather than adding points to our GDP. For big employers, this is the ""cliff edge"" many had feared. And not only big firms, but employers like the NHS, which has 10% of its doctors and 4% of nurses from the EU. The aim of paying higher wages to British workers was not supposed to mean a higher agency fee bill for the cash-strapped health service. The construction, social care, agriculture and hospitality sectors each rely on more than 100,000 migrants to meet their requirements - what the Prime Minister says is a sustainable level for net migration across the board. Who leaked it and to what end? The Home Office is already looking internally at who had access to it, but the draft was also circulated to other relevant departments including the Treasury and Department for Exiting the EU. The leak to the Guardian, a newspaper hostile to the Government's immigration policies, may provide clues. But the leak itself could be played to Mrs May's advantage. There is no estimate in there of the impact of the proposed policies, it is all about ""control"". As one Government insider put it to me: ""Whether it ends up being - 100,000 or 150,000 - the public want to see that the Government have a handle on it and is making the decisions."" Anyway, the net migration figures may not drop by anything like that much. Strict restrictions on income and work already apply to migrants from outside the EU, from which net migration was running at 266,000 in the six months to May; in an area the Government can already control. Is it damaging? Labour's official reaction has been noticeably muted, although pro-European backbenchers have branded the proposals ""mean and cynical"" and there has been anger from London mayor Sadiq Khan, as well as from Nicola Sturgeon. In a statement, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott simply said the party would wait for the Government's official proposals, expected in a white paper in the coming weeks and then published in an immigration bill early next year. While the Labour Party is still divided on its own approach to immigration, it's not very easy to throw stones. Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, has given the PM staunch support this morning. Instead of refusing to comment on the leak, he tacitly endorsed the approach saying people voted for control of migration, and that ministers would need to strike a balance. How these proposals will be received by our negotiating partners in Brussels, how to upskill Britain's population and how this approach fits into the Government's plans to turbo-charge building of homes and infrastructure are yet to be hammered out. And with no Conservative majority in Parliament, the Prime Minister must wait and see how much dissent there is in her party. But the thorniest issue of all - immigration - could not wait forever."

Muslim ... we see.. bet they would still send us down."" His post was taken down shortly afterwards. At Mold Crown Court, Jakovlevs admitted publishing material with the intention of stirring up religious hatred. Prosecutors had argued his message, which could be seen by his 2,154 Facebook friends and other members of the public, had the potential to cause ""serious harm"" and cause ""fear and distress"" to the Muslim community.

2017-09-07,"The Commons has begun debating the EU Withdrawal Bill, with David Davis calling the legislation vital to ensuring an orderly EU divorce and Labour lamenting that it gives unprecedented powers to the Government.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170907234159/http://news.sky.com/story/davis-slams-cynical-labour-attempt-to-block-brexit-bill-11024352,"Mr Davis urged all MPs to back the bill, saying that a Labour attempt to block ""the only viable option"" for Brexit was ""cynical and unprincipled"". ""The British people will not forgive them if the end of their process is to delay or destroy the process by which we leave the European Union,"" he told MPs. His Labour counterpart, Sir Keir Starmer, said the Bill amounted to an ""affront to Parliament"" and a ""betrayal of what we were sent here to do"". Labour has vowed to vote against the Bill on Monday night. During a busy day, Mr Davis was left battling for Brexit on two fronts: at home, where he faced hostile opposition to the Bill; and in Brussels, where chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he was worried by the UK position on the Irish border. The EU (Withdrawal) Bill overturns the 1972 Act that took Britain into what was then the European Economic Community, and converts EU laws into UK statute book. The Government says the legislation is crucial to disentangle the country from the EU. Theresa May said it would ""prevent a cliff-edge for people and businesses, because it provides legal certainty"". Opponents, including some pro-Remain Tory MPs, claim it is a power grab by the Government. Much of the controversy centres on a centuries-old clause which would allow secondary legislation to be passed with little parliamentary scrutiny. Ministers believe between 800 and 1,000 such statutory instruments will be required as Brexit legislation makes its way through Parliament. Mr Davis said the powers were limited, applying only to minor corrections on legislation directly linked to Brexit.Ministers cannot use the power to create serious criminal offences, amend human rights laws or increase taxation, he added. But some of his own party's MPs are uneasy. Senior Tory Ken Clarke hinted he could vote against the Bill and force the Government ""to go back to the drawing board"". The Europhile former chancellor raised concerns over the so-called ""Henry VIII powers"". Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve called the bill ""an astonishing monstrosity"" and said he would vote against it at its third reading unless it is substantially improved. The Brexit Secretary also said he did not believe it made sense to retain the EU's charter of fundamental rights after Brexit - only to be reminded by Sir Keir of a case when Mr Davis had relied on it. It was one of several remarkable exchanges in a day fraught with historical meaning, as the Commons debated the biggest change in the UK's legal system for 45 years. The Brexit Secretary, updating MPs on the status of talks in Brussels, said there was a ""good prospect"" of agreeing a transitional deal with the EU after Britain's membership ends. He has urged EU negotiators to show ""flexibility"" and begin negotiating a future economic relationship that would include a free trade deal. The EU says that cannot happen until substantial progress has been made on divorce terms, including the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and the amount Britain must pay to leave. In Brussels, the EU Commission published five new Brexit papers. New documents showed that Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had questioned Mr Davis' commitment to the talks during a meeting with Mr Barnier in July. Mr Barnier said the UK's proposals for border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic were ""unacceptable"". He also accused the Government of backtracking on its commitment to a financial settlement. Also on Thursday, between 30 and 40 Tory MPs signed a letter spelling out Brexit demands including a transition period in which Britain will be able to sign free trade deals and stop paying money to Brussels. The letter, circulated among members of the Conservative European Research Group (ERG) of Brexit-backing MPs by Change Britain, also states that remaining in the single market during a transition would be a ""historic mistake"". The letter was intended for publication in a Sunday newspaper but was leaked. It will be viewed as an attack on attempts to soften Brexit and on Labour's position of demanding single market membership during a transition period after the UK's official exit from the EU."

During the EU referendum campaign, Ms Davidson was a staunch Remain supporter and famously clashed with Vote Leave figurehead Boris Johnson in a TV debate. In an interview with the New Statesman, the MSP conceded Brexit ""is going to happen"" but warned of the possible effect of the UK's departure from the EU. ""My real fear is that if there's a short-term economic hit, we don't bounce back from it,"" she said. Last week, Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier shared a tense news conference in Brussels following the latest round of talks. Ms Davidson regretted how the UK Government failed to ""pitch-roll"" the start of negotiations. ""I don't think the country was prepared for this period that we're currently in,"" she said. ""People in a room talking and then walking out and up to a bank of microphones and saying entirely different things while standing next to each other is part of what negotiation is."" Ms Davidson has been regularly touted as a future Conservative leader - and perhaps Prime Minister - should she move from Edinburgh down to Westminster. But Ms Davidson spoke of her aim to replace Nicola Sturgeon as Scotland's First Minister in 2021. And - despite her fears over Brexit - she praised current party leader Theresa May as ""absolutely straight down the line"" and ""not a game player"".

HMS Ocean could arrive at its destination in 9-10 days. The UK Government has been accused of failing to help British territories in the region. Critics contrasted Britain's response with that of other European governments with Caribbean territories, including the Dutch, whose military had already been on the ground in St Martin for a number of hours. Josephine Connor, former adviser to the chief minister of Anguilla, said: ""To tell us that you're sending us experts without a timeframe and in the context where everyone knew in advance that this was going to be the largest storm ever recorded in history of the Atlantic is so unacceptable that it's really appalling.

Announcing the support for the British islands, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: ""These are our people, they're British nationals and we're going to do everything possible to get help to them. ""We already have a ship in the area. Mounts Bay is there. She's already at work with her helicopters and her marines helping Anguilla.

Schools, seaports and airports were all affected. He said the island, with a population of 1,800 people, had been ""right in the hurricane's path"" - with no hills to provide cover in the flat country. Mr Browne said about half of its residents had been left homeless, adding the winds were so powerful that 12m (40ft) long containers were lifted into the air - ending up 100m (328ft) away. A two-year-old was killed on the island as a family tried to escape a damaged home during the storm. Mr Browne said that Barbuda may have to be evacuated if another storm, Hurricane Jose, begins to pose a threat. Updating the Commons, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said Anguilla had taken the full force of the storm, causing ""critical"" damage in places. At least one person has died on the island, the Caribbean Disaster Management Agency said, adding that 90% of the island's roads were impassible. Hospitals and power lines have also suffered damage. Sir Alan said there were ""unconfirmed reports of a number of fatalities"". The damage is ""not as severe as first thought"" on another British territory, Monsterrat.

Teachers hope it will make things ""fairer for transgender pupils and eliminate complaints over the decency of short skirts"". The updated uniform, which the school website says ""has been designed specifically in response to the many issues and suggestions raised by parents, students and school staff"", also rectifies the issue of boys having to wear ties while girls do not. It comprises grey trousers, white shirt, navy jumper and a blue and silver tie. Headteacher Tony Smith told the Brighton Argus newspaper: ""Specifically, it addresses the current issues of inequality and decency. ""Another issue was that we have a small but increasing number of transgender students and therefore having the same uniform is important for them."" However, one local mother who was not in favour, told the local newspaper: ""My daughter said she has got a gender and it's female, so being gender neutral when she has got a gender is a big deal for her, as she is proud to be a girl."""
2017-09-07,The six-figure salaries of University vice chancellors will have to be justified under new measures being introduced by the universities minister.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170907234159/http://news.sky.com/story/university-chiefs-pay-over-150000-will-have-to-be-justified-11024661,"Addressing the Universities UK conference, Jo Johnson said he wanted the men and women who run Britain's universities to be ""good stewards of their resources"". The minister told them: ""It is of course true that many of our universities are large and complex organisations, requiring highly skilled individuals to run them effectively. Some will be competing for managerial talent in a global market. ""But it is important to remember that universities are generally still charities with a not-for-profit public service mission and that, when it comes to vice chancellor remuneration, finding the right benchmarks is essential. ""I have heard in recent days one prominent vice chancellor noting she was paid less than footballers or bankers. If university managers want those kinds of wages, they are simply in the wrong business."" The vice chancellor of Reading University Sir David Hill said he welcomed greater transparency. He said: ""The decisions about pay and other aspects of remuneration are not made by vice chancellors, they're made by members of our governing body. And I think it's entirely appropriate for them to think about how they make those decisions."" There has been criticism of the salary levels of vice chancellors. Most earn more than the Prime Minister and have generous pension packages as well as grace-and-favour homes. A recent survey in the Times Higher Education magazine found that the top 10 highest paid vice chancellors received salaries of between £381,000 and £451,000 in 2015-16. Under the new plans, universities will be forced to reveal how many staff earn over £100,000, and will have to justify the salaries of anyone on more than £150,000. There will also be a new regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), which will monitor pay levels. And if universities fail to comply, they could be fined. Mr Johnson said with over 70% of university funding coming from the taxpayer, greater scrutiny was needed. Union representatives said his speech was good news and long overdue. Sally Hunt from the University and College Union said: ""For once, a trade union leader is going to say 'well done' to a Tory politician. ""I think Jo Johnson has done something very important today. He's signalled that where you have public finances and family finances going into fees, you have to have accountability and transparency, particularly from those at the top."""

""But the next step, they think, is an invitation to the cemetery. ""And they will never agree with this."" :: Big threats from Trump benefit Kim Jong Un President Trump has urged China, which is the North's main trading partner and provides much of its oil supply, to put more pressure on Kim to limit his nuclear programme.

Ministers are likely to approve a cash injection so long as they are satisfied there is still a realistic chance of discovering the fate of Madeleine, who was nearly four when she vanished during a family holiday in Portugal in 2007. Detectives from the Metropolitan Police and their Portuguese colleagues have worked together for more than a year to find clues to corroborate their theory. Sky News understands that phase of their investigation is complete and their success will hinge on technical results of their work. The money they are asking for is unlikely to be a large amount, effectively enough to keep a small number of detectives - three or four - on little more than a watching brief. The request should be approved in the next week or so. The Home Office has funded the six-year investigation with £11.2m since it began in 2011. The first year cost £1.9m, but the annual amounts have gradually reduced. In April, detectives were given £85,000 to keep going until the end of this month. On the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance, the Met's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: ""I know we have a significant line of inquiry which is worth pursuing and because it's worth pursuing it could provide an answer. ""But until we've gone through it, I don't know if we are going to get there or not."" Madeleine vanished in May 2007 from a ground-floor holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on the Algarve coast. She had been left sleeping in a room with her younger brother and sister while her parents Kate and Gerry McCann dined nearby with friends. The couple said they made regular checks on their three children and discovered Madeleine was missing around 10pm, insisting she had been abducted. The original Portuguese police investigation was closed after 15 months without establishing any firm clues. It was reopened in 2011. The McCanns, who were considered suspects but then cleared of suspicion, hired a series of private investigators without success. Eventually, they appealed to then prime minister David Cameron, who agreed to ask Scotland Yard to review all the gathered evidence and later start its own inquiry. Early ideas about sex predators, child traffickers and ""a burglary gone wrong"" were largely dismissed before both detective teams joined forces to focus on the latest theory."

It planned to issue proposals later to ""improve benefits for the majority of UK colleagues"". BA said: ""The proposed changes would help protect the pension benefits NAPS members have already earned and improve the company's ability to invest in the customer experience. ""Since 2003, the airline has pumped £3.5bn into NAPS, but the deficit, resulting from record low interest rates and increased life expectancy, had risen to £3.7bn by March this year. ""It is the largest of all UK company pension deficits relative to the company's overall financial value. ""In 2017 alone, the airline will pay £750m in pension contributions and has already committed to provide between £300m and £450m a year till 2027 to address the NAPS deficit. ""If NAPS remained open to future accrual, the cost to the company of providing future benefits to NAPS members could rise to 45% of individual's pensionable pay in 2018 - more than four times the typical employer contribution of UK airlines."" BA made its investment case at a time when it is looking to win back customer trust after a disastrous IT failure over the spring bank holiday weekend that saw 726 flights cancelled and left about 75,000 passengers stranded. It put a cost of £80m on the three-day crisis. However, parent firm IAG later revealed a 37% leap in group half-year operating profits to €975m (£871m) - forecasting they would continue to grow. BA has a chequered history in terms of industrial relations and it currently remains at loggerheads with cabin crew in its mixed fleet who have staged a series of lengthy strikes over pay. The Unite and GMB unions said in response: ""Thousands of loyal and long-serving staff, who have helped build British Airways into a world-class flag carrier for this country and one of the most recognisable global brands, now face uncertainty in their retirement. ""Our team of financial analysts has worked tirelessly with the airline over the last few months to explore ways to keep the pension scheme open and secure it for the future. ""This announcement sadly confirms that our advice has gone unheeded and that we have been unable to convince British Airways that keeping the scheme open is the right thing to do, for both the company and its employees."""

The SWPC said high-frequency radio experienced a wide area of blackouts, loss of contact for up to an hour over the sunlit side of Earth, and low frequency communication, used in navigation, was degraded for an hour. NASA says radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. Two solar flares were released by the Sun this morning, one of which was the most powerful flare recorded since 2008 https://t.co/XpSiMdU159 pic.twitter.com/oYgptLJKyj However, when they are strong enough, they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.

X-class flares are the most intense. The number indicates its strength. An X2 is twice as powerful as an X1, while an X3 is three times as intense."

It means new models developed by JLR will either be pure electric, or hybrids that combine electric and conventional engines. The company next year releases its first fully electric Jaguar - the I-PACE. It has also made an electric concept car of its classic E-type model - but there are no plans so far to put it into production. JLR chief executive Ralf Speth said the move would give customers greater choice. ""We will introduce a portfolio of electrified products across our model range, embracing fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles,"" he said. However, existing models that use pure petrol and diesel engines will still be made - for now at least - as technology evolves. Mr Speth told Sky News: ""Petrol and diesel engines will continue. ""The internal combustion engine is not at an end. We have to do both, we have to refine the internal combustion engine and simultaneously research and develop even more competitive petro-electric vehicles. ""At the end of the day, the banning of petrol and diesel cars announced for 2040 gives a direction. ""But it's also quiet clear that at the moment there are no better engines than the petrol and diesel."" The Government recently confirmed plans to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars in the UK from 2040 - with the aim of getting them off the roads altogether by 2050. JLR, which is owned by Indian conglomerate Tata Motors, employs 40,000 people worldwide and is the UK's biggest car manufacturer. Its three vehicle plants - in Liverpool and the West Midlands - made more than 544,000 cars in 2016. Latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show 71,497 new alternatively fuelled vehicles have been bought in the UK so far this year. This represents a market share of 4.4%, up from 3.2% last year. Sky's Business Presenter Ian King said: ""A lot of people will say that Jaguar Land Rover have come late to the electric vehicle party. ""But JLR is clearly confident that the design of its vehicles will ensure it grabs a significant chunk of this important market. ""Today's announcement also, however, serves as a reminder that Britain, as a country, seriously needs to start preparing for the electric future. ""Generation capacity will need to be increased and charging infrastructure built up. This is going to be a challenge for local, as well as national, government - not to mention the energy industry."""

The 72-year-old entertainer died of a stroke after falling over at her Spanish home just over two years ago. On Thursday night, audiences in her hometown of Liverpool were the first to see Cilla - The Musical. ""Bringing it to life has been great,"" Willis, one of the show's executive producers, explained during a break in rehearsals. ""It's been incredibly healing and a positive way to deal with the various emotions that you have when you're coming to terms with losing your mum and someone that meant a lot to other people as well."" The singer, whose showbusiness career spanned over half a century, had known the musical was in production before she died. Willis said: ""We had to make that decision - do we want to continue with this or not? ""We felt that if we could do something that was like a living memorial to her, that encapsulated what she was about and entertained people, then that was the best way to remember her."" The show has been adapted from the 2014 ITV mini-series which starred Sheridan Smith. It is the story of how Liverpool's best-known daughter found fame working as a cloakroom girl in the Cavern Club at the height of the Merseybeat era. It was John Lennon who introduced Cilla to Beatles producer Brian Epstein who become her manager. The musical explains the rivalry between Epstein and her boyfriend Bobby, the man she eventually married. ""I just want to do her proud - everyone does,"" Willis admited. None more so than actress Kara Lily Hayworth who says she went from ""elated to terrified"" when she found out she beat thousands of others in open auditions to have the chance to play one of Britain's best-loved entertainers. ""I went on a whim, I thought 'well, why not? She was ginger, let's see what happens,' and so it's a quite spectacular thing to get the role. ""I've got some of her mannerisms and a bit of her sound but I tried not to copy her."" Hayworth says she is all too aware of the challenge she faces performing some of Cilla's biggest hits. ""She had a big voice and I don't know if anyone really gave her credit for how incredible her voice was. ""Songs like Anyone Who Had A Heart and You're My World are massive songs but they're great to sing and hopefully the audience will love them as much as I like singing them."" Cilla - The Musical is at Liverpool Empire Theatre until 16 September before it begins a UK-wide tour."

At least nine people have been killed as Irma ripped through the Caribbean. Here is more about Irma's path of destruction so far: :: Antigua and Barbuda  These islands were the first to be hit by Irma. A two-year-old was killed on Barbuda as a family tried to escape a damaged home during the storm. Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne told Sky News the ""carnage in Barbuda is unprecedented"". About half of the island's 1,800 residents have been left homeless, and 90% of its buildings have suffered damage. Although gusts reached speeds of 230mph in Barbuda, the damage in Antigua has been described as ""nominal, to the extent that it is business as usual"". :: St Martin, Anguilla and St Barts  Four people have died on the French side of St Martin, according to French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. The Dutch Royal Navy said ""enormous damage"" had been caused on the Dutch side of the island. Many houses are missing roofs and hotels are underwater, it added. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the storm had been of ""epic proportions"", causing ""widescale destruction of infrastructure, houses and businesses"". ""There is no power, no gasoline, no running water,"" he said. Mr Rutte described how some residents ""are sitting in the dark in ruined houses and are cut off from the outside world"". St Martin and Anguilla experienced heavy rain and winds of up to 185mph. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said ""severe and in places critical"" damage has been seen on Anguilla. He told MPs that the British overseas territory had taken the full force of the hurricane, and there were ""unconfirmed reports of a number of fatalities"". The Caribbean Disaster Management Agency said that 90% of the island's roads were impassible. Anguilla's hospital and airport have also suffered damage, as have power lines. In St Barts, damage has been described as ""apocalyptic"" following winds of 151mph. :: British Virgin Islands Sir Alan Duncan said the islands had suffered ""severe damage"". Sir Richard Branson, whose Necker Island is within the group, said he and friends had ""experienced a night of howling wind and rain as Hurricane Irma edges ever closer"". His son Sam Branson said on social media: ""Glad to say that all humans on Necker are ok although a lot of buildings destroyed."" In a blog post, Sir Richard described the atmosphere as ""eerie but beautiful"". The British entrepreneur and his guests were using a concrete wine cellar as a shelter. ""I suspect there will be little wine left in the cellar when we all emerge,"" he said. :: Puerto Rico Irma was moving over Puerto Rico on Thursday morning. Winds of 100mph left at least 900,000 people without power and nearly 50,000 without water. An economic crisis has led to major funding and staffing cuts at the public power company. That being the case, the power supply may not be restored for up to six months."

Until now. The detailed 82-page paper leaked by The Guardian may only be a draft - peppered with references to the need to consult - but it is the first, tantalising indication of Government thinking, and it is far from business as usual. Theresa May has been clear since she took office that she wants the migration numbers to come down and believes that is what people voted for. Despite the weakness of her leadership, I'm told she has been ""immovable"" on this point in Cabinet discussions. :: Long read: The unpredictable three months ahead The proposals are that low-skilled migrants would get a maximum two years' of residency in Britain and high-skilled, from doctors to bankers and nuclear scientists, up to five years when free movement ends. The priorities are set out as making ""existing residents better off"" and forcing businesses to give jobs to ""resident labour"" from Britain, rather than adding points to our GDP. For big employers, this is the ""cliff edge"" many had feared. And not only big firms, but employers like the NHS, which has 10% of its doctors and 4% of nurses from the EU. The aim of paying higher wages to British workers was not supposed to mean a higher agency fee bill for the cash-strapped health service. The construction, social care, agriculture and hospitality sectors each rely on more than 100,000 migrants to meet their requirements - what the Prime Minister says is a sustainable level for net migration across the board. Who leaked it and to what end? The Home Office is already looking internally at who had access to it, but the draft was also circulated to other relevant departments including the Treasury and Department for Exiting the EU. The leak to the Guardian, a newspaper hostile to the Government's immigration policies, may provide clues. But the leak itself could be played to Mrs May's advantage. There is no estimate in there of the impact of the proposed policies, it is all about ""control"". As one Government insider put it to me: ""Whether it ends up being - 100,000 or 150,000 - the public want to see that the Government have a handle on it and is making the decisions."" Anyway, the net migration figures may not drop by anything like that much. Strict restrictions on income and work already apply to migrants from outside the EU, from which net migration was running at 266,000 in the six months to May; in an area the Government can already control. Is it damaging? Labour's official reaction has been noticeably muted, although pro-European backbenchers have branded the proposals ""mean and cynical"" and there has been anger from London mayor Sadiq Khan, as well as from Nicola Sturgeon. In a statement, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott simply said the party would wait for the Government's official proposals, expected in a white paper in the coming weeks and then published in an immigration bill early next year. While the Labour Party is still divided on its own approach to immigration, it's not very easy to throw stones. Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, has given the PM staunch support this morning. Instead of refusing to comment on the leak, he tacitly endorsed the approach saying people voted for control of migration, and that ministers would need to strike a balance. How these proposals will be received by our negotiating partners in Brussels, how to upskill Britain's population and how this approach fits into the Government's plans to turbo-charge building of homes and infrastructure are yet to be hammered out. And with no Conservative majority in Parliament, the Prime Minister must wait and see how much dissent there is in her party. But the thorniest issue of all - immigration - could not wait forever."

It comes after the report was leaked to the BBC last month and revealed 92% of ""viable"" firms seen by GRG experienced ""inappropriate action"", such as interest charges being raised or unnecessary fees imposed. Only one in 10 made it back to the main bank, it reported. Ms Morgan warned the leak has left the FCA with ""no control over the timing or content"" of further public disclosures from the so-called skilled persons' report. GRG was meant to help struggling business customers but it has faced allegations - denied by the bank - that it forced them into positions of financial distress in order to benefit its own position. The FCA said in November 2016 that a ""full account"" on its review of the former unit between 2008 and 2013 would be published, but has so far not made it public. Ms Morgan said: ""Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. ""The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it."" She added: ""The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay."" The FCA said it would ""respond in due course"" to Ms Morgan's letter. It added it had launched an internal inquiry into the leak and had ""asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same"".

The industry most commonly presented the relationship between alcohol and cancer as highly complex, implying there was no evidence of a consistent or independent link, according to the study. Other tactics included denying that any relationship existed or claiming that there was no risk for light or moderate drinking, as well as presenting alcohol as just one risk among many. Alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for a range of cancers, including oral cavity, liver, breast and colorectal cancers, and accounts for about 4% of new cancer cases annually in the UK. The latest British government advice on alcohol, issued last year, makes an explicit link between cancer and alcohol. It states: ""The risk of developing a range of health problems (including cancers of the mouth, throat and breast) increases the more you drink on a regular basis."" During the consultation phase the alcohol industry challenged the link with cancer. The authors of the report, published in the Drug and Alcohol Review journal, said it was important to highlight that those who drink within the recommended guidelines - not more than 14 units a week for both men and women - ""shouldn't be too concerned when it comes to cancer"". Mark Petticrew, Professor of Public Health at the LSHTM and the study's lead author, told Sky News: ""The information, on balance, across organisations we looked at seems to be quite extensively inaccurate or misrepresents the evidence. ""The evidence linking alcohol consumption and cancer is reasonably clear and has firmed up over recent years. The information on these websites, given out by alcohol bodies, appears to be not representing that evidence base, which is quite consistent. ""We know the tobacco industry attempted to confuse the relationship between lung cancer and smoking and put out a lot of very distracting information. We see similar types of argument use in these alcohol industry websites."" Institute of Alcohol Studies chief executive Katherine Brown said: ""This report shows that, like the tobacco industry before them, alcohol companies are misleading consumers about the evidence linking their products to cancer. ""We cannot rely on a profit-driven industry to promote public health. Consumers have a right to know the truth about alcohol and cancer, so they can make fully informed decisions about their drinking."" The alcohol industry denied the report's findings. Drinkaware, a charitable trust funded by drinks manufacturers, said: ""Its recent review of Drinkaware's cancer information, which is extensive, has confirmed that the information we are providing accurately reflects the most recent research evidence."" Henry Ashworth, president of the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, said: ""We do not agree with the conclusions reached in this paper. We believe in sharing the current state of the scientific evidence and stand by the information that we publish on drinking and health."" Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ""This is a diatribe disguised as a study that seeks to create a false narrative in which businesses always lie and anti-alcohol campaigners always tell the truth. ""We need to have sensible and evidence-based information about the risks of alcohol. The risks associated with cancer are not the biggest risks when it comes to drinking, the bigger risks are to do with violence, drink-driving and liver cirrhosis. ""It's not cancer, so I'm not convinced that actually people understood fully what the risks associated with drinking are in terms of cancer when it doesn't have an effect on people's consumption of it at all."""
2017-09-07,"A former pole dancer dubbed the ""black widow"" is launching a rare legal case by asking a High Court judge to rule that she did not murder her millionaire husband.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170907234159/http://news.sky.com/story/black-widow-anna-ziuzina-asks-judge-to-rule-she-did-not-kill-millionaire-husband-11024627,"Ukrainian Anna Ziuzina, 38, says she is planning the action because his family are driving a political campaign, involving Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, to have her arrested and charged. She hopes it will help her inherit a share of his £2m fortune after a long courtroom battle with his family. They say she should inherit nothing because, as they told a coroner in January, they believe she murdered her husband Barry Pring. Mr Pring, a British IT consultant, died on their wedding anniversary when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver on the hard shoulder of a motorway outside Kiev. His widow said they had enjoyed a boozy celebration meal and had crossed the safety barrier to hitch a ride back into the city. She had just turned back towards the restaurant to retrieve her gloves - and, according to a witness, made a telephone call - when a car hit her husband. Earlier this year, a Devon coroner ruled that Mr Pring, 47, was killed unlawfully after being ""tricked"" into going on to the motorway, effectively pointing the finger of blame at Ms Ziuzina. She later got the coroner's conclusion quashed, arguing she was not given enough notice to attend and questioning the motives of a key witness. Ms Ziuzina is hoping to get the High Court murder ruling delivered before a new inquest is heard. Legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg said: ""It's always been the law that you can't benefit from deliberately killing someone. You can't benefit from murder or manslaughter. ""So, what she wants is for the civil court in London to decide whether she actually had a part in murdering her husband. Obviously, it's a high-risk strategy. If the court says she had a part in his murder then she doesn't benefit in any way. If they say she doesn't, she clears her name and gets to inherit."" Ms Ziuzina has never been arrested or charged. A Ukrainian police murder investigation has stalled and British police have no jurisdiction in the case. But her lawyer says in a statement to the High Court that she wants the rare ruling on her innocence because she feels there is a new, politically driven and ""dangerous threat"" to her liberty. Her lawyer, John Cabot, says Mr Pring's brother Shaughan has orchestrated a political and media campaign against her involving his local MP and the Foreign Secretary. In his court statement, Mr Cabot says: ""(She) had reasonable grounds to believe she was in peril of the Foreign Secretary having placed political pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to arrest and prosecute her for the murder of the deceased."" He says: ""It has been a long-standing concern of (hers) that action would be taken against her by the Ukrainian authorities not because of the strength of any evidence against her, but as a matter of political expediency, because of the desire at political level in the Ukraine to maintain goodwill with the British authorities."" Ms Ziuzina now lives in Marbella with her partner Ivan Lister, a wealthy British businessman, their four-year old daughter and a new baby born in February. She said nothing and slammed her garden door shut when we approached her this week. Mr Lister said he was aware of the court action, but refused to discuss it. When I congratulated him on his new baby, he replied: ""How do you know it is ours? I may have borrowed it."" In the past, Barry Pring's family have described Ms Ziuzina as a ""gold digger"" and questioned why she did not attend her husband's funeral or inquest. Mr Pring died without making a will and his estate is frozen pending the conclusion of the police investigation and inquest. His brother Shaughan and mother Irene said in a joint statement: ""We're approaching the 10th anniversary of Barry's murder. ""We've had to fight our own corner for all these years, and at our own expense. ""During this period, our much loved husband and father has died in distress and confusion as to Barry's death. ""We feel desperately let down by Devon and Cornwall Police, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British justice system. ""All we've ever wanted is justice for Barry."""

The report from Stonewall found that 21% of LGBT people faced hate crime about their sexual orientation and/or gender in the last year. Four in 10 transgender people experienced hate crime in relation to their gender in the last year. However, 81% of those people didn't report such incidents to police. Reg Kheraj, 28, was attacked after a night out in London's Soho with friends. He said: ""I was pinned up against the wall and choked on my throat by two guys. ""One of them put his hand up to me like he was going to punch me in the face. ""The other one smashed a burger up against my face and rubbed it all down my clothes, all down the front of me; all the while throwing pretty horrific homophobic and abusive insults at me."" Mr Kheraj says he was traumatised by the attack, which is the third time he's been targeted in the last year. Charity Stonewall say while laws and attitudes have changed in recent decades, there's a long way to go. Dominic Arnall, head of projects and programmes, said: ""We've got a lot further to go as this research demonstrates. ""I think whereas for some LGBT people there's been tremendous progression - we've seen in 2014 equal marriage we've seen some wonderful strides forward, unfortunately there's still an awfully long way to go."" The charity want more people from LGBT communities to report discrimination and hate crimes to police. They have launched a new campaign to make the stand against LGBT hate crime."
2017-09-07,Ryanair's non-priority passengers will only be able to take one piece of hand luggage into the cabin instead of two from 1 November.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170907234159/http://news.sky.com/story/ryanair-cuts-carry-on-luggage-allowance-to-stem-delays-11022921,"Only priority-boarding customers, who pay €5/£5 each way for the privilege, will be allowed two bags - one normal size (55cm x 40cm x 20cm) and one smaller bag (35cm x 20cm x 20cm). Everyone else will only be able to carry the smaller size bag, such as a handbag or laptop bag. Wheelie-style cases, that all customers could previously put in overhead lockers, will now be placed free in the hold at the boarding gate. Ryanair said it had taken the decision because flights were being delayed because of a shortage of locker space. Well done! Good decision! As a passenger who takes a backpack as hand luggage, I'm sick of people who take large bags and use all the space Great idea. I always put my hand luggage in the hold just before I get on. Much easier than fighting for a space in the cabin. Also from 1 November, the weight allowance for checked-in bags will increase from 15kg to 20kg, but the price drops from £35 to £25. Customers with infants will still be able to take an additional changing bag (5kg) on board with them. Passengers with waivers for medical items will also be able to board with them if they contact the airline's special assistance line in advance. Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said he hoped the changes would ""speed up the boarding of flights and eliminate flight delays"". He said: ""We believe offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage more customers to consider checking-in a bag, which will reduce the high volume of customers we have with two carry-on bags at the boarding gates - which is causing flight delays due to large numbers of gate bag and cabin bag offloads."" Good for long flights. Not good for flights under 1 hour long. Wait for bags may be longer than flight. As a frequent flyer, not happy. What a shame! I loved being able to bring my small wheelie and my handbag to not be held up on arrival waiting for my bag to arrive :( There was a mixed reaction to the reduced baggage allowance for non-priority boarders with some travellers on social media slamming the move, while others hailed it a step in the right direction. One angry Twitter user wrote: ""Good for long flights. Not good for flights under 1 hour long. Wait for bags may be longer than flight. As a frequent flyer, not happy."" Another said: ""What a shame! I loved being able to bring my small wheelie and my handbag to not be held up on arrival waiting for my bag to arrive :(."" However, some welcomed the action, tweeting: ""Well done! Good decision! As a passenger who takes a backpack as hand luggage, I'm sick of people who take large bags and use all the space."" Another passenger wrote: ""Great idea. I always put my hand luggage in the hold just before I get on. Much easier than fighting for a space in the cabin."" Hi Darren, It can be added after booking (for €/£6) up to 1 hour before the scheduled flight departure time, via the Ryanair app. So I cant add priority for the discounted rate? So now you want to charge me more for an option I would have taken if known about changes?? The new baggage policy applies to all bookings made before and after 1 November. ""If i'd known about change when I booked I would have added priority boarding as I like both bags with me, undamaged,"" wrote one angry passenger in a Twitter exchange with the airline's social media team. When he learned he would have to pay the higher rate of €6/£6 - not the discounted booking rate - if he now wanted to upgrade to a priority seat, he added: ""We are being penalised by your policy change yet you state customers are getting a BETTER deal."""

In a new diplomatic move, the White House wants the UN Security Council to slap an oil embargo on the secretive state as well as hitting dictator Kim Jong Un with a travel ban and freezing his assets. The US, which has accused Kim of ""begging for war"", also believes there should be a ban on the country exporting textiles and the hiring of North Korean workers abroad. The proposed measures are contained in a draft resolution which the US wants the 15-member council to vote on this Monday. But Russia said that could be ""a little premature"" and its leader Vladimir Putin has said solving the crisis was impossible with sanctions alone. Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang escalated after the rogue nation claimed last Sunday it had detonated a hydrogen bomb - its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date. It said its test was a ""perfect success"" and the bomb was designed to be mounted on its newly-developed intercontinental ballistic missile. Mr Trump has urged China, which is the North's main trading partner and provides much of its oil supply, to put more pressure on Kim to limit his controversial nuclear programme. The US leader told reporters he has had a ""strong"" and ""frank"" phone conversation with China's President Xi Jinping about North Korea and said neither of them would put up with the rogue nation's provocative actions. The White House said both leaders were committed to taking ""further action"" aimed at ""denuclearising"" the Korean peninsula. Mr Trump did not rule out military strikes against Kim's secretive state, but indicated other options for pressure would come first, adding ""we'll see what happens"". He said: ""President Xi would like to do something. We'll see whether or not he can do it. But we will not be putting up with what's happening in North Korea."" He added: ""I believe that President Xi agrees with me 100%. We had a very, very frank and very strong phone call."" President Xi told his US counterpart that Beijing remains committed to stopping the North's nuclear ambitions and maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. :: Sanctions on North Korea are 'useless' - Putin For a UN Security Council resolution to be adopted, it needs nine members to back it and no vetoes by the US, Britain, France, Russia or China. Sky's Washington Correspondent Mark Austin said: ""China fears tough sanctions could bring down the Kim regime and that would lead to chaos on its border. ""It's going to be very hard for Donald Trump to get China on side. There is no sign yet that they will back really tough sanctions."" Washington has rejected China's proposal for a freeze on the North's nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a suspension of US-South Korea military drills. :: Mark Austin: Big threats from Trump benefit Kim Jong Un A report in South Korea on Tuesday claimed Kim's regime was seen moving what appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile towards its west coast. Analysts say it is most likely the secretive state will carry out its next ""provocative"" act on or around 9 September when the country celebrates its founding day."

The production of motor vehicles, trailers and semi trailers grew at the fastest rate since March 2009 at 13.7%. However, separate ONS data showed the construction industry is continuing to struggle with output falling - for the fourth consecutive month - by 0.9% in July because of a lack of new projects. There was also little improvement in the trade deficit - the gap between exports and imports - which remained static at £2.9bn. Exports of goods to the EU increased but this was offset by falling goods exports to the rest of the world. Growth in the broader measure of industrial output slowed to 0.2% from 0.5%, due to an easing back in oil and gas extraction after a spike in June. The official manufacturing figures reflect some of the buoyancy of recent surveys, which up until now have suggested the weaker pound since the Brexit vote is proving more of a double-edged sword than hoped for 'made in Britain' - highlighting an impact from higher import costs in the production process. Earlier this week, UK factories questioned by business advisory firm BDO and EEF, the manufacturers' body, reported bumper order books, suggesting it has taken time for exporters to feel the benefits of sterling's collapse which has also made UK goods more competitive abroad. However, this robust manufacturing performance is being countered by slower growth in services - which represents more than three-quarters of output - and construction. Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist, said: ""While the data suggests the weakened exchange rate may be helping the economy in terms of rebalancing towards exports and goods production, the rate of improvement remains modest. ""Slowdowns in services and construction are a concern and highlight subdued domestic demand and investment trends."" Howard Archer, chief economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said the ONS data ""points to a UK economy still struggling to break out of sluggish growth"". But Ruth Gregory, of Capital Economics, said: ""Looking ahead, the surveys suggest that both manufacturing and export growth should pick up further, while the consumer slowdown should weigh on import volumes. As a result, we remain optimistic that growth should hold up fairly well in the second half of the year, rather than slow."""
2017-09-08,"Labour has said a Government plan to award itself majorities on key legislative committees amounts to an attempt to ""rig Parliament"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170908235220/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-accuses-govt-of-trying-to-rig-parliament-with-committee-changes-11025027,"It comes amid ongoing controversy over powers contained in the EU Withdrawal Bill, which opposition parties have described as a ""power grab"". The latest proposals, tabled by Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom, look set to further fuel accusations the Government is undermining the democratic process as it battles to deliver Brexit. The motion put forward proposes changing parliamentary rules so that ""where a committee has an odd number of members, the Government shall have a majority"". This has major significance when it comes to the little-known but powerful Committee of Selection, which decides which MPs sit on the standing committees that scrutinise legislative bills. Conventionally, the party political representation on the Committee of Selection reflects the results of the last election. Given Theresa May failed to win an overall majority at the 8 June election, the anticipated make-up of this nine-member committee would be four Conservative MPs, four Labour MPs and one Scottish National Party MP. However, the motion put forward by Ms Leadsom would ensure five MPs on the Committee of Selection would be Conservatives. The PM's spokesman said: ""The Government has a majority on the floor on the House, therefore, it is perfectly legitimate ...that we should have a majority on the committee."" The spokesman added: ""The Government has a programme of business it wants to get through in a timely manner and MPs get to vote on it on Tuesday. ""We believe these are common sense proposals."" In a tweet, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the move was ""an unprecedented attempt to rig parliament and grab power by a Conservative government with no majority and no mandate"". When challenged by reporters on why a minority government should have the right to a majority on the committees, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister said the government had a ""majority on the floor of the House"". MPs will vote on the committee proposals next Tuesday evening, while on Monday they will be asked to vote on the second reading of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. The Government has faced criticism from the opposition and some within the Conservative party over clauses in that Bill which would give Ministers sweeping powers to amend regulations as they are transposed from EU law into domestic law. The Brexit Secretary says such powers are a practical necessity to ensure there is a functioning statute book once the UK leaves the EU, but critics argue it would mean changes would not receive sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. Labour's shadow Commons Leader Valerie Vaz told The Independent the combination of the proposals to change the make-up of committees and the repeal bill should worry voters. ""On Monday the Government are seeking the power to change the law by ministerial edict and on Tuesday they will try to sideline opposition in Parliament by rigging the committee system so that they are guaranteed a majority they didn't secure at the ballot box. Mark Tami, a Labour MP and a member of the Committee for Selection said: ""Andrea Leadsom seems to be suggesting this is a minor issue, but it's not minor at all - if you fix the Committee for Selection, you effectively fix the rest"". ""I would hope some Conservative constitutionalists might think this is a step too far, but they've been pretty quiet recently""."

Despite the weakness of her leadership, I'm told she has been ""immovable"" on this point in Cabinet discussions. :: Long read: The unpredictable three months ahead The proposals are that low-skilled migrants would get a maximum two years' of residency in Britain and high-skilled, from doctors to bankers and nuclear scientists, up to five years when free movement ends. The priorities are set out as making ""existing residents better off"" and forcing businesses to give jobs to ""resident labour"" from Britain, rather than adding points to our GDP. For big employers, this is the ""cliff edge"" many had feared. And not only big firms, but employers like the NHS, which has 10% of its doctors and 4% of nurses from the EU. The aim of paying higher wages to British workers was not supposed to mean a higher agency fee bill for the cash-strapped health service. The construction, social care, agriculture and hospitality sectors each rely on more than 100,000 migrants to meet their requirements - what the Prime Minister says is a sustainable level for net migration across the board. Who leaked it and to what end? The Home Office is already looking internally at who had access to it, but the draft was also circulated to other relevant departments including the Treasury and Department for Exiting the EU. The leak to the Guardian, a newspaper hostile to the Government's immigration policies, may provide clues. But the leak itself could be played to Mrs May's advantage. There is no estimate in there of the impact of the proposed policies, it is all about ""control"". As one Government insider put it to me: ""Whether it ends up being - 100,000 or 150,000 - the public want to see that the Government have a handle on it and is making the decisions."" Anyway, the net migration figures may not drop by anything like that much. Strict restrictions on income and work already apply to migrants from outside the EU, from which net migration was running at 266,000 in the six months to May; in an area the Government can already control. Is it damaging? Labour's official reaction has been noticeably muted, although pro-European backbenchers have branded the proposals ""mean and cynical"" and there has been anger from London mayor Sadiq Khan, as well as from Nicola Sturgeon. In a statement, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott simply said the party would wait for the Government's official proposals, expected in a white paper in the coming weeks and then published in an immigration bill early next year. While the Labour Party is still divided on its own approach to immigration, it's not very easy to throw stones. Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, has given the PM staunch support this morning. Instead of refusing to comment on the leak, he tacitly endorsed the approach saying people voted for control of migration, and that ministers would need to strike a balance. How these proposals will be received by our negotiating partners in Brussels, how to upskill Britain's population and how this approach fits into the Government's plans to turbo-charge building of homes and infrastructure are yet to be hammered out. And with no Conservative majority in Parliament, the Prime Minister must wait and see how much dissent there is in her party. But the thorniest issue of all - immigration - could not wait forever."
2017-09-08,"A police chief who took the controversial decision to use a child rapist as an informant against a grooming gang says he has received ""hundreds and hundreds"" of supportive messages from the public.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170908235220/http://news.sky.com/story/police-chief-defends-using-child-rapist-as-informant-in-newcastle-grooming-case-11026080,"Northumbria Police's decision to pay the unnamed convict almost £10,000 had made headlines when the details emerged last month. But after all but one member of the grooming gang was sentenced for their roles in recruiting vulnerable young women, giving them drugs and then persuading or forcing them into sex, Chief Constable Steve Ashman described the ""outpouring of public support"" for his force's decisions. Mr Ashman said: ""When reflecting upon the morality of the decision, I think it's important to take account of public opinion. ""If the moral compass was spinning when it was first made public a few weeks ago, when the verdicts were handed out, it's absolutely fixed now in our favour. ""If I had any doubt, and I didn't personally, but if I had any doubt whether it was the right thing to do, then I'm absolutely determined now that it was."" Mr Ashman said the child rapist - known only as XY - was not tasked with going to parties, but said some of his information was ""absolutely pivotal in putting some very, very dangerous people behind bars"". The chief constable's remarks came as a woman who had found vulnerable victims for the grooming gang was jailed for six years and three months. Carolann Gallon had taken a 13-year-old who had run away from foster care to a Tyneside flat - knowing she was likely to be the victim of a sexual offence. Now 22, Gallon admitted to three counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation at Newcastle Crown Court. The shaven-headed defendant was obstructive with police when they made inquiries in 2012. The following year, Gallon took the same girl from a children's home and brought her to a series of addresses. The girl was given drink and drugs at flats where men flirted with her and put their arms around her. She told detectives that ""sexual stuff"" happened there, and that ""a man had sex with her against her will"", the court heard. The court was also told Gallon had invited a 14-year-old staying at another care home in the North East to a ""binge"", but police stopped her. Gallon rearranged the meeting - and the girl was taken to a house where she was given vodka and cannabis. The grooming gang had tricked girls into thinking they were in a relationship, gave them drink and drugs at parties, then forced them into having sex with other men. John Elvidge QC, prosecuting, said Gallon told police after she was arrested: ""They shouldn't have too much to drink. ""If they want to go with them, they have got their own mind to go with people. It's self-inflicted, I've got no sympathy."" The court heard Gallon also took a girl with learning difficulties to a flat where she was raped by Abdulhamid Minoyee. Minoyee, 34, had given the girl cannabis and raped her while she was intoxicated. He has been jailed for 15 years. One remaining member of the gang will be sentenced next week. In total, 17 men and one woman have been convicted."

The court heard claims the 56-year-old threatened to cut the cockerel's head off and shouted homophobic abuse at Helen Richardson and Paula Holland, who lived next to him in Marchwood, Hampshire. He was also accused of playing loud music, including the Percy Sledge song When A Man Loves A Woman. Mr Dymott, who denied both charges of harassment, said he only played loud music on two occasions to drown out the noise of the birds and said he did not swear at his neighbours or insult their sexuality. However, he did admit calling Ms Richardson ""a psycho"". The defendant told the trial he had complained to police himself about the noise created by his neighbours' cockerel and hens and blamed the volume on the type of chicken. Mr Dymott said: ""Those cockerels go off as much as 60 to 70 times an hour. This is not a British bird, these are birds going all the time. ""When they started crowing they do not just crow once, they crow, crow, crow."" He added: ""It's the type of chickens - these aren't ordinary little reds, these are colourful, these are Rhode Island reds, these are Plymouth Rocks, these are American reds. ""If these had been a British cockerel and going off at dawn and dusk we wouldn't be here."" The court has heard Ms Richardson and Ms Holland had arranged for the cockerel to be killed in August 2015 but the dispute continued after Mr Dymott alleged they were hiding a cockerel from him. The trial also heard Mr Dymott and Ms Richardson clashed in her front garden which she said caused her an injury to her arm while the defendant said he suffered a cut lip. The restraining order imposed by magistrates prohibits Mr Dymott from contacting the two women directly or indirectly for two years. Chairman of the bench Colin Wyatt said: ""Whilst we find some of the actions and behaviour were inappropriate we do not feel this constitutes the offence of harassment."" On the playing of music, he said: ""We agree the course of action was childish, immature and petulant."" Mr Wyatt added: ""You have to live as neighbours, you need to behave and stop being stupid or petulant. ""Can you get on as neighbours, life is too short."""

Reader walked away from the safe deposit vault after the gang failed to break into it at their first attempt. During a second night of drilling the others escaped with jewellery, gold and cash in Britain's biggest ever commercial burglary. His barrister James Scobie told a judge that conversations between other gang members were bugged by police and showed Reader was not in Hatton Garden when the loot was stolen. He said: ""The probe material will endorse the fact that he did not carry through the agreed joint enterprise. ""He was effectively written off as a benefactor by those who did carry did carry it through."" Reader, the oldest of the so-called Dad's Army gang, is seriously ill with cancer and has suffered a stroke. He appeared in the dock in a wheelchair alongside two guards and struggled to hear what was said. Last year he was jailed for six years and three months after admitting conspiracy to burgle. During the trial of other gang members the police bugs recorded two of them criticising Reader for pulling out after the first night and suggesting he deserved nothing. Mr Scobie said the others discussed ""Kenny"" - perhaps gang member John 'Kenny' Collins - giving Reader a parcel, but there was no evidence he ever received one. Details emerged during a preliminary Proceeds of Crime Act hearing, in which the prosecution is trying to get back the missing loot from the 2015 raid. So far, only a fraction has been recovered, just over £4m worth. A full hearing against all those convicted will begin in January and is expected to last six weeks, as long as the original trial. Prosecutor Philip Evans told the judge there were 50 potential witnesses and he was waiting for defence lawyers to decide which of them they needed to appear to be cross-examined at the January hearing. He also said that most of the recovered stolen items had not been returned to the losers because defence had not valued them. ""Businesses are being affected dramatically,"" he said. Collins' lawyer Lisa Freeman said: ""We are all very conscious of returning items."""

Muslim ... we see.. bet they would still send us down."" His post was taken down shortly afterwards. At Mold Crown Court, Jakovlevs admitted publishing material with the intention of stirring up religious hatred. Prosecutors had argued his message, which could be seen by his 2,154 Facebook friends and other members of the public, had the potential to cause ""serious harm"" and cause ""fear and distress"" to the Muslim community. Sue Hemming, head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division of the CPS, said: ""After the Manchester attack there were countless messages of support on social media for those affected but Keegan Jakovlevs chose to stir up religious hatred by calling for British Muslims to be indiscriminately killed. ""No harmful consequences appear to have resulted but his intention was clear and he pleaded guilty once he saw the CPS's case against him. ""People should not assume they can hide on social media when stirring up hatred and violence. Where there is evidence, the CPS will prosecute them and they will face imprisonment as a result."""

She died four days later. The teenager donated her heart, small bowel, pancreas, kidneys, lungs, and liver to eight recipients, including five children, across the UK. Her parents said Jemima would have been ""very proud of her legacy"". Her mother, Sophy Layzell, said: ""We knew Jemima was willing to be a donor following a conversation about it a couple of weeks before her unexpected death. ""The conversation was prompted by the death of someone we knew in a crash. ""They were on the register but their organs couldn't be donated because of the circumstances of their death. ""Jemima had never heard of organ donation before and found it a little bit unsettling but totally understood the importance of it. ""We found the decision to donate Jemima's organs hard but we both felt it was right and we knew she was in favour of donation."" She added: ""We had no idea Jemima was the only person whose organs were transplanted into eight different people until NHS Blood and Transplant told us. ""Everyone wants their child to be special and unique and this among other things makes us very proud."" According to NHS Blood and Transplant, 457 people died waiting for a transplant last year, including 14 children. There are currently 6,414 people on the transplant waiting list, including 176 children. Anthony Clarkson, NHS Blood and Transplant's assistant director of organ donation and transplantation, said: ""Every donor is special and Jemima's unique story shows the extraordinary difference a few words can make. ""Hundreds of people are still dying unnecessarily waiting for a transplant because too many families say no to organ donation. ""Please tell your family you want to donate, and if you are unsure, ask yourself: if you needed a transplant would you accept one? If so, shouldn't you be prepared to donate?"""

Warwick Crown Court was told a call handler ""averted disaster"" by talking the teenager into taking the gun apart during June's incident. The youth, who cannot be named, admitted taking the weapon with him in order to harm people. He was also carrying 200 cartridges and a lock-knife. He had taken the double-barrelled shotgun from a secure cabinet where it was legally stored by one of his relatives. Judge Andrew Lockhart QC told him: ""You had a face covering and a knife and you were making yourself ready to shoot at anyone. All who might have been a target would have been wholly innocent victims without any argument with you. ""Had you begun to shoot I have no doubt serious injury and death would have resulted and it is impossible for me to predict how many might have been hit.

He told the court the boy was receiving mental health support to aid his rehabilitation. The boy will serve up to half of his sentence in custody before being released on licence for remainder of the term."

""Further to the announcement made on 10 January 2017, the board of Trinity Mirror notes that it is now in discussions to acquire 100% of the publishing assets of Northern & Shell and that it has ceased discussions to acquire a minority stake,"" the group said on Friday. It added: ""Any acquistion would require the approval of Trinity Mirror shareholders."" It is unclear how much the deal could be worth, although Mr Desmond acquired the titles in 2000 for £125m. It means an earlier mooted takeover involving former News of the World editor David Montgomery, which Sky News revealed in May, is likely to have fallen through. Mr Montgomery had been planning to create a new venture with private equity firms that would house the Northern & Shell titles, in which Trinity would have been a minority stakeholder."
2017-09-08,"""Deferred"" prosecutions could be offered to criminals under reforms put forward as part of a landmark inquiry.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170908235220/http://news.sky.com/story/justice-review-calls-for-deferred-prosecution-to-tackle-discrimination-11024812,"The proposal is one of 35 recommendations from the Lammy review into how Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people are treated within the justice system. Before entering a plea offenders would be given the opportunity to complete a rehabilitation programme such as drug or alcohol treatment. Successful completion would see the charges dropped while those who failed would go on to face criminal proceedings. The idea was trialled through a pilot called Operation Turning Point, in the West Midlands, between 2011 and 2014. Labour MP David Lammy, who led the inquiry, said that the review also highlighted evidence of ""bias"" and ""overt discrimination"" within parts of the justice system. Figures show that BAME men and women make up just 14% of the general population of England and Wales, while behind bars they account for 25% of prisoners. If the numbers were proportionate to the population there would be 9,000 fewer inmates, the equivalent of 12 average size prisons. In one area of offending, drugs, it was revealed that BAME people were 240% more likely to be sent to prison than white offenders. David Lammy, MP, told Sky News: ""That is worrying and obviously something I hope the judiciary will look at intently. ""That accounted for the plea people make, for previous convictions, for gender and for age. ""So it was a detailed piece of work that has never been done before and I think it is incumbent now on the judiciary to explain what they think is going on and to look in a more detailed way, systematically, at issues of ethnicity and sentencing."" Other recommendations include: :: Redacting identifying information from case files passed from police to the Crown Prosecution Service so that charging decisions are ""race blind"". :: All sentencing remarks in the Crown Court should be published in audio and/or written form to improve transparency. :: There should be a national target for greater diversity with more BAME representation in the judiciary and magistracy by 2025. :: Youth offender panels should take place in the community with an emphasis on parenting responsibilities and accountability. :: A US-style system for ""sealing"" criminal records so that ex-offenders who can prove they have reformed do not have to disclose past convictions to prospective employers. The study also found that BAME young offenders in custody rose from 25% to 41% between 2006 and 2016 despite the overall number of young offenders falling to record lows. Bobby Kasanga spent nearly eight years in prison for robbery offences and now works with young people in the Hackney community. He agrees with the idea of ""sealing"" criminal records and ""deferring"" prosecution. ""One reason I started the football club and being entrepreneurial was because I had a criminal record no one wanted to hire me,"" he said. ""So why allow these young men to get records in the first place if there is a chance rehabilitate themselves? ""Sometimes it's just a mistake that you make when you're young that can change your whole life so why not defer that decision to prosecute."" The review also cited data showing ""stark differences"" in plea decisions between different ethnic groups. Between 2006 and 2014 BAME defendants pleaded not guilty to 40% of charges compared to 31% for white defendants. The inquiry suggested that a lack of trust was one major reason for the difference. Mr Lammy said many BAME defendants ""simply do not believe that the justice system will deliver less punitive treatment if they plead guilty"". Robert Brown, lawyer for Corker Binnings, said that ""confidence in the system was low, very low and maybe at an all time low"". ""What I am seeing now is that what was wrong with the criminal justice system at the time of the Stephen Lawrence case is wrong with the system now,"" he said. The Lammy review also estimated that the economic cost of over-representation of BAME people within the justice system was around £309m a year."
2017-09-08,"The alcohol industry is misleading the public by downplaying the risk of cancer through similar tactics to the tobacco industry, researchers say. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170908235220/http://news.sky.com/story/alcohol-industry-playing-down-risk-of-cancer-by-using-tobacco-industry-tactics-11024727,"A study led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and Sweden's Karolinska Institutet found the industry is using ""denying, distortion and distraction"" strategies to minimise evidence. Researchers analysed information relating to cancer on the websites and documents of 28 alcohol industry organisations between September and December last year, finding that most showed ""some sort of distortion or misrepresentation"" of evidence. The industry most commonly presented the relationship between alcohol and cancer as highly complex, implying there was no evidence of a consistent or independent link, according to the study. Other tactics included denying that any relationship existed or claiming that there was no risk for light or moderate drinking, as well as presenting alcohol as just one risk among many. Alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for a range of cancers, including oral cavity, liver, breast and colorectal cancers, and accounts for about 4% of new cancer cases annually in the UK. The latest British government advice on alcohol, issued last year, makes an explicit link between cancer and alcohol. It states: ""The risk of developing a range of health problems (including cancers of the mouth, throat and breast) increases the more you drink on a regular basis."" During the consultation phase the alcohol industry challenged the link with cancer. The authors of the report, published in the Drug and Alcohol Review journal, said it was important to highlight that those who drink within the recommended guidelines - not more than 14 units a week for both men and women - ""shouldn't be too concerned when it comes to cancer"". Mark Petticrew, Professor of Public Health at the LSHTM and the study's lead author, told Sky News: ""The information, on balance, across organisations we looked at seems to be quite extensively inaccurate or misrepresents the evidence. ""The evidence linking alcohol consumption and cancer is reasonably clear and has firmed up over recent years. The information on these websites, given out by alcohol bodies, appears to be not representing that evidence base, which is quite consistent. ""We know the tobacco industry attempted to confuse the relationship between lung cancer and smoking and put out a lot of very distracting information. We see similar types of argument use in these alcohol industry websites."" Institute of Alcohol Studies chief executive Katherine Brown said: ""This report shows that, like the tobacco industry before them, alcohol companies are misleading consumers about the evidence linking their products to cancer. ""We cannot rely on a profit-driven industry to promote public health. Consumers have a right to know the truth about alcohol and cancer, so they can make fully informed decisions about their drinking."" The alcohol industry denied the report's findings. Drinkaware, a charitable trust funded by drinks manufacturers, said: ""Its recent review of Drinkaware's cancer information, which is extensive, has confirmed that the information we are providing accurately reflects the most recent research evidence."" Henry Ashworth, president of the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, said: ""We do not agree with the conclusions reached in this paper. We believe in sharing the current state of the scientific evidence and stand by the information that we publish on drinking and health."" Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ""This is a diatribe disguised as a study that seeks to create a false narrative in which businesses always lie and anti-alcohol campaigners always tell the truth. ""We need to have sensible and evidence-based information about the risks of alcohol. The risks associated with cancer are not the biggest risks when it comes to drinking, the bigger risks are to do with violence, drink-driving and liver cirrhosis. ""It's not cancer, so I'm not convinced that actually people understood fully what the risks associated with drinking are in terms of cancer when it doesn't have an effect on people's consumption of it at all."""

He was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism and of being a member of the National Action group, which was banned last year. The 24-year-old is understood to be a member of the Royal Anglican Regiment. A police spokesman said a further four men arrested on Tuesday - a 22-year-old from Birmingham, a 32-year-old man arrested in Powys, a 24-year-old arrested in Ipswich and a 24-year-old arrested in Northampton - continue to be held at a police station in the West Midlands. Three of them are said to be serving in the British Army, including a member of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). Detectives have been granted more time to question the men. Police said the arrests were ""pre-planned and intelligence-led"", adding there was no threat to the public's safety. It has been a criminal offence to be a member of National Action since December 2016, when it was banned by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. At the time, Ms Rudd told Parliament: ""National Action is a racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic organisation which stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideology, and I will not stand for it. ""It has absolutely no place in a Britain that works for everyone."" The group conducts ""provocative street demonstrations and stunts aimed at intimidating local communities"", according to the official list of banned groups, which says it tries to recruit young people. The document also links National Action with the murder of MP Jo Cox in 2016. The phrase ""Death to traitors, freedom for Britain!"" - said by her right-wing extremist killer Thomas Mair in court - is associated with the group. Police say 22 members of National Action were arrested last year."

2017-09-08,"A former pole dancer dubbed the ""black widow"" is launching a rare legal case by asking a High Court judge to rule that she did not murder her millionaire husband.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170908235220/http://news.sky.com/story/black-widow-anna-ziuzina-asks-judge-to-rule-she-did-not-kill-millionaire-husband-11024627,"Ukrainian Anna Ziuzina, 38, says she is planning the action because his family are driving a political campaign, involving Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, to have her arrested and charged. She hopes it will help her inherit a share of his £2m fortune after a long courtroom battle with his family. They say she should inherit nothing because, as they told a coroner in January, they believe she murdered her husband Barry Pring. Mr Pring, a British IT consultant, died on their wedding anniversary when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver on the hard shoulder of a motorway outside Kiev. His widow said they had enjoyed a boozy celebration meal and had crossed the safety barrier to hitch a ride back into the city. She had just turned back towards the restaurant to retrieve her gloves - and, according to a witness, made a telephone call - when a car hit her husband. Earlier this year, a Devon coroner ruled that Mr Pring, 47, was killed unlawfully after being ""tricked"" into going on to the motorway, effectively pointing the finger of blame at Ms Ziuzina. She later got the coroner's conclusion quashed, arguing she was not given enough notice to attend and questioning the motives of a key witness. Ms Ziuzina is hoping to get the High Court murder ruling delivered before a new inquest is heard. Legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg said: ""It's always been the law that you can't benefit from deliberately killing someone. You can't benefit from murder or manslaughter. ""So, what she wants is for the civil court in London to decide whether she actually had a part in murdering her husband. Obviously, it's a high-risk strategy. If the court says she had a part in his murder then she doesn't benefit in any way. If they say she doesn't, she clears her name and gets to inherit."" Ms Ziuzina has never been arrested or charged. A Ukrainian police murder investigation has stalled and British police have no jurisdiction in the case. But her lawyer says in a statement to the High Court that she wants the rare ruling on her innocence because she feels there is a new, politically driven and ""dangerous threat"" to her liberty. Her lawyer, John Cabot, says Mr Pring's brother Shaughan has orchestrated a political and media campaign against her involving his local MP and the Foreign Secretary. In his court statement, Mr Cabot says: ""(She) had reasonable grounds to believe she was in peril of the Foreign Secretary having placed political pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to arrest and prosecute her for the murder of the deceased."" He says: ""It has been a long-standing concern of (hers) that action would be taken against her by the Ukrainian authorities not because of the strength of any evidence against her, but as a matter of political expediency, because of the desire at political level in the Ukraine to maintain goodwill with the British authorities."" Ms Ziuzina now lives in Marbella with her partner Ivan Lister, a wealthy British businessman, their four-year old daughter and a new baby born in February. She said nothing and slammed her garden door shut when we approached her this week. Mr Lister said he was aware of the court action, but refused to discuss it. When I congratulated him on his new baby, he replied: ""How do you know it is ours? I may have borrowed it."" In the past, Barry Pring's family have described Ms Ziuzina as a ""gold digger"" and questioned why she did not attend her husband's funeral or inquest. Mr Pring died without making a will and his estate is frozen pending the conclusion of the police investigation and inquest. His brother Shaughan and mother Irene said in a joint statement: ""We're approaching the 10th anniversary of Barry's murder. ""We've had to fight our own corner for all these years, and at our own expense. ""During this period, our much loved husband and father has died in distress and confusion as to Barry's death. ""We feel desperately let down by Devon and Cornwall Police, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British justice system. ""All we've ever wanted is justice for Barry."""

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said waves of 3.3ft (1m) had been measured off the port of Salina Cruz. Multiple aftershocks ranged between 4.5 and 5.7 in magnitude, the US Geological Survey said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the quake was the biggest his country had seen in a century. The governor of the southern Oaxaca state said at least 23 people died there. Two children were killed in the state of Tabasco. Its governor, Arturo Nunez, said one was a baby who died at a children's hospital which lost power, causing the infant's ventilator to stop working. Seven people were killed in neighbouring Chiapas state - among them two women who died in San Cristobal when a house and a wall collapsed. ""Homes, schools and hospitals have been damaged,"" state governor Manuel Velasco said. In Juchitan in Oaxaca state, parts of the town hall, plus other buildings including a hotel and a bar were reduced to rubble. People in the capital, Mexico City, ran out into the street in their pyjamas after the tremor shook buildings. Mr Pena Nieto said a million people had initially been left without power, but 800,000 had now had it restored. The quake struck at a depth of 43 miles (69 km), 76 miles (123 km) southwest of the town of Pijijiapan. It posed a potential tsunami threat to the Pacific coastlines of countries including Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama and Honduras, the US Tsunami Warning System said. Buildings in Guatemala were shaken by the tremor. ""I had never been anywhere where the earth moved so much,"" said 31-year-old architect Luis Carlos Briceno, who is visiting Mexico City. ""At first I laughed, but when the lights went out I didn't know what to do. I nearly fell over."""

Josephine Connor, former adviser to the chief minister of Anguilla, told Sky News it had left people on the ground feeling like ""third-class citizens"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also said the Government ""should have acted much faster"". British overseas territories have been battered by the deadly hurricane - with the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla suffering ""severe"" damage. The Turks and Caicos Islands declared a national shutdown as they were hit in the early hours of Friday (UK time). .As aid was being flown to the affected areas - with the first military plane to join the relief effort taking off from RAF Brize Norton - Theresa May chaired a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee. The Prime Minister has pledged £32m towards the relief effort. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We believe we were swift to respond and we are getting aid to people in need."" The Royal Navy ship Mounts Bay, which is carrying Marines, is now in Anguilla and another, HMS Ocean, is being sent to the Caribbean as part of a taskforce with several hundred troops. However, it could take the amphibious assault ship up to 10 days to arrive. But critics claim the Dutch and French governments, which also have Caribbean territories, were better prepared and quicker to respond. The Dutch military had already been on the ground in St Martin for a number of hours when the hurricane hit. Boris Johnson said ""the UK Government is doing everything it possibly can to help those affected by the hurricane"". ""We've had a ship in the area from the beginning and as you know the PM has announced a very big aid package,"" the Foreign Secretary said. And International Development Secretary Priti Patel insisted: ""It's not right to say we have been caught out. ""The reality is we've had a Royal naval vessel, Mounts Bay, in the region for some time because of the hurricane and the preparedness that was taking place in anticipation of the hurricane,"" she told Sky News. ""This has been a devastating hurricane, had enormous impact, it was very difficult to get supplies in because airports have been taken out, communications have been taken out."" The Department for International Development has sent advisers to Antigua, Barbados and Jamaica to assess the damage. But others argue the Government was too slow to act. Mr Corbyn said the disaster was ""entirely predictable"". ""The news about Hurricane Irma was well-known. The American weather forecasting system was well on top of it,"" the Labour leader said. Mrs Connor, who is in Anguilla, said: ""To tell us that you're sending us experts without a time frame and in the context where everyone knew in advance that this was going to be the largest storm ever recorded in history of the Atlantic is so unacceptable that it's really appalling. ""We in the territories feel like third-class citizens because I'd rather wager that if there were something coming like that, of the same magnitude, to the mainland UK, I suspect that there would be far more attention being paid."" Tourists stranded in affected regions have also complained about a lack of information and assistance from holiday companies. Former senior Royal Navy officer, Admiral Chris Parry, said: ""I think it's a valid criticism that we knew Hurricane Irma was coming and I think contingency plans could have been a bit sharper and a bit quicker, and we could have had forces in place in order to deal with the fallout from them."""

As a young teenager, at first I just assumed this was normal - I'd always struggled with my periods. How was I to know this wasn't just part of being a teenage girl? But the bleeding kept happening between my periods. And it was bad. I was experiencing pain like I'd never felt before and it was debilitating. Again and again I went to the doctors, but they misdiagnosed me several times. They told me I was pregnant and that I was experiencing a miscarriage. They told me that I had an STI. It wasn't until I was in college, and my symptoms were so bad that I was bleeding every day, that I finally got an answer. I was then aged 18. They sent me to a specialist, who diagnosed me with endometriosis following an operation. But things were still the same after they operated. The pain eased slightly, but prolonged bleeding and sharp pain all down my right side remained an everyday occurrence. I bled constantly for four months after my operation and ended up in A&E. A later scan revealed the cysts; one was six inches and they sat on my ovary. The doctors suspected cancer so they decided to operate again and remove both cysts. I only started noticing a real difference after my second operation. While I still got constant pain, my periods regulated and were a lot lighter thanks to the hormonal coil they had inserted during my first operation. Since then I've had a couple of trips to A&E for pain relief during particularly difficult times in my cycle, which are excruciating. I'm still learning to live with the pain on a day-to-day basis. As endometriosis is an incurable and lifelong illness, it's likely that I may be facing more surgeries and complications as I grow up. But to help me cope, I've now joined several support groups for ""endo"" sufferers and I like to get involved with other people like me via social media."

At least 14 people have been killed as Irma ripped through the Caribbean. Here is more about Irma's path of destruction so far: :: Antigua and Barbuda  These islands were the first to be hit by Irma. A two-year-old was killed on Barbuda as a family tried to escape a damaged home during the storm. Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne told Sky News the ""carnage in Barbuda is unprecedented"". About half of the island's 1,800 residents have been left homeless, and 90% of its buildings have suffered damage. Although gusts reached speeds of 230mph in Barbuda, the damage in Antigua has been described as ""nominal, to the extent that it is business as usual"". :: St Martin, Anguilla and St Barts  Four people have died on the French side of St Martin, according to French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. The Dutch Royal Navy said ""enormous damage"" had been caused on the Dutch side of the island, where at least one person died. Many houses are missing roofs and hotels are underwater, it added. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the storm had been of ""epic proportions"", causing ""widescale destruction of infrastructure, houses and businesses"". ""There is no power, no gasoline, no running water,"" he said. Mr Rutte described how some residents ""are sitting in the dark in ruined houses and are cut off from the outside world"". St Martin and Anguilla experienced heavy rain and winds of up to 185mph. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said ""severe and in places critical"" damage has been seen on Anguilla. He told MPs that the British overseas territory had taken the full force of the hurricane, and there were ""unconfirmed reports of a number of fatalities"". The Caribbean Disaster Management Agency said at least one person had died and 90% of the island's roads were impassible. Anguilla's hospital and airport have also suffered damage, as have power lines. In St Barts, damage has been described as ""apocalyptic"" following winds of 151mph. :: US Virgin Islands Authorities said three people died after Irma caused what they called ""catastrophic"" damage. The deaths occurred in the St Thomas and St John districts. Officials said crews were clearing many inaccessible roads. :: British Virgin Islands Sir Alan Duncan said the islands had suffered ""severe damage"". Sir Richard Branson, whose Necker Island is within the group, said he and friends had ""experienced a night of howling wind and rain as Hurricane Irma edges ever closer"". His son Sam Branson said on social media: ""Glad to say that all humans on Necker are ok although a lot of buildings destroyed."" In a blog post, Sir Richard described the atmosphere as ""eerie but beautiful"". The British entrepreneur and his guests were using a concrete wine cellar as a shelter. ""I suspect there will be little wine left in the cellar when we all emerge,"" he said. :: Puerto Rico Four deaths were reported in Puerto Rico. Winds of 100mph left at least 900,000 people without power and nearly 50,000 without water. An economic crisis has led to major funding and staffing cuts at the public power company. That being the case, the power supply may not be restored for up to six months. :: Dominican Republic and Haiti Irma's wind strength dipped to 175mph as she soaked the northern coasts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Thursday. :: Turks and Caicos Islands The hurricane hit this area early on Friday UK time bringing winds of around 175mph."

The attack was discovered to have run from mid-May until 29 July, but the US company has taken 40 days to inform customers that their personal details were compromised. Three senior executives at the company - which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange - sold shares worth almost $1.8m before the breach was publicly disclosed. According to Bloomberg they had not been informed of the incident at this point. The firm's shares dropped 12.4% in after-hours trading when the data breach was announced.

The 87-year-old had spent most of his adolescence around them, and his first job was working at a stable. When the large stallion arrived, Mr Saunders' bed was wheeled outside so he could pet the horse and feed them apples, carrots and mints. His daughter Jayne went to visit her father and saw him stroking the horse. She said: ""I simply didn't expect him to have an experience like that at the hospice. ""He'd actually had a couple of bad days and wasn't himself at all, but he was absolutely full of beans when I arrived and you could see the joy on his face from being able to interact with such a gorgeous animal. ""Horses have played a big part in our family's life, so this was a very special moment."" Patrick had taught his future wife Wendy to ride at his family's stables when she was just 15, and he tutored their children too. His father Victor had taught him to ride - and, in a wonderful twist of fate, the horse that came to see him was also called Victor. Patrick died three days after the visit, but Jayne said his final days had been brightened by meeting Victor. She said: ""When they told me that a horse was coming to visit dad, I thought that maybe he would be able to see the animal from his balcony. I had no idea he would be able to get so close. ""But that's what the hospice is all about, going above and beyond."" Cathy Whattingham, one of the nurses caring for Patrick, said: ""His passion for horses was so clear and they'd obviously played a big part in his life. ""We happen to be next door to the North Devon Equine Rescue Centre, so we thought we'd see if they might be able to bring a horse to the hospice to visit Patrick.

Thomas Cook said it had offered pilots a 4% pay rise over two years, in addition to automatic annual increases. The union is seeking much more than that, and wants a one-year deal to be in excess of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation rate, which came in at 3.6% in July, and to include various other components of pilot remuneration. It is the first strike by UK pilots since 1974, the union said, adding three further strikes would take place on 23 and 29 September, plus one on 6 October, if the dispute is not resolved. BALPA said its members voted heavily in favour of Friday's walkout ""extremely reluctantly"" in protest at year-on-year, real-terms pay cuts, and cuts to terms and conditions. ""They welcome the news that many flights are expected to operate as usual during the 12-hour strike. But they say they want the company to understand just how resolute pilots are and how frustrated they are with the company's uncompromising stance,"" BALPA said. General secretary Brian Strutton added: ""Going on strike is not something pilots take lightly. Balpa members haven't been on strike since 1974, but with no sensible pay offer on the table, Thomas Cook pilots have had no other option. ""The time has come for Thomas Cook to understand the depth of feeling on this issue, listen to its pilots and come forward with a reasonable offer that they can accept."" The union added it remains committed to finding a solution to the dispute. Thomas Cook said it was ""disappointed"" BALPA had announced further strikes, with a spokesman saying: ""We have set out a fair pay increase of 1.75% in year one and 2.25% increase in year two, on top of automatic pay increases, in what is a very competitive environment. ""Balpa have not moved from their demands for a pay rise which adds up to more than 10%, or around £10,000 per pilot. ""We hope Balpa come back to the table willing to negotiate. ""We are grateful to our customers for their understanding and to our pilots who are flying today, as well as staff who are working hard to keep the impact of this strike to a minimum.

Ministers are likely to approve a cash injection so long as they are satisfied there is still a realistic chance of discovering the fate of Madeleine, who was nearly four when she vanished during a family holiday in Portugal in 2007. Detectives from the Metropolitan Police and their Portuguese colleagues have worked together for more than a year to find clues to corroborate their theory. Sky News understands that phase of their investigation is complete and their success will hinge on technical results of their work. The money they are asking for is unlikely to be a large amount, effectively enough to keep a small number of detectives - three or four - on little more than a watching brief. The request should be approved in the next week or so. The Home Office has funded the six-year investigation with £11.2m since it began in 2011. The first year cost £1.9m, but the annual amounts have gradually reduced. In April, detectives were given £85,000 to keep going until the end of this month. On the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance, the Met's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: ""I know we have a significant line of inquiry which is worth pursuing and because it's worth pursuing it could provide an answer. ""But until we've gone through it, I don't know if we are going to get there or not."" Madeleine vanished in May 2007 from a ground-floor holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on the Algarve coast. She had been left sleeping in a room with her younger brother and sister while her parents Kate and Gerry McCann dined nearby with friends. The couple said they made regular checks on their three children and discovered Madeleine was missing around 10pm, insisting she had been abducted. The original Portuguese police investigation was closed after 15 months without establishing any firm clues. It was reopened in 2011. The McCanns, who were considered suspects but then cleared of suspicion, hired a series of private investigators without success. Eventually, they appealed to then prime minister David Cameron, who agreed to ask Scotland Yard to review all the gathered evidence and later start its own inquiry. Early ideas about sex predators, child traffickers and ""a burglary gone wrong"" were largely dismissed before both detective teams joined forces to focus on the latest theory."

So which flare produced the stunning Aurora Borealis? It seems that both were responsible in a way, with the earlier flare clearing the way for the latter.

Suddenly there's a commotion, lots of shouting and people rushing around. A platoon of Myanmar army soldiers have been sighted. They are marching along the brow of the hill just behind a barbed wire fence. There about 90 soldiers. All are heavily armed, carrying assault rifles and belt-fed machine guns. On their backs they carry large baskets. The situation turns tense. The refugees stop whatever they are doing and watch the soldiers file past. These could be the same soldiers who are raping, slaughtering and burning down Rohingya villages. They are just metres apart. A Bangladesh border guard tells me Myanmar soldiers are laying landmines along the border. He points our team towards proof. Near the crossing point where the creek is narrowest I find a man called Dil Muhammad. He is a village elder and shows me an extremely distressing mobile video of a Rohingya woman. She has had both her legs blown off from the knee down. She is then carefully wrapped in a sheet, picked up and carried by some men across the creek. The video ends. Dil Mohammed tells me the explosion happened a few days ago: ""She was walking from her village towards the camp when she stepped on the mine. ""We brought here here and there were doctors from Medecins Sans Frontieres. They happened to be in the village."" The team of medics were able to stop the potentially catastrophic blood loss and take the woman to hospital for lifesaving treatment. She is not the only recent landmine victim. A border guard shows me a photograph of a child on his phone. The boy is about 10 or 11 years old. He is lying on the floor. His left leg from just below the waist has been blown off. His right leg is badly injured too. Myanmar's defacto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, says the world has been duped by Rohingya propaganda. :: Tutu condemns Aung San Suu Kyi's silence over Rohingya crisis But the pictures and videos we have seen are consistent with the injuries sustained from landmine explosions. The witness accounts also contradict her claim. Myanmar stands accused of ethnic cleansing. Driving the Rohingya from their burning homes and then preventing them from returning by laying landmines would be a deadly way of doing it."

Steve Gooding, the motoring research charity's director, said: ""While one in five miles driven by car takes place on a motorway, for many motorists these roads remain a mystery. ""The challenge is to make motorways as welcoming and safe as possible, so those people who only use them once in a blue moon feel comfortable doing so."" In August Transport Secretary Chris Grayling announced plans to allow learner drivers on motorways to better prepare them for independent driving after passing the test. AA president Edmund King said: ""One of the features this new research reveals is the wisdom in making the proposed motorway element of driver training voluntary. ""With nearly 30% of the population without a motorway in their area, making it compulsory would make it difficult for learners in the Highlands, the West Country and other rural areas to pass their test. ""If they move to another part of the country where they need to go on a motorway, the opportunity to get a familiarisation course is still available to them."""

Until now. The detailed 82-page paper leaked by The Guardian may only be a draft - peppered with references to the need to consult - but it is the first, tantalising indication of Government thinking, and it is far from business as usual. Theresa May has been clear since she took office that she wants the migration numbers to come down and believes that is what people voted for. Despite the weakness of her leadership, I'm told she has been ""immovable"" on this point in Cabinet discussions. :: Long read: The unpredictable three months ahead The proposals are that low-skilled migrants would get a maximum two years' of residency in Britain and high-skilled, from doctors to bankers and nuclear scientists, up to five years when free movement ends. The priorities are set out as making ""existing residents better off"" and forcing businesses to give jobs to ""resident labour"" from Britain, rather than adding points to our GDP. For big employers, this is the ""cliff edge"" many had feared. And not only big firms, but employers like the NHS, which has 10% of its doctors and 4% of nurses from the EU. The aim of paying higher wages to British workers was not supposed to mean a higher agency fee bill for the cash-strapped health service. The construction, social care, agriculture and hospitality sectors each rely on more than 100,000 migrants to meet their requirements - what the Prime Minister says is a sustainable level for net migration across the board. Who leaked it and to what end? The Home Office is already looking internally at who had access to it, but the draft was also circulated to other relevant departments including the Treasury and Department for Exiting the EU. The leak to the Guardian, a newspaper hostile to the Government's immigration policies, may provide clues. But the leak itself could be played to Mrs May's advantage. There is no estimate in there of the impact of the proposed policies, it is all about ""control"". As one Government insider put it to me: ""Whether it ends up being - 100,000 or 150,000 - the public want to see that the Government have a handle on it and is making the decisions."" Anyway, the net migration figures may not drop by anything like that much. Strict restrictions on income and work already apply to migrants from outside the EU, from which net migration was running at 266,000 in the six months to May; in an area the Government can already control. Is it damaging? Labour's official reaction has been noticeably muted, although pro-European backbenchers have branded the proposals ""mean and cynical"" and there has been anger from London mayor Sadiq Khan, as well as from Nicola Sturgeon. In a statement, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott simply said the party would wait for the Government's official proposals, expected in a white paper in the coming weeks and then published in an immigration bill early next year. While the Labour Party is still divided on its own approach to immigration, it's not very easy to throw stones. Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, has given the PM staunch support this morning. Instead of refusing to comment on the leak, he tacitly endorsed the approach saying people voted for control of migration, and that ministers would need to strike a balance. How these proposals will be received by our negotiating partners in Brussels, how to upskill Britain's population and how this approach fits into the Government's plans to turbo-charge building of homes and infrastructure are yet to be hammered out. And with no Conservative majority in Parliament, the Prime Minister must wait and see how much dissent there is in her party. But the thorniest issue of all - immigration - could not wait forever."

His comments were made as new pictures showed Kim Jong Un attending an event in honour of the country's nuclear scientists and technicians. The celebrations followed an announcement by the nation's state media claiming the regime had detonated a hydrogen bomb with ""perfect success"". Sir Michael said the UK was ""working flat out at the United Nations to get a better resolution there to enforce the existing sanctions. ""We're looking at sanctions across the European Union, and of course we're trying to persuade China to keep its neighbour in check."" North Korea has already launched an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the US mainland, according to some experts.

London is closer to North Korea and its missiles than Los Angeles."" London is almost 600 miles closer to Pyongyang (5,370 miles/8,650km) than Los Angeles (5,930 miles/9,550km), but any launch targeting the UK would need to travel over the airspace of another nuclear power - Russia. Regarding the threat of armed conflict, Russian president Vladimir Putin said: ""I am sure that things will not go as far as a large-scale conflict, especially with the use of weapons of mass destruction."" Sir Michael said that North Korea did ""not yet"" have the ability to strike London, but added: ""They are clearly accelerating their missile programme. ""The range is getting longer and longer and we have to get this programme halted because the dangers now of miscalculation, of some accident triggering a response, are extremely great.

A decision is due on Tuesday. The main roads around the 5,000-year-old site are clogged daily with commuters and tourists and the A303 is often labelled as Britain's worst bottleneck. The Government wants to build a 1.8-mile long tunnel underneath Stonehenge, which it says it would be deep enough not to damage the archaeology of the site. The National Trust backs the plan. It does not want nearby roads widened because, it argues, they could be seen from the site. However, some Trust members, such as Kate Fielden, are now urging it not to support the plan. Ms Fielden, who is also secretary of the Stonehenge Alliance, said: ""The deep cuttings, the lights, the gantries, the signage - all those things that go with a... four-lane highway - will damage the integrity - by the sight and sound of it - of a number of really important monuments in this landscape."" She added: ""Stonehenge has been designated a site of outstanding universal value by UNESCO and I think it would be very poor of us as humanity to treat it in such a disrespectful manner."" It is a fear shared by many archaeologists, who believe it could mean Stonehenge losing its World Heritage Status, reserved for the globe's most historically valuable sites. UNESCO is not ruling it out. Isabelle Anatole-Gabriel, Chief of Europe and North America at UNESCO, said: ""We are not there, we have to assess first what are the potential impacts of any changes which might occur on the values of the site and on its integrity."" The organisation has already advised the Government not to go ahead with the tunnel as it is planned; previously ruling in a report in June that the development would cause ""considerable damage"". But for many who live nearby, they have had to endure two decades of traffic jams that completely clog the A303 and send cars trying to avoid the queues through neighbouring villages. Janice Hassett, from the Stonehenge Traffic Action Group, said: ""Our village of Shrewton is packed with traffic every day and older people can't even cross the road to get to the doctors' surgery."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are investing up to £1.8bn to improve the A303 near Stonehenge so that people can visit the 10,000 acre World Heritage site without the disruption of a nearby major road. ""We are working closely with Historic England, the National Trust and English Heritage to develop these plans and they have welcomed the significant benefits our proposals will bring to the protection of Stonehenge. ""Upgrading the road will cut congestion, improve journey times and provide a huge boost to the economy in the South West as it links people with jobs and businesses with customers."""

Although power has been restored to 320,000 buildings, utility companies it may take weeks before infrastructure torn down by the storm is rebuilt.

Trauma specialists and mental health professionals were also on hand. The event comes three and a half months after Manchester resident Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in the venue's foyer as people left an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Poet Tony Walsh also recited his poem This Is The Place before the music began. He moved some people to tears when he performed the poem at a vigil at Manchester town hall the day after the attack.

Thousands at the concert again drew meaning from the anthem, singing together as the chorus rang out around the arena."
2017-09-10,Politicians have dismissed former prime minister Tony Blair's plan to stop Brexit by negotiating new EU freedom of movement rules.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170911011049/http://news.sky.com/story/tony-blairs-bid-to-stop-brexit-with-tougher-immigration-rules-hopeless-11029040,"Mr Blair says introducing tougher immigration policies would fulfil the will of Brexit voters so make it unnecessary for the UK to leave the bloc. The institute he founded after he left Downing Street in 2007 has written a policy document that says Brexit is not ""the sole, or even the best way to"" overcome ""public anxiety about immigration"". It says the Government should ""seek to negotiate a strengthened 'emergency brake'"" to put in place ""temporary controls on free movement"" which would allow ""control over immigration"" while leaving open the option of ""remaining within the EU"". But former Chancellor Ken Clarke told Sky News such a plan was ""hopeless"", while Conservative minister Dominic Raab said his idea had been tried already and been unsuccessful. Mr Blair told BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""I think you could argue in Europe today for an emergency brake that didn't just deal with benefits, but also dealt with the influx of people and I think there are things we could do domestically like registering people that come in and those that go out. ""This is post the Brexit vote. At the moment, you either do leave, or we have the status quo. Brexit is a distraction not a solution to the problems this country faces. ""If members of parliament really believe that, then their obligation is to set out solutions and deal with the actual problems people have and not do Brexit which is going to distract us from those solutions."" But the Government's justice minister Dominic Raab said: ""Tony Blair was the guy that introduced the open door immigration we are now trying to resolve because the public feel very concerned about it. ""We've also tried to get the kind of deal that he talked about with the EU and the EU said no. And then there is the small matter of the referendum when the British people decided to leave the EU and we are going to deliver that."" Ken Clarke, who was in the Cabinet until 2012 and was against Brexit before the referendum last year, said: ""Tony still thinks we can stay in the EU. I think the mood in the country... It's hopeless to expect that. ""What we now need to address is the practical consequences, what's our new relationship. The single market and the customs union simply mean we don't start putting new barriers between ourselves and our biggest single market. That, we probably can achieve."" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Marr: ""It's a bit late now this epiphany, I'm not sure where he's been - well we know where he's been, he's being travelling the world. He added: ""The country has decided we're leaving the European Union, we've got to get on with that."" Labour also said it is committed to Brexit. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told Sky News: ""Brexit is going to go ahead. The British people voted for Brexit, but we are trying to do is get a deal that safeguards jobs and the economy."" The criticism of Mr Blair comes as Parliament prepares to vote on the first reading of the EU Withdrawal bill, which will move thousands of pieces of EU law into domestic legislation."

Froome's victory means he has become only the third man in history to complete the double of winning Le Tour and La Vuelta in the same season. The Team Sky rider is also the first cyclist to do the Tour-Vuelta double since La Vuelta was moved after Le Tour in the cycling calendar. Lots of hugs and congratulations at the finish line. #LV2017🇪🇸 is finally complete. One happy team! pic.twitter.com/nUZdXIVwTS The 32-year-old's fifth Grand Tour victory puts him joint seventh on the all-time list of Grand Tour wins per rider. Italy's Matteo Trentin won Sunday's stage, as Froome enjoyed a traditional parade into the Spanish capital clad in the race leader's red jersey. Froome's high placing in the final stage was also enough to see him win the green points jersey, pipping Trentin. Although he is some way from the record 11 Grand Tour wins of Belgian Eddy Merckx, Froome is closely approaching Spaniard Alberto Contador's seven victories. Contador himself, who will now retire, won the penultimate stage of La Vuelta on Saturday, the infamously steep and uneven climb up the challenging Angliru mountain road. Froome may be prioritising a fifth Tour de France title in 2018, but having bagged a La Vuelta title on his sixth attempt, the cyclist's sights could be set on the third of the Grand Tours: the Giro d'Italia in May. His La Vuelta victory is the first time Team Sky have won a Grand Tour other than Le Tour de France."

They gathered in Parliament Square to hear Sir Bob Geldof and former Liberal Democrat cabinet minister Sir Ed Davey talk about remaining within the European Union. The rally comes ahead of a Parliament vote on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill on Monday, which opponents have described as a ""power grab"" by the Government. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, said the bill amounted to an ""affront to Parliament"", a claim which Brexit secretary David Davis said was ""cynical and unprincipled"". Sir Ed told the crowd: ""I've gone from anger to distress, from fury to despair. But since the Brexit negotiations begun there's a third emotion I've been feeling: Embarrassment. ""Embarrassment at our country's leaders. Embarrassment for Great Britain."" The Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, has said he is ""rock solid confident"" the UK will clinch a deal with the EU after Brexit. The People's March For Europe, as the rally had been named, saw attendees waving European flags and carrying signs urging each other to reject Brexit. Some were wearing blue t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan ""Remoaner Till I Die"" while others wore blue wigs and berets. Jean Lambert, an MEP for London, said that she wanted the British public to have another say on the matter at the end of the negotiating process - just as she would have as an MEP. ""I want a similar meaningful vote for people in Westminster,"" she said. ""Not a gift from the Government but a right. And I also want a vote for the people of this country. ""Even basic consumer protection says you have a cooling-off period, a time to consider whether or not you are being offered what fits your needs and your ambition. ""So a vote for the people, not just the politicians."""

Ms Harman said that 17 babies have been born to women MPs since 2010, but they have not benefited from a system of leave. She has submitted her proposals to the Speaker's Commons Reference Group on representation and inclusion, which meets next week. Speaking before a Labour event in Newcastle, Ms Harman said: ""Women have babies - that is a fact of life. Women are in Parliament - that's a democratic imperative. ""The baby needs time with the mother, the mother needs time with the baby and the constituency needs to be properly represented at all times. ""We need a proper system of baby leave to square that circle. It's long overdue."" She added: ""The reality is you cannot be on call for your constituency or voting when you are in labour. ""And you should not have to be on duty when your baby is only a few weeks/months old. ""But the constituency must have a representative at all times. There needs to be a proper system of leave and cover."" Ms Harman said the parliamentary system makes no acknowledgement that male MPs are also fathering babies, saying Parliament ""needs to set a proper example on leave"". ""During my 35 years as MP I've had three children. Eighteen months' leave for three babies during 35 years' work doesn't seem too much to ask,"" she added."

2017-09-10,Labour has refused to rule out supporting a coordinated strike over the issue of the 1% public sector pay cap.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170911011049/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-refuses-to-rule-out-general-strike-support-over-public-sector-pay-cap-11029205,"Four unions have tabled motions to this week's Trades Union Congress in Brighton calling for some kind of nationally coordinated action. Asked by Sky whether Labour would support any union-backed action, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said his party supports anyone who strikes for ""industrial reasons"". He said: ""People go on strike for industrial reasons, they don't go on strike for political reasons and ... the Labour Party supports people who take industrial action. ""But we don't want it to get to that stage. We don't want to see a strike. We don't want to see nurses going on strike and wider public servants going on strike. ""The way to avoid that is for the Government to understand the concerns of public sector workers and get rid of this unfair pay cap."" Mr Ashworth said Labour is aiming to force a Commons vote on scrapping the pay cap. Any vote on the motion would be non-binding on the Government but the Opposition is seeking to capitalise on Conservative support for public sector workers to receive a pay increase and Theresa May's lack of majority to pressure her to take action sooner than previously hinted. A former top Treasury official has labelled the cap unsustainable in the long-term. Mr Ashworth called on Tory MPs to join his party in backing moves to end the ""unfair"" cap on Wednesday, when a motion will be debated. Mr Ashworth told Sky News's Sunday with Niall Paterson: ""What the Government needs to do is understand the concerns of the people who work in our National Health Service and wider public services and get rid of this pay cap. ""We keep getting briefings in newspapers and suggestions that the Government is sympathetic and wants to do something, and 'Oh, it's terrible and we accept that but let's see where we get to'. ""We're bringing a vote to the House of Commons on Wednesday and those Conservative Members of Parliament who have sincerely said they believe the pay cap should go, we're calling on them to vote with us and I'm calling on your viewers to lobby those Conservative Members of Parliament and let me know what they say."" The TUC Congress agenda says delegates will debate a motions from the Public and Commercial Services Union, calling for ""a coordinated strategy of opposition... including...industrial action"", the Educational Institute of Scotland calling for ""coordinated campaigns, including industrial action... to end public sector pay restraint"", the Fire Brigades Union calling for ""immediate steps to commence a campaign for joint and sustained industrial action"" and the Prison Officers Association, which calls for ""Congress (to) direct all public sector unions within the TUC to organise and co-ordinate collective action"". TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady told Sky News: ""Five million public servants have put up with seven long years of no real pay rise. We want to see the cap scrapped but we also want no cherry picking. ""The Government has got to start listening. Strikes are always the last resort. But public servants have put up with seven... years of no real pay increase and of course they are angry."" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said last week that the Government understood that civil servants, teachers, health workers and council staff have taken their ""share of the pain"" of deficit reduction and indicated the Chancellor was looking at the issue. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said if public sector pay were to rise in line with inflation for the next three or four years, the Treasury would have to find between £6bn and £7bn more than if it continued with the cap."

The data shows that for every 100,000 people in north central and east London, there are approximately 13 consultant psychiatrists available to provide specialist mental health care on the NHS, while the East of England and Yorkshire and Humber benefit from less than half that number - just five for every 100,000 people. Those in Wales have an average of just six consultant psychiatrists for every 100,000 members of the population, compared to 10 in Scotland. The Government has pledged extra funding for mental health, but the Royal College fears that there are simply not enough medical students choosing to specialise in psychiatric care compared to other disciplines. Dr Sri Kalidindi, from the executive committee of rehabilitation and social psychiatry at RCPsych, told Sky News: ""The Government have promised over 500 more consultant psychiatrists by 2020 for that to happen we do need to increase the number of medical students who choose psychiatry to go into as a profession. ""So some of the support is there but more needs to be done."" Sarah Holmes was just 17 when she was referred to a mental health unit over 300 miles from her home in Hartlepool. The treatment she needed wasn't available any nearer. After a traumatic incident when she was 13, Sarah began self harming, almost losing her legs through infection. Several times she tried to take her own life. ""When I was being treated nearer home I had my family there to talk to. My mum used to visit me three or four times a week,"" she says. ""We just talked rubbish, but it reminded me that I did have things to live for. ""When I was so far away I didn't want to stop self harming. I felt I had nothing to live for."" Sarah has since received more appropriate treatment, and now works for her local Mental Health Trust. But she fears that if the shortage of senior psychiatrists continues it could be potentially life-threatening for many patients. ""The last time I needed to see someone, the waiting list was three months,"" she says. ""By the time I saw the consultant I was almost at crisis point. ""If someone is already close to that point by the time they look for help, the help could be too late."" To address the issue, RCPsych has launched a campaign to encourage more students to consider mental health as a career. Called Choose Psychiatry, it goes live from today."

As a young teenager, at first I just assumed this was normal - I'd always struggled with my periods. How was I to know this wasn't just part of being a teenage girl? But the bleeding kept happening between my periods. And it was bad. I was experiencing pain like I'd never felt before and it was debilitating. Again and again I went to the doctors, but they misdiagnosed me several times. They told me I was pregnant and that I was experiencing a miscarriage. They told me that I had an STI. It wasn't until I was in college, and my symptoms were so bad that I was bleeding every day, that I finally got an answer. I was then aged 18. They sent me to a specialist, who diagnosed me with endometriosis following an operation. But things were still the same after they operated. The pain eased slightly, but prolonged bleeding and sharp pain all down my right side remained an everyday occurrence. I bled constantly for four months after my operation and ended up in A&E. A later scan revealed the cysts; one was six inches and they sat on my ovary. The doctors suspected cancer so they decided to operate again and remove both cysts. I only started noticing a real difference after my second operation. While I still got constant pain, my periods regulated and were a lot lighter thanks to the hormonal coil they had inserted during my first operation. Since then I've had a couple of trips to A&E for pain relief during particularly difficult times in my cycle, which are excruciating. I'm still learning to live with the pain on a day-to-day basis. As endometriosis is an incurable and lifelong illness, it's likely that I may be facing more surgeries and complications as I grow up. But to help me cope, I've now joined several support groups for ""endo"" sufferers and I like to get involved with other people like me via social media."

He joked that talk of leadership elections tends to take place whenever serious subjects, like Brexit, are being discussed. Among the MPs being talked about as a potential replacement for Mrs May is pro-Brexit Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is on record as saying he opposes abortion under any circumstances. But Mr Clarke's analysis did not appear to anticipate Mrs May being leader at the next election, saying instead that he thinks she will be around for two or three years. He said: ""Theresa May is there. There is no prospect of her being replaced by anybody sensible, in any sensible process. ""For the next two or three years, Theresa has got the job of presiding over a smooth transition, through a long transition period, to an arrangement that, at least, will minimise the damage in a few years' time."" He added: ""Whenever the Conservative party can't think of anything to do, it tends to have a leadership crisis, when it's rather puzzled by policies. ""The things we've been talking about (like Brexit)… they are quite complicated. They are difficult. ""Eurosceptic campaigners offered simplicity - It's all Brussels' fault…. leave the EU and with one bound we are free and a brave new world will emerge. Well, that is nonsense. ""It's no use diverting ourselves by saying 'Would Jacob Rees-Mogg be a 21st century prime minister?' Mr Clarke went on: ""Our economy is in a very worrying state. We need, as soon as possible, an assurance that... in trade terms our arrangements with Europe are going to carry on for some years as they are now. ""It's our children and our grandchildren we should be thinking about. Not next week's newspaper headline."" Dominic Raab, the justice minister, was asked whether he would consider taking over from Mrs May, after he came third in a recent Conservative Home survey to see who readers would prefer. He said: ""If I was working for a business and I was walking around the canteen with other workers, talking about who was going to be the next boss, talking about that with clients, most people think it would be rude and grossly unprofessional, which is why I'm not going to give that tittle-tattle any succour at all."""

As a result, he said, Parliament should respect the will of the people when it decides whether to back the Government on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. Labour has said it will vote against the legislation, arguing so-called ""Henry VIII"" powers in the Bill amount to a ""power-grab"". The powers are named after a statutory instrument used by the Tudor king to force through new laws without full parliamentary scrutiny. Sources estimate around a dozen Labour MPs from Leave-backing constituencies could rebel against Jeremy Corbyn's orders. Liberal Democrats, who will oppose the legislation, have urged the Labour leader to sack any frontbenchers who defy the whip. Several Tory MPs have expressed how unhappy they are with the Bill but are expected to back it after the conclusion of its second reading, late on Monday or in the early hours of Tuesday. But it is understood they are prepared to back amendments in the future, which could leave the minority Government having to make concessions to avoid defeat Ahead of the debate, Mr Davis said: ""A vote against this Bill is a vote for a chaotic exit from the European Union. ""The British people did not vote for confusion and neither should Parliament. ""Providing certainty and stability in the lead up to our withdrawal is a key priority. ""Businesses and individuals need reassurance that there will be no unexpected changes to our laws after exit day and that is exactly what the repeal bill provides. ""Without it, we would be approaching a cliff edge of uncertainty which is not in the interest of anyone. ""That's why I'm urging all MPs of all parts of the UK to come together in support of this crucial legislation so that we can leave the European Union safe in the knowledge that we are ready for day one of exit."" The Lib Dems' Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""The chance to inflict a historic defeat against the Government's hard Brexit plans rests on whether Jeremy Corbyn can show leadership and keep his party united. ""Corbyn must show the same ruthlessness towards his pro-Brexit MPs as he has to pro-European ones in the past."" Mr Corbyn sacked three frontbenchers who defied the party whip and failed to vote for an amendment tabled by Chuka Umunna in favour of staying in the single market. The Bill overturns the 1972 Act which took Britain into the European Economic Community. In doing so, it incorporates EU laws onto the UK statute book. The votes are likely to take place in the early hours of Tuesday morning. On the general issue of Brexit, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told Sky News on Sunday that Labour had not performed a u-turn by seeking to remain in the single market during a transition phase as the party had only ever sought to protect jobs and the economy. He said: ""We are not blocking Brexit. But what we are trying to do is get a deal that safeguards jobs and the economy."""

They are all accused of being part of the banned neo-Nazi group National Action, and two allegedly possessed articles that could be used for terrorism. National Action, described by the Home Office as ""virulently racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic"", became the first extreme right-wing organisation to be banned under anti-terrorism laws in December 2016. The trio are due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. The charges came after a number of people were detained by officers from West Midlands Police Counter Terrorism Unit last week. The force said the arrests were pre-planned and intelligence-led and there was no risk to the public's safety. A man from Northampton and another from Ipswich, both aged 24, were released without charge on Saturday following inquiries. Detectives said Vehvilainen, from Sennybridge Camp, Brecon, Powys, is charged with one count of being a member of a proscribed organisation, namely National Action. He is also accused of one count of possessing a document containing information of the kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. He is also charged with two counts of publishing written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting, by posting comments on a website intending thereby to stir up racial hatred or where having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up. Barrett, from Dhekelia Garrison in Cyprus, is charged with one count of being a member of National Action. Meanwhile, Deakin, from Great Barr, Birmingham, is charged with one count of being a member of National Action. He is also charged with two counts under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 − possession of documents likely to be useful to a person preparing to commit an act of terrorism. Deakin is also accused of one count of distribution of a terrorist publication. He is charged separately with one count of inciting racial hatred.

2017-09-11,"A shortage of senior psychiatrists has led to a ""postcode lottery"" for mental health care, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/postcode-lottery-for-those-needing-psychiatric-care-11030198,"Using data published by NHS digital, RCPsych says there were 12% more referrals to mental health providers in the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period of the previous year. The data shows that for every 100,000 people in north central and east London, there are approximately 13 consultant psychiatrists available to provide specialist mental health care on the NHS, while the East of England and Yorkshire and Humber benefit from less than half that number - just five for every 100,000 people. Those in Wales have an average of just six consultant psychiatrists for every 100,000 members of the population, compared to 10 in Scotland. The Government has pledged extra funding for mental health, but the Royal College fears that there are simply not enough medical students choosing to specialise in psychiatric care compared to other disciplines. Dr Sri Kalidindi, from the executive committee of rehabilitation and social psychiatry at RCPsych, told Sky News: ""The Government have promised over 500 more consultant psychiatrists by 2020 for that to happen we do need to increase the number of medical students who choose psychiatry to go into as a profession. ""So some of the support is there but more needs to be done."" Sarah Holmes was just 17 when she was referred to a mental health unit over 300 miles from her home in Hartlepool. The treatment she needed wasn't available any nearer. After a traumatic incident when she was 13, Sarah began self harming, almost losing her legs through infection. Several times she tried to take her own life. ""When I was being treated nearer home I had my family there to talk to. My mum used to visit me three or four times a week,"" she says. ""We just talked rubbish, but it reminded me that I did have things to live for. ""When I was so far away I didn't want to stop self harming. I felt I had nothing to live for."" Sarah has since received more appropriate treatment, and now works for her local Mental Health Trust. But she fears that if the shortage of senior psychiatrists continues it could be potentially life-threatening for many patients. ""The last time I needed to see someone, the waiting list was three months,"" she says. ""By the time I saw the consultant I was almost at crisis point. ""If someone is already close to that point by the time they look for help, the help could be too late."" To address the issue, RCPsych has launched a campaign to encourage more students to consider mental health as a career. Called Choose Psychiatry, it goes live from today."
2017-09-11,The tale of seven children against a demonic clown has been able to defy the worst box office summer in a decade.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/adaptation-of-stephen-kings-it-breaks-horror-record-and-box-office-curse-11030663,"Just like Pennywise's chilling red balloon, the latest Stephen King adaptation to hit cinemas is floating high at the US box office. According to Warner Bros, 'It' should make a staggering $117.2m (£88m) from 4,103 locations in the United States, becoming the most successful horror film to ever premiere in the country. The R-rated film is also the third largest box office open since the start of the year and the highest grossing Stephen King adaptation of all time. These are surprising numbers considering the box office curse which has been haunting the US, with the number of cinema tickets sold hitting a 16-year low. This year was the first in a decade not to cross the $4bn line in domestic ticket sales. ""We blew past everyone's most optimistic and aggressive projections and I think there might be room for us to grow this weekend even still,"" said Jeff Goldstein of Warner Bros. The film follows a group of seven children, known as the Loser's Club, in the town of Derry, Maine, as they come across a demonic force which takes the form of their biggest fears. It's most famous metamorphosis is called Pennywise the Clown, and was immortalised on the small screen by Tim Curry, in the 1990 mini-series. The film was made to score around $35m, and faced many production setbacks, including losing its original writer and director, True Detective's Cary Joji Fukunaga. Fukunaga dropped the project after clashing with the studio over the film's tone. Warner Bros wanted to leave King's more violent, gritty and psychedelic details off the film, while Fukunaga wanted to make a different kind of horror film. The project was eventually taken on by Andy Muschietti, the director of the 2013 horror flick Mama. In the UK, it topped the box office in the opening weekend with £9m across 604 cinemas. ""It is the film that everyone is talking about, whether fans of the genre or not, driving moviegoers across the UK and Ireland to brave the cinema for their own encounter with Pennywise,"" Goldstein said. ""We couldn't be more thrilled with the results, and congratulate New Line Cinema, director Andy Muschietti and his phenomenal cast and crew on this fantastic opening."" 'It' is playing in cinemas across the UK."

That was largely attributed to a growing number of firms in the sector looking to hedge their bets - given continuing Brexit uncertainty - by either planning to open new offices or boost staffing in such cities in order to maintain access to EU customers and markets after the UK leaves. The report found Frankfurt - home to the European Central Bank - moving up to 11th in the world league table from 23rd a year ago. :: Brexit to create 80,000 jobs in Frankfurt - report Dublin stood in 30th place from 33rd. The study, conducted in June, saw New York remain in second place but lose ground on London. Its authors said the gap between the two was at its widest since the survey began in 2007. They speculated that this was down to fears about US trade deals in the wake of Donald Trump's election as US President. He has already pulled the country out of the planned trans-Pacific trade agreement. TheCityUK, which represents London's financial sector, said the findings should not be greeted with complacency and appealed for more information from the Government on its plans for a transition period after the UK is due to leave the EU in 2019. Its chief executive, Miles Celic, said: ""Absent this, many firms have already started to activate their contingency plans and others will undoubtedly follow suit if these aren't confirmed as soon as possible - and by the end of the year at the very latest."""

He said: ""The men in the church were able to restrain him until the police and paramedics came."" The church said the three suffered non-life threatening injuries, and West Midlands Police said a 33-year-old man was being treated in hospital. Officers were called to the church, in the Aston area of Birmingham, at 10.50am on Sunday morning. A 47-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder and two counts of wounding and possession of a bladed weapon.

In a statement on a possible ramping up of sanctions, North Korea's foreign ministry promised moves that would ""cause the US the greatest pain and suffering it had ever gone through in its entire history"". The United States originally proposed the Security Council impose an oil embargo, halt textile exports and impose a travel and financial ban on leader Kim Jong Un. It presented the proposals, which represented a departure from what had been military-focused rhetoric from Donald Trump, for a vote of the 15-member council. But on Sunday night US officials appeared to tone down their demands, scrapping the asset freeze and softening restrictions on North Koreans working overseas. Analysts suggest the changes are an attempt to encourage support for the measures from Russia and China, both of which maintain ties with North Korea. Recent months have seen an alarming escalation in tensions between the isolated Korean state and the US, with Pyongyang launching increasingly ambitious missile tests and Mr Trump promising ""fire and fury"" in response. On 3 September Mr Kim provoked global outrage with a test of what North Korea claimed was a hydrogen bomb. The latest Security Council vote is regarded as a test of the international community's resolve on the crisis, and private talks on its content have been ongoing between China and the US. Britain's UN ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, said ""maximum possible pressure"" should be placed on North Korea and offered support for the US proposals."
2017-09-11,"More than 300,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh following a two-week surge in violence in majority Buddhist Myanmar, formerly Burma.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/rohingyas-flee-myanmar-all-hell-breaks-loose-in-makeshift-camps-11031088,"Aid officials said refugee camps in the neighbouring country were reaching capacity, as fleeing Rohingyas claimed security forces and Buddhist mobs in Rakhine state had attacked them and set fire to their homes. The violence began on 25 August, when an ethnic Rohingya insurgent group attacked police posts in Myanmar and security forces retaliated. The UN has condemned what it called a cruel military operation against the minority community and said it appeared to be a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". But the Myanmar government has dismissed the Rohingya claims, with leader Aung San Suu Kyi blaming fake news and a misinformation campaign. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has joined the chorus of criticism against her and the military. He said: ""There can be no doubt the treatment of the Rohingya is a disgrace and I'm afraid it is damaging the reputation of Burma. ""All of us that wish Aung San Suu Kyi well... hope she will be able to use her leadership to get the military to do the right thing for that beleaguered and oppressed minority."" At a camp, the scene is one of utter chaos, with hundreds of people pushing and shoving. The aid workers shout, trying to keep order. Some are wielding large sticks and threatening to whip the refugees into line. Empty threat or not, it has little effect. These people are too desperate to care. Screaming babies add to the cacophony; the sound of hunger. I am just outside the Balokhali camp, about a 90-minute drive from Cox's Bazar, and in front of me are hundreds of women, all in brightly-coloured saris. They look slightly incongruous against their stark surroundings. All are newly arrived Rohingyas. We are inside a makeshift aid distribution centre, which sounds organised and official but is anything but. It is simply a clay square on the side of a paddy field. This is one of the few open spaces that has not been filled up with rickety tarpaulin-covered shelters for the tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees who arrive every day. Waiting with the others I see a woman cradling a young baby. I am told by Zoora Khatun that her daughter Murzia is just two days old; a child of the conflict. She said: ""I was escaping from my village. I had been walking for five days and went into labour. A stranger let me stay in his house to deliver my baby. After she was born I made my way to the camp."" Ms Khatun is clutching a small packet of biscuits. She tells me that is all she has been given to eat since she arrived. Baby Murzia has not seen a doctor since she was born; her mother says she was turned away from a medical centre because it was too busy. Suddenly, a fight breaks out. Some aid has been thrown into the crowd, sparking a fierce battle between many grabbing hands, all tearing and pulling at the package. This is what starvation does. In the melee we see Shakin, an elderly woman. Her frail frame is being tossed and buffeted by the fighting crowd. Her grandson does his best to protect her but even he is finding it difficult to stay upright. All hell is breaking loose. I learn Shakin is 80 years old. She is exhausted by her long, difficult journey across the border from Myanmar into Bangladesh. I can hardly hear her; her voice is more like a deep gasp for air. She manages to tell me she saw her nephew killed and her home torched. More than 300,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks. That's 300,000 destitute people who need food, water, shelter, clothing and aid. But I have not seen a large-scale international aid presence operating here on the ground. I have a seen a Medecins Sans Frontieres camp. And I have seen the distinctive white 4x4 SUVs with the UN logo emblazoned on the side. The only aid distribution I have seen is thrown from passing trucks. It is much-needed food and clothing collected by well-intentioned locals but it reduces the refugees to begging for scraps and fighting among themselves. It is haphazard and uncontrolled. Only the fittest and strongest will manage to grasp and hold unto what has been jettisoned. Some volunteers are trying to be more organised. Muhammad Kapiluddin and his friends are all young professional Bangladeshis who have banded together to bring donations to makeshift camps. The packets they hand out contain paracetamol, puffed rice and other dried foods. ""I haven't seen any international NGOs here. They need to come quickly,"" he said. ""I don't know why they are not here. These people need help."" The plight of the Rohingya refugees might worsen. Tens of thousands more inside Myanmar are said to be on the move, making their way here to Bangladesh. That means more hungry mouths to feed - and nobody to feed them."

Around 5.7 million homes and businesses in the state are without power. More than 120 homes near Orlando have had to be evacuated from rising floodwaters. Irma has now weakened to a tropical storm as it heads towards southern Georgia, and forecasts also suggest that South Carolina and Alabama are in its path. Sustained winds of 130mph were reported when the storm first made landfall in the Florida Keys on Sunday, but by Monday had dropped to around 85mph. Irma's eye is moving up the coast and earlier made landfall for a second time at Marco Island before heading towards Naples, one of America's wealthiest cities. Meteorologist Steve Hamilton said flash flooding could become a problem as the storm moved north and heavy rains fell on mountainous area, and that the extreme conditions would continue for a few more days. ""The storm surge occurs in what we tend to call the dirty side of the storm,"" he said. ""The wind literally pushes the water up against the shoreline . That is a storm surge, basically like a wall of water, like a pancake of water."" :: Live updates: Hurricane Irma There are fears storm surges of 3m to 4.5m (10ft to 15ft) could engulf houses in low-lying coastal areas and cause devastating flooding. A tweet from the National Hurricane Centre read: ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Areas of southeastern Florida, including Miami, have already suffered flooding. Rainfall of two to four inches (5-10cm) an hour was reported as the storm brought down two cranes. Streets were also flooded in the city's financial district. :: Florida residents: 'We pray we make it through' Police said a man in the Florida Keys was killed in a truck crash. Monroe County Sheriff's Office said his body was discovered by first responders who were patrolling during lulls in the bad weather on Saturday afternoon. Another two people, both law enforcement officials, died in a head-on crash in Hardee County. Meanwhile, a woman in Miami had no choice but to deliver her own baby - with medical personnel coaching her on the phone because the emergency services were unable to reach her. :: How are hurricanes categorised? The National Weather Service (NWS) said alerts for tornadoes were in place across southern Florida until midnight on Monday (5am UK time). Locals were warned that ""fast-moving tornadoes can develop with little warning in hurricane rain bands"". The NWS has urged those exposed to Irma to stay indoors, hunker down away from windows, and to use ""whatever you have to try and protect yourself from flying debris"". President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in Florida, which will allow emergency funds to pour into the state. Speaking at his Camp David presidential retreat, Mr Trump said: ""The bad news is this is some big monster, but I think we're very well coordinated. #Irma winds will push deadly storm surge into the western Florida coastline, 10-15ft deep in some locations! https://t.co/8LpU6pkNdf pic.twitter.com/Ymc0Fi1yo3 ""I hope there aren't too many people in the path.

Take this deadly storm seriously. Stay safe, be prepared, listen to local evacuation advisories."" For those trying to flee and seek refuge inland, the changing forecast has caused concern. ""Not only did we go west, but so did Irma. She's tracking us, that feisty minx,"" said Chris Cardona, who has fled his mobile home near Miami with his wife Laurie.

2017-09-11,Badger culling has been given the go-ahead in 11 new areas across England as part of an effort to prevent the spread of tuberculosis in cattle. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/badger-culling-extended-to-stop-spread-of-tuberculosis-in-cattle-11030610,"New licenses for the controversial practice were announced in parts of Devon, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and Cheshire, and pilots will be extended in Gloucestershire and Somerset. Opponents say killing the creatures is inhumane and ineffective, but the Government insists it is necessary to tackle the spread of tuberculosis and eventually eradicate the disease. The bacteria lives in the lymph nodes of cattle and can be spread to humans - but in the UK, its spread is generally prevented through the pasteurisation of dairy products. Because badgers spread the bacteria, those in favour of culling argue that killing them stops more cows catching the disease. But it's not clear quite how effective a cull might be. While past research has shown that trapping and shooting badgers can reduce infections by 16%, other studies have proved inconclusive. As well as culling badgers, the Government is also embarking on a vaccination programme and launching an advisory scheme for farmers in areas where there is a significant risk of the disease. Chief vet Nigel Gibbens said: ""Proactive badger control is currently the best available option and the licensing of further areas is necessary to realise disease-control benefits across the high risk area of England, rather than at local levels."" Farming minister George Eustice said the Government had a ""clear plan"" to eradicate the disease over the next 20 years. He added: ""Bovine TB not only has a devastating impact on our beef and dairy farms, but causes harm and distress to infected cattle. ""Vaccination is just one part of our comprehensive strategy, which also includes tighter cattle controls, improved biosecurity and badger control in areas where bovine TB is rife, to tackle the reservoir of disease in wildlife. ""While our eventual aim is to eradicate the disease completely, farmers are facing the reality of bovine TB on their farms every day."" A total of 21 areas in the England will see culls carried out this year."
2017-09-11,A Christian couple who removed their six-year-old son from school after another boy started wearing a dress have told Sky News they took action because their child's health was beginning to suffer. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/boy-taken-out-of-school-after-another-boy-wears-a-dress-11030747,"Sally and Nigel Rowe, from the Isle of Wight, say their son returned ""totally drained"" from lessons one day. They feel the issue should have been kept out of the classroom, and are considering legal action. The couple took a keen interest in the Church of England primary school concerned, helping to run assemblies, but were taken aback when their son expressed concern. Mr Rowe, 44, said: ""When he got home from school one day, he said: 'Daddy I'm confused. There's a boy in my class who says he's now a boy but then sometimes he's a girl.' ""I was concerned by that."" Mrs Rowe, 42, said it appeared to have happened without warning. ""We felt it was just done,"" she said. ""One day, boy, next day, girl, no consultation."" They removed their son a few months later because he was ""becoming increasingly unhappy at school, to the point where he was under stress"". Mrs Rowe said her child would say he did not want to go to school because he felt sick, while during holidays he would ask how many days were left before term began again. One day, he came home from classes ""totally drained"". The mother added: ""He couldn't even do his favourite activity of skateboarding after school because he was too tired. ""He kept on getting ill, but when he was ill it seemed like a relief he was out of that environment."" They also felt the boy who was wearing a dress was not being properly supported. Mrs Rowe said: ""Instead of just shoving it into the public domain in a school where other children are affected as well, we felt that it should have been done privately. ""And we felt that actually they did a disservice to the family in that respect - that he should have got that support."" Mrs Rowe said the school told them it had little room to manoeuvre: ""We talked to the head, we talked to the teacher concerned and they basically said: 'We have no choice, we have to accept this, otherwise I could even lose my job.'"" The couple feel they are being discriminated against for holding Christian values. ""We're not being listened to. We think it's about child protection and protecting all children,"" she added. Mr Rowe has said the issue ""needs to go to government"" as a six-year-old child is ""not old enough to make those decisions"". The couple have taken advice from the Christian Legal Centre. A spokesman from the Diocese of Portsmouth told The Sunday Times: ""Our schools are inclusive, safe spaces where pupils learn to respect diversity of all kinds. ""We comply with the legal requirements of the Equality Act 2010 and believe that all should feel welcomed, valued and nurtured as part of a learning community."""
2017-09-11,The NHS will try to cut £300m from its annual pharmaceuticals bill by using cheaper alternatives to the most expensive drugs. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-plans-to-use-cheaper-drugs-to-save-300m-and-fund-innovation-11031416,"Rules governing the use of biosimilars - cheaper versions of existing biological treatments - will be announced by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens. It is among a package of measures intended to divert funding to new innovations. Currently six of the 10 most expensive drugs in the UK are biological medicines, those derived or synthesised from biological material such as viruses, and therefore the most complex to develop and the most costly. Speaking at the NHS Expo conference in Manchester, Mr Stevens will also say some new new treatments will be routinely available for the first time. They include new oral treatments for Hepatitis C that could save £50m and a new treatment that helps restore sight using patients' own teeth. The NHS spends over £15bn on drugs every year and is attempting to bring costs down. Measures already announced include rationing access to new medicines likely to cost more than £20m, a move that is facing a High Court challenge from the pharmaceutical industry. The NHS is already consulting on ending free prescriptions for medicines with low clinical effectiveness. Mr Stevens, will tell delegates the new rules will enable the NHS to focus on innovation. ""The NHS has a proud history of innovation. As our 70th anniversary approaches it is important that we do not just celebrate these often unsung achievements, but also unleash the full potential of innovation in treatment and commissioning to ensure we deliver high quality healthcare for future generations."" One of the new treatments that will receive a £700,000 investment is auditory brainstem implants, which can help restore the sensation of hearing to some children born with profound deafness. The operation is performed by Central Manchester University Hospitals and involves inserting a device directly against the brainstem, bypassing the cochlea and auditory nerve and could help around nine children a year. The expo will also hear from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who will say NHS trusts must give patients access to their medical records and the ability to make GP appointments on a single smartphone app by the end of next year."
2017-09-11,"Immigration, so central to the debate about Britain's place in the EU over the past decades, has been the elephant in the room since the referendum.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/post-brexit-immigration-the-thorniest-issue-of-all-11022896,"As the single market, customs unions and ""control"" of various aspects of policy have been slowly becoming clear, detail on what ministers are actually planning as an alternative to free movement has been scant. Until now. The detailed 82-page paper leaked by The Guardian may only be a draft - peppered with references to the need to consult - but it is the first, tantalising indication of Government thinking, and it is far from business as usual. Theresa May has been clear since she took office that she wants the migration numbers to come down and believes that is what people voted for. Despite the weakness of her leadership, I'm told she has been ""immovable"" on this point in Cabinet discussions. :: Long read: The unpredictable three months ahead The proposals are that low-skilled migrants would get a maximum two years' of residency in Britain and high-skilled, from doctors to bankers and nuclear scientists, up to five years when free movement ends. The priorities are set out as making ""existing residents better off"" and forcing businesses to give jobs to ""resident labour"" from Britain, rather than adding points to our GDP. For big employers, this is the ""cliff edge"" many had feared. And not only big firms, but employers like the NHS, which has 10% of its doctors and 4% of nurses from the EU. The aim of paying higher wages to British workers was not supposed to mean a higher agency fee bill for the cash-strapped health service. The construction, social care, agriculture and hospitality sectors each rely on more than 100,000 migrants to meet their requirements - what the Prime Minister says is a sustainable level for net migration across the board. Who leaked it and to what end? The Home Office is already looking internally at who had access to it, but the draft was also circulated to other relevant departments including the Treasury and Department for Exiting the EU. The leak to the Guardian, a newspaper hostile to the Government's immigration policies, may provide clues. But the leak itself could be played to Mrs May's advantage. There is no estimate in there of the impact of the proposed policies, it is all about ""control"". As one Government insider put it to me: ""Whether it ends up being - 100,000 or 150,000 - the public want to see that the Government have a handle on it and is making the decisions."" Anyway, the net migration figures may not drop by anything like that much. Strict restrictions on income and work already apply to migrants from outside the EU, from which net migration was running at 266,000 in the six months to May; in an area the Government can already control. Is it damaging? Labour's official reaction has been noticeably muted, although pro-European backbenchers have branded the proposals ""mean and cynical"" and there has been anger from London mayor Sadiq Khan, as well as from Nicola Sturgeon. In a statement, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott simply said the party would wait for the Government's official proposals, expected in a white paper in the coming weeks and then published in an immigration bill early next year. While the Labour Party is still divided on its own approach to immigration, it's not very easy to throw stones. Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, has given the PM staunch support this morning. Instead of refusing to comment on the leak, he tacitly endorsed the approach saying people voted for control of migration, and that ministers would need to strike a balance. How these proposals will be received by our negotiating partners in Brussels, how to upskill Britain's population and how this approach fits into the Government's plans to turbo-charge building of homes and infrastructure are yet to be hammered out. And with no Conservative majority in Parliament, the Prime Minister must wait and see how much dissent there is in her party. But the thorniest issue of all - immigration - could not wait forever."
2017-09-11,The cost of new offshore wind power is set to fall by 50% over the next five years following the award of new government contracts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/offshore-wind-cheaper-than-new-nuclear-power-for-the-first-time-11030328,"The results of the latest auction for new projects were cheered by environmental campaigners as the contracts - which guarantee a set price for power - tumbled to record lows. The cost fell to £74.75 per megawatt hour (MWh) for projects delivered in 2021/22 and £57.50 for projects in 2022/23. That compares with £92.50 MWh for the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station - due to start generating electricity in the latter half of the 2020s. :: Hinkley Point C hit by £1.5 over-run and delay The results of the auction for 11 new contracts, which also included biomass and waste plant energy schemes, should help put downward pressure on household bills in the years ahead. The reductions were put down to lower costs across the renewable energy sector as it continues to grow. Factors included the downturn in the oil and gas sector, the availability of larger turbines and a more competitive supply chain. The Government said the new UK-wide projects - the biggest of which Dong Energy's Hornsea Project Two off the Yorkshire coast - would create thousands of jobs and provide enough power for 3.6 million homes. Ahead of the publication of its Clean Growth Plan, energy and industry minister Richard Harrington said: ""We've placed clean growth at the heart of the Industrial Strategy to unlock opportunities across the country, while cutting carbon emissions."" Lawrence Slade, chief executive of energy industry body Energy UK, called on ministers to build on the UK's lead in renewables. He said: ""This (auction) shows what can be achieved by providing the necessary certainty for investment, which drives down the cost of decarbonisation, benefits customers and the wider economy, and creates highly skilled jobs and stimulates growth in rural economies."" Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green Party, said the figures achieved should be the ""nail in the coffin"" for new nuclear. She said: ""While clean, green wind power has the potential to seriously cut people's bills, the Government's undying commitment to new nuclear risks locking us into sky-high prices for years to come. ""The Government should now commit to this technology - and scale up investment in offshore wind so that it becomes the backbone of British energy."" The nuclear sector argues that offshore wind is one part of solving the UK's energy challenge through a low carbon future. It points out atomic power is more reliable, despite higher costs."

Theresa May has said the attempt to transpose thousands of EU laws and regulations into British law is vital to avoid a legal ""cliff edge"" when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Jeremy Corbyn had ordered his MPs to vote against the bill, saying the fact that ministers would be able to change the legislation without scrutiny from Parliament was a ""power grab"". However the bill was passed by 326 votes to 290 - with seven Labour MPs voting with the Government after more than 13 hours of debate. :: As it happened: Brexit bill debate Mrs May was reliant on all her MPs falling into line, given the lack of a Conservative majority - and managed to secure their support at this stage. But a number of Tory MPs voiced concerns about the legislation during the debate and said they would need concessions to be made before they would vote it through at the next stage, scheduled for October. In a statement following the vote, the PM said: ""Earlier this morning Parliament took a historic decision to back the will of the British people and vote for a bill which gives certainty and clarity ahead of our withdrawal from the European Union. ""Although there is more to do, this decision means we can move on with negotiations with solid foundations and we continue to encourage MPs from all parts of the UK to work together in support of this vital piece of legislation."" In a day of heated exchanges, Labour MP Chris Bryant claimed the bill was ""pernicious and dangerous"" and something that ""Erdogan, Madura and Putin would be proud of"". Conservative MPs who voiced concerns included Bob Neill, chair of the Commons' Justice Committee, who said the powers being granted to the Government went beyond what is ""acceptable or necessary"". Former chancellor Ken Clarke warned his party colleagues that ""sweeping"" powers could be abused by a future Labour government to amend legislation. And Dr Sarah Wollaston said she would support her party, but only in the ""expectation that they will support sensible amendments"" down the line. The Labour leader faced his own rebellion as several of his MPs defied his order to oppose the bill and vote for a Labour amendment instead. The amendment was defeated by 318 votes to 296, although it secured support from SNP and Lib Dem MPs. Former Europe minister Caroline Flint, whose Don Valley constituency voted heavily for Leave, said Labour risked appearing to want to ""thwart the result of the EU referendum"". She was heckled by Labour remainers after the vote. Frank Field, a Leave-supporting Labour MP hit out at his own colleagues, calling them ""wolves in sheep's clothing"" for opposing the bill. Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, called the vote a ""deeply disappointing result"" which ""leaves rights unprotected, it silences Parliament on key decisions and undermines the devolution settlement"". Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, said it was a ""dark day for the for the mother of parliaments. The Liberal Democrats will fight to amend the bill in Committee to stop this affront to democracy""."
2017-09-11,Arms manufacturers will gather in London this week to grease palms and prepare sales of controversial defence and security equipment.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/whats-on-show-at-controversial-arms-fair-11030372,"More than 1,600 exhibitors from 54 countries are attending the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) at ExCeL. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon and Liam Fox, Secretary of State for International Trade, will speak at the event alongside the chiefs of staff of the UK's armed forces. In 2015/16, the Ministry of Defence spent nearly £19bn, accounting for over 40% of all UK government procurement spend and representing the fifth largest defence budget in the world. Here is what will be on show. :: Surveillance technology Among the controversial companies keen to grab a slice of that very large pie is surveillance business Dataminr, which is 5% owned by Twitter. With exclusive access to Twitter's entire real-time stream of public tweets, Dataminr was used by US intelligence agencies until the social media company banned them from the service. Reports claimed that the British government expressed frustration at the decision to turn away government customers, noting the same data was available to private companies. Dataminr had previously produced a brochure advertising how the company could use geospatial analytics to monitor a student protest in South Africa by tracking key words and hashtags. :: Drones The four largest UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) vendors are all in attendance at DSEI, including General Atomics, which develops the Predator and Reaper line of drones used by the UK military. Unmanned aerial vehicles are an increasingly popular part of military hardware, whether conducting surveillance or delivering ordnance. Drone strikes are growing increasingly controversial, despite the enormous safety advantages that the technology offers to pilots. The UK has equipped its drones with Hellfire missiles and GBU-12 Paveway laser-guided bombs, which have been used to destroy Islamic State weapons and kill personnel in Iraq and Syria. Manufacturers of the Hellfire missiles will be in attendance, with three of the top four arms-producing companies - Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrup Grumman - having produced versions of the weapon. MPs have called for the Government to clarify its position on drone strikes being used in targeted killings. :: Hardware Eight aerial vehicles, including a Chinook and a Blackhawk, will be on static display at the event, alongside nine displays of land vehicles and systems and six marine defence platforms and prototypes. There will also be seven warships visiting the fair; five from the Royal Navy, including HMS Argyll. The two foreign vessels are the Belgian navy ops vessel, BNS Pollux, and the Irish Naval Service vessel, LE Samuel Beckett, which was accompanied up the Thames yesterday by the Met police. Welcome to the LÉ Samuel Beckett, an offshore patrol vessel from the Irish Naval Service being escorted in by Marine 3 pic.twitter.com/hSDB0vWbxM :: Other tech on display Companies are showing off other novel devices and technologies that they hope will attract a portion of the UK's sizeable defence budget. One firm is offering military units tiny drones that can be carried in soldiers' pockets and deployed to help them see around corners or other obstructions without exposing themselves to gunfire. Others are selling devices for monitoring soldiers' thermoregulatory and cardiovascular responses to the challenges of the battlefield or the training centre. One company that had made small and low-cost encrypted radio devices for the recreational market will be attempting to sell them to the defence sector. Another project supported by the Dutch Military Police is offering a netgun which can be used to take illegally operated quadcopter drones from the air."

The online-only expansion could come under its 'Marcus' brand - named after bank founder Marcus Goldman - which launched in the US last year. Stephen Scherr, the bank's head of strategy, told the FT: ""Much like in the US, we're aiming to offer consumers easy-to-use and higher-returning savings options than (they) might have elsewhere."" 'Marcus' marked a shift away from its traditional focus on investment banking and wealth management. The bank has been looking to diversify its income streams following a tough time for its trading division - with its latest second-quarter results showing profits being held back by a 17% fall in trading revenue. The Press Association says Goldman has already held discussions with UK regulators and is in the process of planning staffing arrangements, including the opening of a call centre in London. The development is likely to boost competition following a torrid time for savers since the financial crisis, with interest rates at record lows. Many financial markets and economists do not foresee the Bank of England raising rates until next year - a potential factor behind Goldman's timing. It is also a rare piece of good news for The City as a host of banks and other financial services firms mull opening or expanding operations in the EU to maintain access to the single market after Brexit. Goldman is already planning to move some client-facing roles to Madrid, Milan and Frankfurt."
2017-09-11,"The £1bn investment Theresa May promised Northern Ireland in return for support from the DUP will need to be approved by Parliament, the Treasury has confirmed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170912015309/http://news.sky.com/story/torys-1bn-deal-with-dup-will-need-parliament-approval-11030655,"The acknowledgement that MPs will need to authorise the payment, which enabled the Prime Minister to cobble together a fragile parliamentary majority, has emerged as a result of a legal challenge to the Tory-DUP deal. The so-called confidence-and-supply arrangement, signed in June, pledged £1bn more funding for hospitals, schools and infrastructure in return for support from the DUP's 10 MPs on key votes such as the second reading of the EU Withdrawal Bill later today. But after a letter threatening legal action was sent to Government lawyers by anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller and the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), a Treasury solicitor confirmed the pledged investment ""will have appropriate Parliamentary authorisation"". According to the Press Association, the letter went on to state that no timetable had yet been decided for making the payments. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""All UK government spending needs parliamentary authorisation, generally via the Estimates and Supplementary Estimated process. ""Our focus in Northern Ireland is in restoring power-sharing."" The letter sent by Ms Miller and the IWGB challenged the Government on two fronts. The first was questioning the legal basis of using either prerogative powers or secondary legislation to make the payment. The second was to suggest any payment would contravene the Equalities Act, if it was not first subject to a public sector assessment to establish whether it unfairly discriminated against other regions of the UK. In separate proceedings, the deal is also being challenged by Green Party activist Ciaran McClean, who announced in July he intended to crowd-fund an attempt to argue the deal contravened both the Bribery Act and the Good Friday Agreement. Ms Miller, who previously mounted a successful challenge to force the Government to give Parliament the final say on formally beginning the Brexit process by triggering Article 50, has said the latest response ""beggars belief"". ""Neither at the time the Government sealed its dubious deal with the DUP in exchange for their votes in the Commons, nor at any point since, has the Government made it clear that the £1bn of taxpayers' money for Northern Ireland could only be handed over following Parliamentary approval. ""We all need to know when the Government intended to come clean to Parliament, its parliamentary party, and the public. When was parliamentary time going to be found to authorise this payment? And did the DUP know the cheque the Government promised to pay might bounce? ""On the day the Government is asking MPs to grant it sweeping new powers, and in the week it is trying to pack parliamentary scrutiny committees to blatantly change the rules in their favour, MPs are entitled to wonder what else the Government may have 'forgotten' to tell them."" IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said: ""There's undoubtedly a need for increased social spending throughout the UK but this should be on a basis of fairness, not self-serving party politics."" Peter Dowd MP, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the treasury, said the acknowledgement that parliamentary approval would be required for the payment to be lawful was a ""a clear indication that the Conservatives' chaotic attempts to circumvent Parliament must come to an end"". He added: ""(Philip) Hammond must come clean about whether he intends to increase taxes, slash spending, or increase borrowing to fund the black hole created by the £1bn DUP bribe and the £2bn u-turn on his attempt to increase national insurance contributions for self-employed workers."""

As a young teenager, at first I just assumed this was normal - I'd always struggled with my periods. How was I to know this wasn't just part of being a teenage girl? But the bleeding kept happening between my periods. And it was bad. I was experiencing pain like I'd never felt before and it was debilitating. Again and again I went to the doctors, but they misdiagnosed me several times. They told me I was pregnant and that I was experiencing a miscarriage. They told me that I had an STI. It wasn't until I was in college, and my symptoms were so bad that I was bleeding every day, that I finally got an answer. I was then aged 18. They sent me to a specialist, who diagnosed me with endometriosis following an operation. But things were still the same after they operated. The pain eased slightly, but prolonged bleeding and sharp pain all down my right side remained an everyday occurrence. I bled constantly for four months after my operation and ended up in A&E. A later scan revealed the cysts; one was six inches and they sat on my ovary. The doctors suspected cancer so they decided to operate again and remove both cysts. I only started noticing a real difference after my second operation. While I still got constant pain, my periods regulated and were a lot lighter thanks to the hormonal coil they had inserted during my first operation. Since then I've had a couple of trips to A&E for pain relief during particularly difficult times in my cycle, which are excruciating. I'm still learning to live with the pain on a day-to-day basis. As endometriosis is an incurable and lifelong illness, it's likely that I may be facing more surgeries and complications as I grow up. But to help me cope, I've now joined several support groups for ""endo"" sufferers and I like to get involved with other people like me via social media."

Four unions tabled motions to this week's Trades Union Congress in Brighton calling for some kind of nationally coordinated action, which were then included in a composite motion. The composite motion, among other measures, called for ""immediate steps to develop a coordinated strategy of opposition to the pay cap... including... pay demands, campaign activities, tactics, ballots and industrial action"". The motion was passed unanimously. The leader of one of the unions, the Public and Commercial Services union's Mark Serwotka, made a passionate plea for action. Mr Serwotka said PCS members had endured a 10% pay cut because of the cap, one that will rise to 20% by 2020 if it is not lifted. He called on the TUC to coordinate collective action and campaigns, including industrial action, to end public sector pay restraint across the UK. He said: ""Let's take united action to put money into our members' pockets and to defeat this weak Tory government. ""There is a crisis in public sector pay and now is the time for action. ""Wouldn't it be great if we could have coordinated ballots in the run-up to the Budget."" Ian Murray, of the Fire Brigades Union, said: ""We all know that a Tory government will give working people nothing without a fight. Now is the time to get better organised and get all of our members the pay rise they deserve."" David Baker, of the Educational Institute of Scotland, said public sector workers should ""show this government our collective strength"". Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ""We must commit to marching, demonstrating and lobbying - not just in Westminster, but in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh too. :: Pay cap: Theresa May seems to have found 'magic money tree' ""We need public events in every major city and town across the country to change the face of politics and hold Conservative MPs to account in their own backyards, and joint ballots for industrial action if all else fails.""

A national rally will be held in Westminster in October and the TUC is planning a meeting with the Chancellor. Sky News understands that unions could ballot members over strike action later this year if if their demands for a 5% pay increase are not met. The University and College Union announced on Monday that its members in further education will be consulted on industrial action. On Sunday, Labour refused to rule out supporting nationally coordinated action over the public sector pay cap. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The pay cap must now be lifted across the whole public sector rather than by playing one group of workers off against another."""

The pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, said it had not called the action - adding it was surprised that 200 pilots had failed to report for duty. Air Berlin, which is Germany's second-largest carrier, said most of those off work were plane captains. It has been in financial trouble for years, and industrial relations are at breaking point. In an internal memo to staff, seen by the Reuters news agency, chief operations officer Oliver Iffert wrote: ""No company could possibly be seen in a worse light than Air Berlin today. ""We must return to stable operations. That is crucial in order to bring talks with investors to a successful conclusion."" Air Berlin filed for insolvency after a major shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad, refused to extend its cash lifeline. The subsequent €150m (£135m) loan from the authorities allows Air Berlin to continue flying for three months as rivals circle above - hunting an opportunity to capitalise ahead of a Friday deadline for bids. Ryanair is expected to be in the mix. It has accused the German government of wanting the country's biggest carrier, Lufthansa, to take control of Air Berlin's viable operations. German media has reported Lufthansa wants to take up to half its 140 planes and 3,000 crew for its Eurowings budget airline. Eurowings currently leases 38 aircraft from Air Berlin - and because of this, it too has had to cancel flights because of the pilots' walkout."

It attributed the increase to the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum which has forced up prices for imported goods - costs which are evidently being passed on to shoppers at a time they can least afford them. Mike Prestwood, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Clothing prices rising faster than last year, along with a hike in the cost of petrol, helped nudge inflation upwards. ""Conversely, these effects were partially offset by airfares, which rose more slowly than during last year's summer holidays."" :: Ian King - Will inflation rise see interest rates go up? The headline inflation figure of 2.9% represented an increase from 2.6% in the previous month and was higher than most forecasters had predicted. The data helped sterling to its highest level against the dollar for almost a year - trading at $1.3267 - while it also surged against the euro. The strengthening of the pound can be explained by greater market expectations of an interest rate rise to tackle higher inflation. A number of policymakers at the Bank of England have declared concerns in recent months about the impact of rising prices on the economy. The Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) is due to make its latest decision on rates following a meeting on Thursday. Members will also have taken note of separate figures from the ONS about factory gate costs, which give a future indicator of inflation. They showed an annual rate of 3.4% - their first increase since February - while prices paid by factories for materials and energy were up 7.4%. Commenting on the figures, Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""The inflation data builds a stronger case for the Bank of England to look at hiking rates but it is not yet strong enough for the MPC to act this week. ""Andy Haldane may now choose to vote for a hike, suggesting a 6-3 split on the MPC is now more likely than before with confirmed hawks Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders likely to vote for a hike."" There was political reaction too. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The cost of living squeeze continues, with rising inflation outpacing wages. ""The Government needs to get a grip and get pay rising across the economy. A good start would be to scrap the pay cap for all public sector workers. ""Our dedicated public servants are a team. A pick and mix approach, that rewards some and not others, would be cynical and plain unfair."""

2017-09-12,"This iPhone launch feels a bit muddled, a bit leaky, a bit, well, unApple.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170913020219/http://news.sky.com/story/why-this-is-the-most-unapple-iphone-launch-ever-11031808,"Some think that spells the end of its dominance - but it could ensure its survival. Alongside the next iteration of the iPhone, the iPhone 8 (because this is the eighth generation), we're getting an iPhone X to mark 10 years of the smartphone. We've abandoned 'nine', apparently, and with it the neat logic that had named iPhones to date. Other handset makers like Samsung offered a charcuterie of devices with different names; Apple was, until now, always cleaner. Even worse, we were told pretty much everything about the iPhone X ahead of launch thanks to internal leaks - galling for one of the most instinctively secretive technology companies around. Then there's the phone itself. It's got facial recognition, a very big screen and perhaps wireless charging. And animated emojis. Features that have been seen elsewhere, thrown at a wall in a Cupertino meeting room and packaged into a glass slab that it is rumoured will cost you more than $1000 (£753). Thus the lament: where's the innovation? Where is the single-minded focus and discipline that characterised Apple under Steve Jobs? Jobs was the visionary who gave people something they didn't know they wanted - a supercomputer in their pocket. He was often compared to Henry Ford and he encouraged the comparison. Ford was supposed to have said: ""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."" Jobs' version was this: ""It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."" Steve Jobs was a lot more like Henry Ford than Tim Cook is. But that's a good thing for Apple now. Ford was hugely innovative and hugely successful as a result. In 1908, Ford Motor Company made 10,000 Model T cars. Ten years later, it was nearly a million (Ford didn't call it a Model X, though). At that point, though, Ford started losing ground. Its focus on the assembly-line and mass manufacture 'froze' its automobile design, according to Patrick Vlaskovits, the author of The Lean Entrepreneur. General Motors, under CEO Alfred Sloan, took a different approach, offering lots of different models. Their phrase was ""a car for every purse and purpose"" - rather different from Ford's ""any colour, so long as it's black"". Ford went from selling 2/3 of all US-built cars in 1921 to just 15% in 1927. We're at a similar inflection point for smartphones. Jobs created the mass-smartphone market, as Ford did for cars. But technological improvements 10 years on are merely incremental. People are holding onto phones longer as a result. With the X, Apple will offer eight phones in three different form factors (the X, the 7 and 6s if they keep it, and the SE). $1000 is expensive but people will certainly pay (and why shouldn't they - how many other possessions do you use every hour of every day?). That's a phone for every purse and purpose. Tim Cook is more like Alfred Sloan, and so Apple is becoming more like GM. Managing the transition is undoubtedly tricky but it will mean a new era of dominance for Apple. Maybe even another 10 years."

The FA wrote to FIFA to explain its concerns regarding cybersecurity after its own correspondence with the international association was leaked by Fancy Bear. It also warned the association regarding the activities of the group, and is understood to be considering what the best options are for securing the England team's communications if they get to Russia. FIFA has said that it is relying on third-party support for its own computer security and as such does not itself pass on advice to others. Hackers linked with Russia's military intelligence agency - although Moscow denies they are affiliated - have allegedly targeted sporting associations in operations intended to discredit critics of Russia's involvement in athletics doping. The group, known colloquially as Fancy Bear - or in the more academic language of security research reports as Advanced Persistent Threat 28 - was previously investigated by the FA after it stole and released information on anti-doping in football. Fancy Bear was earlier this year accused of conducting a cyber-espionage campaign targeting high-profile figures at high-class hotels across Europe.

A source told us the man was Jose Manuel Costas Estevez, a building contractor who fled Spain after a fraud conviction. We passed the information to Spanish detectives and they have now confirmed the man is Estevez, 50, who they have been hunting for more than a year. He faces six years in jail for ripping off government departments in Vigo, northwest Spain, by submitting false invoices up to €11m (£9.9m). Former Metropolitan Police border control officer Chris Hobbs said the absence of border controls in most of Europe was allowing the two fugitives to travel freely without fear of capture. He said: ""If you've got no borders you've got a huge playground, the whole of Europe in which to operate in, work in and hide in. And obviously you can't expect local police to know everybody who is wanted in Europe. ""So they will know the odds of them actually being detected anywhere in Europe are pretty remote. ""I think the nature of their offences suggests they are confident, as they have obviously been confidently conning people out of huge sums of money. They know the odds are stacked against them being recognised."" Acklom has been on the Crimestoppers Most Wanted list for nearly a year, accused of fleecing a woman of her £850,000 life savings. He met his alleged victim Carolyn Woods, 57, in a clothes shop she was running in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, in 2012. She said he told her he was millionaire Swiss banker and MI6 agent and that after they fell in love, he promised to marry her. He allegedly persuaded her to lend him all her savings to ease his ""cash-flow"" problems, before fleeing with the money. It's not known if Acklom and Estevez knew each other before they went on the run last year. They were snapped by someone who claimed to be a victim of Acklom and recognised him as he walked past the cafe near Lake Geneva. At the time British detectives believed Acklom was in Spain, where he had been running a property company. It is believed the two men were aware the photograph was being taken and appeared to be trying to hide their faces. Swiss police mounted a surveillance operation after liaising with the UK's National Crime Agency, but the fugitives did not reappear. Chris Hobbs said: ""What are they up to? What are they plotting? Who are they looking to scam in their next operation? ""Because at the end of the day they are moving around Europe, probably living quite a nice lifestyle and they will need funds. ""The only way they are going to get caught is if they have an accident and end up in hospital, or get arrested for something else. But even that depends on them using their own documents and not false papers."" Spanish police believe Estevez has left Geneva and is in another country, while Acklom's whereabouts is not known to Avon and Somerset Police, which is investigating him with a European Arrest Warrant. A force spokesman said: ""Our search for Mark Acklom continues and, as always, anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to call police as soon as possible."""

It was there one night in 1991 that he was picked up by members of the Rooney family who promised him work and somewhere to live. :: Lincolnshire family members sentenced in modern slavery case ""I bit their hand off,"" he said. ""I was just begging then, I'd fallen out of the army, my life was a mess and what they were promising me was an opportunity - I just wanted (to get) off the streets."" For the next year he laboured for the family business laying driveways, his wages were often withheld. He was made to hand over his benefits and forced to live in an outdoor toilet building throughout winter. Mr Smith told Sky News: ""They made me live in this cold brick toilet on their site in Washingborough just outside Lincoln, there was no choice like."" ""Bridget (the mother) controlled what we ate. I always depended on them for food - they had us trapped."" It was during a driveway job in Folkestone in Kent the following year that Mr Smith was set upon once again by members of the family. ""They beat the s*** out of me, I had to lift my lip off my tooth because the tooth had gone through it when they hit me. ""I just thought I've had enough. ""It was 2am. Everyone was asleep and I just slipped out of a caravan and hitchhiked north, I was terrified they'd find me so I only hitchhiked at night and eventually got back up home to the Northeast."" Mr Smith was unaware of the investigation into the Rooney family that led to nine of them being jailed on Tuesday in Nottingham. It was only when he saw the coverage of the trial that he realised it was the same family and that a new generation of the travellers had continued the abuse he had suffered in the 90s. Lincolnshire police worked with 18 further victims who they described as modern day slaves - many of their stories mirror Rod Smith's account back in 1991/92. ""I never spoke out to anybody ... I regret it and I regret earning them so much money because that land that they now have, I was the person that earned them the money to buy that land. ""So all those people that have suffered that is partly down to me."" Mr Smith broke down in tears. ""I never spoke out and I should have spoken out years ago and maybe all those people might not have suffered, but I was just so relieved to get away... I just tried to move on."" On hearing that nine family have now been given lengthy custodial sentences, Mr Smith said: ""I'm glad they've been put away, I believe in karma and they deserve punishment but prison isn't enough for them - they have got meals and a nice warm bed, it's more that what I had."" ""I have moved on but still don't have many friends because I don't trust people now."""

It is among a package of measures intended to divert funding to new innovations. Currently six of the 10 most expensive drugs in the UK are biological medicines, those derived or synthesised from biological material such as viruses, and therefore the most complex to develop and the most costly. Speaking at the NHS Expo conference in Manchester, Mr Stevens will also say some new new treatments will be routinely available for the first time. They include new oral treatments for Hepatitis C that could save £50m and a new treatment that helps restore sight using patients' own teeth. The NHS spends over £15bn on drugs every year and is attempting to bring costs down. Measures already announced include rationing access to new medicines likely to cost more than £20m, a move that is facing a High Court challenge from the pharmaceutical industry. The NHS is already consulting on ending free prescriptions for medicines with low clinical effectiveness. Mr Stevens, will tell delegates the new rules will enable the NHS to focus on innovation. ""The NHS has a proud history of innovation. As our 70th anniversary approaches it is important that we do not just celebrate these often unsung achievements, but also unleash the full potential of innovation in treatment and commissioning to ensure we deliver high quality healthcare for future generations."" One of the new treatments that will receive a £700,000 investment is auditory brainstem implants, which can help restore the sensation of hearing to some children born with profound deafness. The operation is performed by Central Manchester University Hospitals and involves inserting a device directly against the brainstem, bypassing the cochlea and auditory nerve and could help around nine children a year. The expo will also hear from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who will say NHS trusts must give patients access to their medical records and the ability to make GP appointments on a single smartphone app by the end of next year."

New sanctions following North Korea's most recent nuclear test will hamper its ability to legitimately import gas and oil from China, but the nation retains an ability - and an increasing interest - in generating enormous revenues through cybercrime. Evidence suggests that a North Korean government bureau has been conducting illicit economic activity for quite some time. From 2015 through to 2016, a series of sophisticated cyber heists targeting the SWIFT global financial messaging service allowed a state-sponsored cybercrime collective, which researchers called the Lazarus Group, to steal millions of dollars. Cybersecurity researchers linked the Lazarus Group to North Korea, although it is not known whether it is part of the secretive government bureau Office 39, or a group hired by Pyonyang's elite to fill their own coffers. New research by cybersecurity firm FireEye's Luke McNamara describes North Korea's increasing interest in cryptocurrencies as an asset class, with the value of Bitcoin increasing by 400% since January of this year. Mr McNamara notes how the secretive North Korean agency known informally as Office 39 has been a critical asset of the state by generating black market revenues since at least the 1970s. It is estimated to bring $1bn a year through illicit activities, including counterfeiting US dollar currency, producing narcotics, and even smuggling gold. FireEye's research noted how escalating economic sanctions against North Korea were accompanied by an upsurge in spearphishing campaigns targeting South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. Targeting the exchanges rather than simply the Bitcoin itself offers the attackers an opportunity to anonymise the thefts or withdraw the digital cash for fiat currencies such as the South Korean won, US dollar or Chinese renminbi. ""It should be no surprise that cryptocurrencies, as an emerging asset class, are becoming a target of interest by a regime that operates in many ways like a criminal enterprise,"" said Mr McNamara. ""While at present North Korea is somewhat distinctive in both their willingness to engage in financial crime and their possession of cyber espionage capabilities, the uniqueness of this combination will likely not last long-term as rising cyber powers may see similar potential. ""Cyber criminals may no longer be the only nefarious actors in this space."""

To have marshalled enough parliamentary discipline to avoid any Conservative or DUP rebellion - while also seeing seven Labour MPs join them in the voting lobbies - will be savoured as a victory for Theresa May, not least on a matter as traditionally divisive for her party as Europe. But her acknowledgement on Tuesday morning that ""there is more to do"" is a significant understatement. Numerous Conservative MPs have expressed deep concern about the anti-democratic impact of the bill in its current form, and have made it abundantly clear there is a price to pay for their midnight support. As dawn broke, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also gave signals the Government understood the terms, telling Sky News it was right that Parliament look into the detail of the bill, insisting ministers would be ""listening"". On the Conservative benches, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, former business minister Anna Soubry and former chancellor Ken Clarke were among those who chose not to pull the trigger on a rebellion on Monday night. However, the gun is still loaded and if serious changes are not made as MPs in committees dissect the bill line by line, it may yet be used. Indeed, up to 12 Tory MPs are believed to already be backing amendments tabled for consideration by committee. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has also made clear he intends to make the committee stage of the bill as testing for the Government as possible, despite the divisions within his own party that Monday night's vote exposed. Labour's amendments have already been tabled - focused on watering down the executive powers given to ministers to make law with limited parliamentary scrutiny, securing protections on human rights and environmental standards, and ensuring devolved powers remain devolved. But Sir Keir is also suggesting the bill may be already beyond repair - arguing the Prime Minister should have dropped it and started again, rather than burdening Parliament with the task of mangling the current form into something more acceptable to those who opposed its second reading. ""This is likely to cause delays and division in Parliament, and the Prime Minister has nobody to blame but herself,"" SIr Keir said. However, when it comes to the other opposition parties, it is not just the Government but Labour they hold in contempt. The Liberal Democrats accused Labour rebels of handing the government victory, while Plaid Cymru said Labour's lack of unity risked ""letting the Tories off the hook"". But Labour rebels seem far less likely at another crucial Commons vote due to be held once more in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Government is seeking to grant itself a majority on the selection committee - the body which chooses the make-up of MPs on the standing committees that scrutinise legislation - another step which the opposition parties have labelled a ""power grab"". The controversy lies in the fact that the Conservatives have no outright majority and therefore, critics say, the balance should be equally split between Labour and the Tories. Not so, argue the Government - pointing to the fact they have a majority on the floor of the House with DUP support that will see the motion pass, and therefore a majority on the selection committee is warranted to avoid logjams in the business of legislating. The critical question will be whether any so-called ""constitutionalists"" on the Tory benches, who grudgingly nodded the EU Withdrawal Bill to its next stage, feel this is a step too far."

Michie's agent confirmed the daughter of the 60-year-old, who now stars in Holby City, died at the event in Dorset. The agent said: ""Sadly, I can confirm the tragic death of John Michie's daughter, Louella, at Bestival. ""John and his wife Carol ask that the privacy of their family be respected at this traumatic time."" Police said officers were alerted just before 1am on Monday after concerns were raised about the Ms Michie's welfare. The 25-year-old, from London, had been attending the event at the Lulworth Estate. Following a search, her body was found in a wooded area on the edge of the festival site. A cordon has been set up while forensic examinations are carried out. Police said the suspect, from London, was arrested ""to enable officers to conduct an interview under caution to help establish the full circumstances"". Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Derbyshire said: ""Following the discovery of the woman's body we have now launched an investigation into her death. ""A post-mortem examination will be carried out in due course and this should give us more of an indication as to the cause of death. ""We are working closely with the festival organisers.""

2017-09-12,"Under normal circumstances, today's inflation figures would very likely be the precursor to a rise in interest rates this Thursday.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170913020219/http://news.sky.com/story/will-inflation-rise-see-interest-rates-go-up-11031976,"Whenever the headline rate of inflation strays one percentage point either side of the 2% rate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is mandated to target, the Governor is obliged to write to the Chancellor, explaining why. With the consumer prices index at 2.9% in August, we are moving close to letter-writing territory. The chances are, though, that the MPC will continue to sit on its hands this week. The majority of its members have, during the last year, chosen to 'see through' the recent rise in inflation and treat it as a temporary phenomenon caused by the devaluation in the pound following the vote to leave the EU last year. :: Inflation hits 2.9% as fuel and clothing costs grow Mark Carney, the Governor, has also made clear on a number of occasions his concerns about the impact Brexit is likely to have on the economy. He strongly believes it is going to hit growth for a number of years and this is another reason why he has been so adamant that rates must stay lower for longer. The recent fragility in consumer spending is just one of a number of indicators that suggests the economy is losing momentum. That devaluation in the pound is certainly one of the main causes for the rise in inflation last month. Another, though, is the rally in the oil price which saw crude trading above $50 per barrel for most of August. It is currently back to levels last seen in mid-May. The MPC's expectation is that, towards the end of the year and into 2018, inflation should abate as the impact of the drop in the pound last year is 'lapped' and sterling-related price increases start to drop out of the year-on-year comparison. But there is no doubt that the pressure for an interest-rate rise is starting to build, as can be seen by the rise in the pound today on foreign exchange markets. Sterling has not traded at this level against the US dollar since 13 September last year, before the so-called ""flash crash"" that briefly saw it tumble on Far Eastern markets to $1.145. Against the euro, the best-performing currency among advanced economies this year, sterling's rally has been less spectacular. Ironically, this recovery against the US dollar may go some way towards providing insulation against further price rises, since the greenback is the currency in which most international commodities used by manufacturers are priced. Yet it will also have the effect of blunting the improvement in competitiveness that Britain's exporters have enjoyed as a result of sterling's devaluation. The dog that has not barked in all this is wage inflation. In spite of the jobless rate standing at a 42-year low, which ordinarily would spark a rise in wage inflation, earnings growth has stagnated. Until such time as earnings growth picks up - and perhaps the Government's decision to loosen its 1% cap on public sector pay rises may speed that process up - the MPC is likely to hold off raising the cost of borrowing."

The Birthday Party is among Pinter's most critically acclaimed works, and was his second full-length play. Its return to London will be produced by Sonia Friedman and directed by Ian Rickson, who directed Pinter's last performance as an actor in Krapp's Last Tape. The Birthday Party follows a piano player who lives in a rundown boarding house, facing two sinister strangers who arrive for his birthday. ""I knew Harold from when I ran the Royal Court and he was a great mentor to me,"" Rickson said. ""Doing The Birthday Party is particularly thrilling because, like any first major play, it has the intense DNA of a writer's inner life; their yearnings, their obsessions, their longings,"" he added. ""There's something about The Birthday Party in particular that's so raw and committed - it has this kind of anarchic, punk spirit."" Pinter was born in London in 1930 and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005, the same year he found he suffered from a rare skin disease. He died in 2008 from liver cancer. The play will celebrate its opening night on 18 January 2018 and will run at the Harold Pinter Theatre to 14 April. Tickets will be on sale from midday on Tuesday, with priority booking starting at 9am."
2017-09-12,Center Parcs is weighing a takeover of smaller rival Forest Holidays in a move that would seek to capitalise on growing demand for staycations fuelled by the weak pound.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170913020219/http://news.sky.com/story/center-parcs-resorts-to-takeover-bid-for-rival-forest-holidays-11031870,"Sky News understands that Center Parcs, which operates five resorts across the UK, is among a pack of suitors for Forest Holidays, which has been put up for sale by its private equity owner. A deal would enable Center Parcs and its Canadian owner to accelerate the consolidation of the UK market at a time when demand is expected to grow for domestic holidays from cost-conscious British consumers. The weakness of sterling against the euro, and a series of terrorist attacks on the Continent and elsewhere, have impacted on overseas holiday bookings, according to industry analysis. Forest Holidays is jointly owned by the Forestry Commission and LDC, the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, and trades from nine sites across the UK. The company pays rent to the Forestry Commission based on each cabin it operates. Center Parcs is already pursuing an expansion plan that includes the opening of a resort in Ireland, while the wider sector has seen significant corporate activity with the £1bn merger of Park Resorts and Parkdean Holidays, two caravan park operators. The company created from that merger, Parkdean Resorts, is also expected to lodge a bid for Forest Holidays, according to City sources. Acquired by Brookfield Property Partners in 2015 for £2.4bn, Center Parcs continues to report quarterly results under the terms of its financing. It said recently that in the 12 weeks to July 13, it recorded a 5% rise in group revenue to £99m, with earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation up 4.6% to £45.2m. A spokesman for Center Parcs declined to comment on Tuesday."

Number 10 also said that ministers are ready to show ""flexibility"" in the public sector pay round for the years 2018/19. Asked whether the introduction of flexibility in pay settlements meant that the cap was over, the spokesman said: ""The answer is yes."" The move came amid pressure from unions and Labour to scrap the policy, first introduced seven years ago. But unions were not impressed with the Government's effort. The GMB union said more pay for police and prison officers is ""smoke and mirror politics"" that insults public sector workers. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, told Sky News the announcement amounted to an ""insult"" and pointed out the rise was still below the inflation rate of 2.9%. ""They need to offer a real pay rise across the (public) sector, no cherry picking,"" she said. The seven-year public sector pay cap has been lifted for police and prison officers, as Government confirms pay rises. Here are the details pic.twitter.com/IX6HDNpCB7 Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said the announcement was a ""step in the right direction"" but did not go far enough. The Federation had asked for a 2.8% uplift to basic pay. ""Police officers do not join the service to make huge amounts of money, they do it out of a sense of duty and this year in particular have been tested to the max,"" Mr White said. ""However, they expect to be paid suitably for the immensely demanding role they perform and this simply is not the case."" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Elizabeth Truss said: ""Our talented and hardworking public-sector workers deserve to have fulfilling jobs that are fairly rewarded and I am pleased to confirm the pay awards for police and prison officers for 2017/18. ""The Government takes a balanced approach to public spending, dealing with our debts to keep our economy strong, while also making sure we invest in our public services."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable welcomed the move, saying: ""It is good to see the Government finally recognise that the public sector pay cap is no longer sustainable. ""The cap must now be lifted across the board so all public sector workers are given the pay rise they deserve."""

But the artwork, made by volunteers, was widely circulated on social media for the wrong reasons as many said it looked nothing like the late royal. Some claimed it bore more of a likeness to Worzel Gummidge, while others said it reminded them of a much-criticised statue of Cristiano Ronaldo. Jane Harris-Dyke described the Diana tribute as ""truly horrendous"". She said: ""It's so insulting to her memory. She was so beautiful and the painting so ugly."" Nicola Wallis-McCarty added: ""I doubt it was meant to cause offence, probably meant as a respectful gesture...sorry but it is a disgrace...it should be taken down immediately."" But Richard Pearson defended the memorial, which is placed in front of a well, telling critics to ""get a life"". He said: ""It's a well dressing not a real life portrait and it's a great tribute. Well done and keep up the traditions."" The tribute was made from flowers, egg shells, leaves and grass seeds and took 120 hours to create. A spokesman for Chesterfield Borough Council said it was a ""talking point"". He said: ""The well dressing is produced by 14 volunteers using the ancient Derbyshire art of well dressing, which involves creating designs from flower petals and other natural materials. ""All art is meant to be a talking point and that certainly seems to be the case with this year's design. ""The well dressing is designed to attract visitors to the area and if the publicity encourages more people to come and experience our historic market town and local shops then that can only be good for Chesterfield."" The council says a new well dressing is produced every year, each with a different theme. Previous themes have included the Golden Jubilee and Alice in Wonderland. This year's work will be on display in Chesterfield Market Place until Saturday."

The family travelled the country recruiting unemployed vulnerable men, setting them to work for meagre wages labouring for their various businesses. Almost all of the 18 victims had problems with drink and drugs or mental health issues. Extraordinarily, one of the men was held by the family for 26 years. Sentencing, Judge Timothy Spencer QC called it the ""wholesale exploitation of vulnerable men"". He told the family: ""Violence is a consistent theme in this case. ""Your victims had reached a position where they were cowed into submission. They knew that any resistance to you was futile - it would have been met by you recruiting more family members to deliver more violence. ""These offences are chilling in their mercilessness."" The victims were forced to live in ""squalid"" caravans or stable blocks often with no toilet or running water. Some of the victims had been allowed to leave and were later traced as part of the police investigation. One told police officers he felt he was sometimes treated no better than one of the family's dogs. On one occasion he was given leftovers to eat that were tossed to the ground for him to pick up. Unconcerned with legal requirements or employment standards, the Rooney family viewed the men simply as their workers. But Lincolnshire police are adamant they were modern-day slaves. Senior investigating officer Chief Superintendent Nikki Mayo said: ""The victims, whose identities will remain anonymous, were all adults aged between 18 and 63. ""Over time the victims became completely institutionalised and isolated from society."" She added: ""While their 'labourers' were suffering, this family were taking luxurious holidays to Barbados, Australia, Egypt and Mexico, the purchase of high performance BMWs, spa days and even cosmetic surgery. ""The greatest positive of this case is that so many of the victims have now got their lives back, they've got a real second chance at some peace and happiness and to grow and flourish in their communities - it's very much deserved.""

By mid-August there had been 70,000 cases of flu reported, with a high number of cases among children being blamed for driving up numbers. Just 10% of Australian children receive a flu vaccine. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said that while the service is well prepared for winter, with plans for between 2,000 and 3,000 more beds to be made available than last year, it faces much ""real pressure"" from the traditional peak of winter demand. He warned that GP services and hospitals will come under the most pressure if the H3 virus prevalent in the Antipodes replicates in the UK. ""The signs from the southern hemisphere winter have been that flu has been much higher and it has been the variety that puts the most pressure on the old people's services like care homes,"" Mr Stevens said. :: New flu patch an alternative to vaccine jab :: NHS at 'breaking point' after 'one of worst winters'  ""The World Health Organisation is reviewing the vaccines, and if that reproduces itself here over this coming winter that is going to mean much more pressure on GP services and hospitals."" The flu vaccine that will be made available to British patients has been developed by the World Health Organisation and will be passed to Public Health England. There have been suggestions in Australia that the vaccine has been ineffective, but Mr Stevens said the WHO was reviewing it and would not speculate on its effectiveness. ""It is the H3 strain [of the virus] but you get various subtypes and you also get virological drift where the flu evolves during the season,"" he said. Mr Stevens used his speech to the NHS Expo Conference in Manchester to stress that preparing for winter is a priority. ""For the next three to five months the priority is to make sure the NHS goes into winter in as strong a position as possible, he said. ""We know we have more beds open and we are better prepared but we know the pressures are going to be real. ""The sense from Australia and New Zealand is that it is going to be a heavy flu season and hospitals there have struggled to cope."" Pauline Philip, the National A&E Director, carried out a review of NHS preparation for winter with a view to ensuring there are 2,000 to 3,000 more beds available in hospitals across the country. ""In some parts of the country, clearly there are real pressures, so we are using the next six to eight weeks to really be clear what the plan there needs to be,"" Mr Stevens said. ""Our goal was that A&E performance should be back to 90 per cent (of patients being seen within four hours) by September and we are on track for that goal. Last winter, the UK suffered moderate levels of flu, mostly of the type A(H3N2) and predominantly seen in older adults."

He was appointed director of the National Theatre in 1973, where he was responsible for its move from the Old Vic to a purpose-built complex on London's South Bank. Sir Peter's successors in the role have praised his ""legendary tenacity"", ""mischievous wit"" and ""astonishing originality"". Amid his most famous work as a stage director was the English language premiere of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, and the world premieres of Harold Pinter's The Homecoming, No Man's Land and Betrayal. Sir Peter was diagnosed with dementia in 2011, more than 50 years after founding the Royal Shakespeare Company. After leaving the National Theatre in 1988, he formed the Peter Hall Company and became the founding director of the Rose Theatre Kingston. The current director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, said: ""We all stand on the shoulders of giants and Peter Hall's shoulders supported the entirety of British theatre as we know it. ""All of us, including those in the new generation of theatre-makers not immediately touched by his influence, are in his debt. His legendary tenacity and vision created an extraordinary and lasting legacy for us all."" Sir Nicholas Hytner said Sir Peter was ""up there with a line of impresarios that stretches back to Burbage"". He added: ""Without him there would have been no Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre's move to the South Bank might have ended in ignominious failure, and the whole idea of the theatre as a public service dedicated both to high seriousness and popularity would not have seized the public imagination."" Sir Richard Eyre, who took over the National Theatre in 1988, said: ""Peter created the template for the modern director - part-magus, part-impresario, part-politician, part-celebrity. ""He was - and is - the godfather (in both senses) of British theatre and like countless directors, writers and actors of several generations I have much to be grateful to him for."" Sir Peter is survived by his wife Nicki, his children Christopher, Jennifer, Edward, Lucy, Rebecca and Emma, and nine grandchildren."
2017-09-14,A Government commitment to fire safety testing transparency after the Grenfell Tower disaster has been watered down and less than 20% of the promised information released.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/govt-waters-down-commitment-to-fire-safety-testing-transparency-after-grenfell-11034886,"A pledge to publish previously secret results of fire tests on insulation and cladding used on tower blocks has been changed to exclude cladding systems that failed the safety test. Combustible insulation and panels fitted to Grenfell Tower have been blamed for the rapid spread of the fire on 14 June that killed 80 people. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) stated almost two months ago that testing and advisory firm BRE had been asked to ""publish the results of previous large scale (fire) tests"" on insulation and cladding to ""help inform building owners' decisions about whether remedial work is required"". :: Ex-judge opens Grenfell Tower fire inquiry The Government pledge was made in response to criticism of the secrecy surrounding fire testing from fire safety experts and the chairman of the Local Government Association Lord Porter. The Conservative peer said in a statement on 19 July that he was ""concerned"" that BRE ""does not feel able to release the results of previous cladding system tests"" on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. Tower block owners across the country were in the process of removing combustible cladding after ministers declared the system fitted to Grenfell Tower was banned in the UK. ""If the public are going to have faith in this fire safety testing process then everything needs to be out in the open. It is no time for contractors or manufacturers to withhold test results from both councils and the public,"" Lord Porter said. But when the fire test data was released on 5 September, BRE said it was only revealing tests on cladding that passed fire safety hurdles. In a further caveat it said test results would be withheld unless ""permission to publish details… has been granted by the customer"". After Sky News established that many successful tests were missing from that filtered list, BRE said it was ""working through"" more than 40 other successful test results and would publish them next week. The firm said it was ""checking with the customer and our accreditation body UKAS"" before publishing more of the ""40+"" successful tests its customers have given permission for inclusion. BRE has not responded to a series of questions including how many cladding systems failed the test and whether more than one fire test was carried out on any of the approved cladding systems in order for them to pass. The tests concerned are for the British Standard (BS) 8414 which governs the response to fire of cladding systems including those containing components used on Grenfell Tower. Since the tragedy, DCLG has paid BRE Global to fire test seven specific cladding systems, four of which failed, leaving 266 tower block owners with the task of urgently reassessing fire safety measures. Independent fire safety consultant Steve McKenzie said he was ""concerned"" about BRE's release of the data and questioned ""the commitment of DCLG and BRE to transparency"" in the aftermath of Grenfell. The admission that more than 80% of the data has yet to be released was made after Sky News identified two firms whose test results were not published last week. They discussed the issue on the understanding they would not be identified, saying they have pressed BRE Global to publish their results or explain why they were omitted, but have been unsuccessful. One said: ""(Our) tests should have been included. The company has been chasing up with BRE."" BRE Global is the only testing facility in Europe certified to conduct the BS8414 test, which involves exposing a large construction of insulation and cladding to a fierce fire. The cladding system is then deemed to have passed or failed a series of fire safety hurdles including how quickly the fire spreads and how quickly the material disintegrates. Sky News has previously revealed concerns from a leading lawyer about the involvement of two senior BRE figures in a Government panel advising ministers on what needs to be done to make tall buildings safe following the Grenfell Tower fire. Jolyon Maugham QC said Sir Ken Knight and Peter Bonfield are ""tainted by association"" through their links to advice given to ministers last year that building regulations were ""adequate"" to cope with combustible cladding on tower blocks."

Can't believe it got aired! #GBBO 😬 A third said: ""Epic fail by Noel, don't hide in a fridge; one of the first lessons of safety I learned as a child."" Ofcom said it was looking into the complaints before deciding if it would launch a formal investigation into whether the TV show breached broadcasting rules. In a statement, the regulator told Sky News: ""We are assessing all complaints against the broadcasting code, before deciding whether or not to investigate."" Children have accidentally died playing inside fridges & freezers. What was @Channel4   thinking of putting #GBBO  presenter in a fridge? The number of complaints was believed to be four times higher than when two Celebrity Big Brother contestants were shown sharing an intimate moment earlier this year. Ofcom dropped an investigation in 2014 after the Bake Off's famous ""Bingate"" incident which saw an ice cream being sabotaged and thrown in the rubbish. That incident drew more than 800 complaints from viewers."

Despite reports of scuffles earlier, things have been peaceful for the last 30mins outside stadium. #Emirates pic.twitter.com/dh03Fmi19q There were also reports of fighting inside the ground with FC Koln fans pictured fighting with stewards ahead of the Europa League tie. A Scotland Yard spokesman said a policing plan had been in place for the game and additional officers deployed.  There were four reported arrests for public order offences. Arsenal issued a statement on their website warning travelling fans they risked being kicked out of the ground if they bought tickets in the sections of the Emirates reserved for home supporters. ""Please note visiting supporters that purchase a ticket in the home end for this fixture are likely to be ejected from the stadium,"" the statement said. Despite this, Cologne fans were clearly visible in home sections all around the stadium ahead of the rescheduled kick-off. The game kicked off at 9.05pm. The German club are returning to European competition for the first time in a quarter of a century."

Mr Stewart's story was described as ""deeply upsetting and deeply troubling"" by Home Office minister Sarah Newton, who said the teacher involved had ""let themselves down and let their profession down"". During the debate, Labour MP Graham Jones revealed that his eight-year-old daughter had been the target of abusive comments online, and the perpetrators had ""disgracefully"" called themselves Labour members. He said: ""We have families. It's about time that some people woke up to the fact that we're not robots. ""We're not there to be abused and there are other people who are victims of this who are not on the ballot paper."" Vicky Ford, the Tory MP for Chelmsford, told the Commons that a partially sighted candidate had been threatened with rape - and was subjected to online abuse from someone who wanted to ""shoot her then pull the teeth out of her jaw while she fades away"". She also described how two Asian activists working for a Conservative candidate in Ealing were ""spat at, told they should have their throats slit (and) were threatened that they should die"". Ms Ford called for better guidelines to be introduced on how the police should react to such abuse in the future. Cabinet Office minister Chris Skidmore told MPs the Government would wait for a review by the Committee on Standards in Public Life before taking action.

2017-09-14,"""Historic"" reforms of education funding will see cash distributed according to the individual needs of each school, Justine Greening has confirmed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/justine-greening-hails-historic-school-funding-reforms-11035151,"The Education Secretary told the Commons the new ""national funding formula"" (NFF) was needed to address ""historic inequities in funding that have existed for far too long"". She said: ""It means for the first time the resources that the Government is investing in our schools will be distributed according to a formula based on the individual needs and characteristics of every school in the country. ""Not only will the National Funding Formula direct resources where they are most needed, helping to ensure that every child can get the high quality education that they deserve wherever they live, it will also provide that money through a transparent formula."" Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the announcement did ""nothing to reverse"" cuts schools were already facing. Ms Greening said the £1.3bn in extra funding that was announced in the summer meant overall budgets would rise by around £2.6bn in total from nearly £41bn in 2017/18 to around £42.4bn in 2018/19 and £43.5bn in 2019/20. She told the Commons she was increasing the basic level of funding that schools would get for each pupil. Under the new NFF the minimum per pupil funding level in 2019/20 would be at least £3,500 for primary school pupils and £4,800 for those at secondaries. According to the Department for Education, the new funding settlement will mean a minimum cash increase for every of 1% per pupil by 2019/20, with the most underfunded schools getting increases of 3% per pupil in 2018/19 and 2019/20. The department said there would also be a £110,000 lump sum for every school to help with fixed costs, as well as an extra £26m to rural and isolated schools to help them manage their unique challenges. As well as the basic funding per pupil, schools will get extra cash for additional needs, such as deprivation and low prior attainment of pupils. The proposals were first laid out in a consultation at the end of last year. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), welcomed the new funding formula, and stressed it was ""essential"" schools were funded fairly. ""Setting minimum funding levels for schools is also a welcome move, but we need to examine whether the levels announced today by the Secretary of State are sufficient,"" he said. ""We fear they are still way too low to allow schools to deliver the quality of education they want to provide and which pupils need."" Ms Rayner said the funding formula would mean a ""real terms cut"" in schools budgets because of inflation, accusing Ms Greening of ""simply cutting elsewhere to fill in the black hole that the Government itself has created""."

Claims that Mr Osborne, who was unceremoniously sacked by Mrs May when she took office last year, is pursuing a vendetta against the PM have been further fuelled by a recent magazine profile. The Esquire piece said Mr Osborne is reported to have told colleagues he will not rest until Mrs May is ""chopped up in bags in my freezer"". In a withering put down, Mr Rees-Mogg told LBC radio: ""The sadness of George Osborne is that he is a formidably able man, he served with distinction as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and has decided since leaving Parliament to emulate a rather less successful Edward Heath. ""I think this kind of bitterness and bile ends up making the person who has that bitterness and bile feel resentful and sad and has no effect on broader politics. ""His firepower diminishes with every bitter outburst and for so able a man that is something we should be sad about rather than particularly condemning."" Admitting he ""very rarely"" reads the Standard, the North East Somerset MP added: ""It's a local paper, it's not a national paper. ""I think if it doesn't like Mrs May for bilious reasons, its impact will diminish."" Mr Rees-Mogg, who was described in a recent satirical news piece as having been sent from 1923 to save his party, again talked down suggestions he could one day lead the Tories. Despite topping a poll of party members on who should succeed Mrs May, Mr Rees-Mogg insisted ""no one serious"" believes he is a viable candidate. He admitted the so-called Moggmentum was ""great fun while it lasts"", but stated he had no wish to ascend to the top job and was ""fully supporting"" Mrs May. Mr Rees-Mogg also took aim at European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, saying he was ""in cloud cuckoo land"" with his plans for closer EU integration. The Government should not pay Brussels ""a brass farthing"" in its withdrawal settlement, he claimed, and said Britain should simply leave its border with Ireland open and dare the EU to impose checks from the other side. Challenged over the recent growth in the number of food banks, Mr Rees-Mogg said this was down to a change in rules allowing JobCentre staff to tell clients of their availability. ""To have charitable support given by people voluntarily to support their fellow-citizens I think is rather uplifting and shows what a good, compassionate country we are,"" he said. ""Inevitably, the state can't do everything, so I think that there is good within food banks. ""The real reason for the rise in numbers is that people know that they are there and Labour deliberately didn't tell them."""
2017-09-14,"Karen Bradley, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, has referred 21st Century Fox's £18.5bn takeover of Sky plc, the owner of Sky News, to the UK's main competition watchdog.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/fox-takeover-of-sky-referred-for-six-month-cma-investigation-11034796,"Ms Bradley said on Tuesday that she was ""minded to"" refer the bid to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) but gave both companies 10 working days to respond to her. She told MPs on Thursday that, yesterday, she had received letters from both Fox and Sky confirming that, while they disagreed with that decision, they would ""not be making substantive representations in relation to it"". Ms Bradley said: ""As a result, I can confirm my decision is to refer the merger to the CMA for a Phase 2 investigation on media plurality and genuine commitment to broadcasting standards grounds."" The CMA is likely to take six months in which to decide whether the takeover can go ahead. Fox, the world's fourth-largest media company after Comcast, Disney and Time Warner, already owns a 39.1% stake in Sky. It tabled a proposal just before Christmas last year to buy the remainder of the company for £11.7bn, valuing the whole of Sky at £18.5bn. In March, Ms Bradley asked Ofcom, the media and telecoms regulator, to investigate, under the 2002 Enterprise Act, whether the takeover was in the public interest on the grounds of media plurality and broadcasting standards. Ofcom said there was no reason to think the deal was against the public interest on broadcasting standards grounds but indicated it did have concerns on plurality of media ownership. Ms Bradley was subsequently lobbied by a number of opponents of the deal, led by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader and Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and former business secretary, to assess new evidence concerning Fox's US operations and look into whether this would justify a referral to the CMA on grounds of broadcasting standards. Ofcom said earlier this week there were no grounds for referring the bid to the CMA on that issue - but Ms Bradley, in what has been seen as a hardening of the government's stance over the deal, insisted she was still minded to make a referral to the CMA. Her decision has led to criticism in some quarters. In an editorial column, published on Thursday, the Financial Times described Ms Bradley's decision as ""bizarre"". It added: ""The suspicion is that Ms Bradley, having not found Ofcom's ruling to her taste and under pressure from the Labour opposition, has decided to see if another regulator delivers a more expedient judgement. This sends a deeply troubling message to any business seeking to invest in Britain at a time of great uncertainty. ""With Brexit looming, investors need predictability and confidence in due process. The Fox-Sky bid demonstrates neither."" Shares of Sky, which are valued at 1075p each under the proposed takeover, were up 2p at 934p in mid-morning. That represents a discount of more than 13% to the offer price - suggesting scepticism among investors that the takeover will go ahead. Fox, the international film and television giant behind hit shows like The Simpsons and Modern Family, said: ""We look forward to engaging constructively with the CMA, as independent authority, and hope the findings of this process will be respected by the Secretary of State."" It said that, subject to further delays in the decision-making process, it anticipated that the deal would be closed by the end of June next year. Sky, which has previously been critical of delays to the process, said today: ""We note the swift decision to now refer this to the CMA and will continue to engage constructively in the process."" A separate competition review by the European Commission has already given a green light to the takeover. The deal has also been cleared by all of the other countries - Germany, Austria, Ireland and Italy - in which Sky broadcasts."

2017-09-14,"The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold - but warned a rise is ""likely"" in the ""coming months"" if inflation continues to surge.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/bank-rate-rise-likely-in-coming-months-if-inflation-jumps-11034913,"Minutes of the latest meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC) showed a 7-2 vote in favour of no change this month - keeping rates at their post-Brexit low of 0.25%. It was being closely watched as the decision was made just days after the Office for National Statistics revealed a leap in consumer price inflation to 2.9% last month from an annual rate of 2.6% in July. :: Cost of fashion pushes inflation to 2.9% The Bank has been growing increasingly wary about the threat posed to the economy from higher prices - with inflation above its 2% target. However, the MPC minutes also tempered expectations of a possible interest rate rise by saying it would depend not only on inflation rising further but also the economy maintaining its recent strength. Other data this week pointed to the lowest jobless rate since 1975 though wage growth remained stubbornly slow at 2.1%. When the inflation figure of 2.9% is taken into account it means the squeeze on family budgets is intensifying. Prices have risen because import costs were raised by the post-Brexit vote collapse in sterling's value. The currency gained more than a cent against the dollar - back above $1.33 to fresh one-year highs - after the MPC's rate deliberations came to light. It also rallied against the euro, trading back below the €0.89 mark, leaving the pound on track for its best week against the single currency in 10 months. The shifts hit the market values of multi-nationals, especially dollar-earners, on the FTSE 100 which was 1.14% lower at 7295 points. In signalling a growing lack of tolerance for rising prices, the MPC said: "" A majority of MPC members judge that, if the economy continues to follow a path consistent with the prospect of a continued erosion of slack and a gradual rise in underlying inflationary pressure then, with the further lessening in the trade-off that this would imply, some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months in order to return inflation sustainably to target. ""All members agree that any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent."" Commenting during an event launching the new £10 bank note, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ""We've all seen that prices are going up in the shops and that's been entirely the result of the fall in the value of sterling, which is due to Brexit. ""What the Bank has been doing since the referendum has been looking to balance support for the economy, as the economy adjusts to the prospect of Brexit, with our ultimate objective, which is to bring inflation back to that 2% target to make sure that the value of these notes and other notes stays stable. ""What you heard today is that the majority of the member of the committee, myself included, see that that balancing act is beginning to shift and that, in order to keep inflation or return inflation to that 2% target in a sustainable manner, there may need to be some adjustment of interest rates in the coming months. ""We'll take that decision based on the data but, yes, that possibility has definitely increased."" Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, reacted: ""To me, leaving rates where they are makes a great deal of sense. ""Throw a hefty dose of Brexit-related uncertainty into the mix and it's easy to see why the majority of policymakers see higher rates as an unjustified risk at this stage."""

2017-09-14,"Under normal circumstances, today's inflation figures would very likely be the precursor to a rise in interest rates this Thursday.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/will-inflation-rise-see-interest-rates-go-up-11031976,"Whenever the headline rate of inflation strays one percentage point either side of the 2% rate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is mandated to target, the Governor is obliged to write to the Chancellor, explaining why. With the consumer prices index at 2.9% in August, we are moving close to letter-writing territory. The chances are, though, that the MPC will continue to sit on its hands this week. The majority of its members have, during the last year, chosen to 'see through' the recent rise in inflation and treat it as a temporary phenomenon caused by the devaluation in the pound following the vote to leave the EU last year. :: Inflation hits 2.9% as fuel and clothing costs grow Mark Carney, the Governor, has also made clear on a number of occasions his concerns about the impact Brexit is likely to have on the economy. He strongly believes it is going to hit growth for a number of years and this is another reason why he has been so adamant that rates must stay lower for longer. The recent fragility in consumer spending is just one of a number of indicators that suggests the economy is losing momentum. That devaluation in the pound is certainly one of the main causes for the rise in inflation last month. Another, though, is the rally in the oil price which saw crude trading above $50 per barrel for most of August. It is currently back to levels last seen in mid-May. The MPC's expectation is that, towards the end of the year and into 2018, inflation should abate as the impact of the drop in the pound last year is 'lapped' and sterling-related price increases start to drop out of the year-on-year comparison. But there is no doubt that the pressure for an interest-rate rise is starting to build, as can be seen by the rise in the pound today on foreign exchange markets. Sterling has not traded at this level against the US dollar since 13 September last year, before the so-called ""flash crash"" that briefly saw it tumble on Far Eastern markets to $1.145. Against the euro, the best-performing currency among advanced economies this year, sterling's rally has been less spectacular. Ironically, this recovery against the US dollar may go some way towards providing insulation against further price rises, since the greenback is the currency in which most international commodities used by manufacturers are priced. Yet it will also have the effect of blunting the improvement in competitiveness that Britain's exporters have enjoyed as a result of sterling's devaluation. The dog that has not barked in all this is wage inflation. In spite of the jobless rate standing at a 42-year low, which ordinarily would spark a rise in wage inflation, earnings growth has stagnated. Until such time as earnings growth picks up - and perhaps the Government's decision to loosen its 1% cap on public sector pay rises may speed that process up - the MPC is likely to hold off raising the cost of borrowing."

She had reportedly been detained by undercover officers in a square just 100 yards from the school. Scotland Yard said: ""We are working with the school, which is attended by His Royal Highness Prince George, to review its security arrangements after the incident."" ""Police are part of the protective security arrangements for the Prince and we will continue to work closely with the school, which is responsible for building security on its site."" Several plain-clothed officers have been spotted in the area. Prince George's father, the Duke of Cambridge, said it had been an ""interesting week"" as he visited Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool on Thursday. Asked by a patient about the Duchess of Cambridge, who is expecting the couple's third child, William said she was doing ""very well"". The four-year-old prince, who started lessons last Thursday, was driven into the £17,604-a-year school through a side entrance on Thursday morning. He is attending half-day reception classes - building up to staying for lunch."
2017-09-14,"A record number of people have been arrested for terrorism-related offences, according to official figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/record-number-of-terror-related-arrests-11034789,"The Home Office has announced that there were 379 arrests in Britain in the 12 months to June. The figures include the dozens of arrests that took place following terrorist attacks in London and Manchester this summer. Of these 379 terror-related arrests over the last year, 12 were made in connection with the Westminster attack, 23 related to the Manchester Arena bombing and 21 arrests were related to the attack some time later at London Bridge. One arrest was related to the Finsbury Park attack in north London in June. Sky News Home Affairs Correspondent Mark White said: ""This 379 arrest figure is 68% higher than the 226 people who were arrested for the same period the year before. ""Significantly, it's the highest number of arrests in a year since they began recording terror arrest statistics back in 2001 after the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon in the US. ""It has been an exceptional year in terms of the way in which the police operations and intelligence services have been gathering intelligence and trying to bring people to justice after three terrorist attacks in quick succession."" A breakdown of the figures show that 54 of the arrested suspects were women - the largest female proportion on record - and 17 people held were under the age of 18. There was also a sharp rise of 92% (from 66 to 127) in the number of white suspects detained. While more than three quarters of the arrests were related to international terrorism, there was a sharp rise in the number of arrests for domestic terrorism (from 10 to 52). The 420% increase in terrorism with no international or Northern Island related links comes amid mounting concern over far-right extremism. The figures show that of those who have been arrested, 32% result in a charge. Mark White explained: ""Quite often what you see with the likes of a terrorist attack, a lot of people who are initially arrested - they could be family members, friends and associates of someone who has carried out an attack - but after questioning and detailed investigations these people are often released without charge. ""That's why we're looking at such a high number, but they are still pretty significant."" Five hundred investigations, involving 3,000 individuals, are being run by the police and MI5 at any one time. At least 20,000 former ""subjects of interest"" are also kept under review. Nineteen terrorist plots have been thwarted in the last four years, including six since the Westminster attack in March. The current UK threat level for international terrorism is severe, which means an attack is highly likely."

Firefighters were called to the three-storey building at around 5.40am local time on Thursday and took an hour to put out the blaze. Suspected to have been caused by an electrical short-circuit or a lit mosquito repellent coil, the fire broke out in the sleeping quarters on the school's top floor. The blaze began near the door of the dormitory - the only entrance - which along with the window grills, left the students unable to escape, according to fire officials. Police found 23 charred bodies among blackened bunks, 21 of them boys aged 13 to 17, and two teachers. Earlier reports suggested there were 24 victims in total. A local resident revealed the school had been operating for the last year. ""I saw their little hands out of the grilled windows; crying for help,"" she said. ""I heard their screams and cries but I could not do anything. The fire was too strong for me to do anything."" Another said: ""The children were crying for help, but I couldn't help them as the door was already on fire. ""I only managed to save a few of the kids who jumped out the window."" Kuala Lumpur police chief Amar Singh said the victims were likely to have suffocated from smoke inhalation, adding: ""The bodies were totally burnt."" It was claimed the bodies were piled on top of each other, suggesting a possible stampede as the victims tried to escape the flames. Another 14 students and four teachers were rescued, with six taken to hospital in a critical condition. The Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah is a private Islamic boarding school, known as a ""tahfiz"", where Muslim children - mainly boys - study and memorise the Koran. The school was said to have just been submitted to the city council for building safety approval, while - like many religious schools - it was claimed to be unlicensed with local authorities. Local media said 211 fires in private Islamic centres had been recorded since 2015."

Judge David Stockdale QC, told Buckley he subjected Miss Higginbottom to ""a savage and brutal attack"". ""You inflicted many wounds in cutting her throat and killing her. It was as cowardly and callous as it was brutal,"" he said. ""She would have had no idea it was coming. She would have been caught entirely off her guard. ""You were armed with a knife. She simply did not stand a chance. What must have been going through her mind is beyond imagining."" The A-level student from Wigan was reported missing by her family when she failed to return home from Winstanley College in Orrell on 16 June. Friends said she was last seen near Orrell Water Park, where there are two reservoirs surrounded by woodland. Just over six hours after the student was reporting missing, police found her body there. A post-mortem examination showed she died from multiple wounds to the neck. Sentencing Buckley for the ""frankly chilling"" murder, the judge said: ""You Mark Buckley had entered the park intending, as I find, upon attacking and sexually assaulting a female. ""You were carrying a bag later seen to contain items for sexual activity, together with a length of rope and cord. You were carrying a knife,"" he added. The student, who was slightly-built was not able to physically offer much resistance, said the judge. Buckley targeted Miss Higginbottom, who was hoping to become a vet, as she was walking home alone through the park after revising at the college. She was planning to return and meet up with friends who were sitting exams. Buckley planned to bury her body after dark, but when he returned to the park and moved her body, a police helicopter with heat-seeking equipment hovered overhead and he made off. Buckley was later arrested and admitted killing Miss Higginbottom, but could offer no explanation for his actions."
2017-09-14,The chairman of the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire says there is a debt owed to those who died to uncover the truth of the tragedy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/ex-judge-sir-martin-moore-bick-opens-grenfell-tower-fire-inquiry-11034904,"Retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick opened the inquiry with a 45-minute statement. At the beginning of proceedings, Sir Martin led a minute's silence in remembrance of the victims of the 14 June disaster. He described the deaths of at least 80 people in the west London tower block as ""a tragedy unprecedented in modern times"". :: Who is Sir Martin Moore-Bick? Sir Martin said he and his team would work to find out ""how a disaster of this kind could occur in 21st century London"" which, he hoped, would ""provide a small measure of solace"". His statement revealed: :: The inquiry will have two phases, although both will be conducted in parallel. :: The first will focus on how the fire started and spread, along with the events in the hours until it was extinguished. :: The second will examine ""how the building came to be so seriously exposed to the risk of a disastrous fire"", including past communication between residents and local authorities over the tower's safety. It will also look at the response in the days after the disaster. :: The inquiry's terms of reference are ""deliberately"" broad to allow Sir Martin to ""pursue whatever lines of inquiry seem likely to be fruitful"". :: A further list of issues the inquiry will look at has been published :: He hopes to begin taking evidence from witnesses by the end of this year :: He will aim to produce a first report on the inquiry's first phase by Easter 2018 :: The process of gathering evidence has ""already begun in earnest"" The former High Court judge paid tribute to the firefighters who battled the Grenfell Tower inferno and local residents who ""have done so much to help and support each other in these very difficult weeks"". He also expressed his astonishment that some of those children caught up in the disaster had returned to school the day after the fire to sit exams. Sir Martin said there was an ""entirely natural and understandable"" sense of ""anger and betrayal"" within the local community after their world was turned ""upside down"". But, promising to work ""calmly and rationally"", he warned his job is not ""to punish anyone or to award anyone compensation"" but ""simply to get at the truth"". :: Grenfell: The victims Yet, Sir Martin insisted he will ""not shrink"" from making any findings or recommendations even if parties may later face civil or criminal liability. Police are currently conducting their own investigations over possible criminal offences, which Scotland Yard has said could include corporate manslaughter charges. Sir Martin also vowed not to hesitate in using his statutory powers in order to obtain documents needed for the inquiry's work. Urging all parties involved in his inquiry to co-operate, Sir Martin said: ""We are all searching for the truth. ""We owe it to those who died to work together to achieve that goal."" Reverend Mike Long of the Notting Hill Methodist Church, close to Grenfell Tower and where a video stream of Sir Martin's statement was broadcast on Thursday, offered a cautious welcome of the retired judge's words. He told Sky News: ""It's interesting that he's used those words, particularly the word 'betrayal', because that's exactly how many here feel. ""An acknowledgement of the word 'betrayal', which is a very strong word, at least gives some indication that there is an understanding of the lack of trust that many local people have and have had in local authorities here. ""And perhaps that might enable the inquiry to be able to find ways to reassure the public, particularly local residents, that they are being utterly transparent and are looking at the deeper causes of this appalling tragedy."" Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad described Sir Martin's statement as a ""cold, clinical process"". The Labour politician said: ""There has been huge anxiety about how this would happen. ""A lot of anxiety - and some people have literally come out here today for the first time. They've been stuck, they've been within their community. ""They made a huge effort to come here and then what do we have - it was a very cold, clinical process and then the judge got up and walked out. ""It was very odd, I found it quite strange."""
2017-09-14,"Britain should make a ""clean break"" from the European Union instead of pursuing any kind of interim deal, according to one of the country's best-known businessmen.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-should-make-a-clean-break-from-eu-says-james-dyson-11034559,"Sir James Dyson told Sky News that a transitional agreement would be ""a muddle"". ""You end up having to do one transitional arrangement, and then another one. So just have a clean break, it's not a big deal."" Sir James, who backed the Brexit campaign in 2016, said he was comfortable with Britain instead switching to the tariff system used by the World Trade Organisation, and to turning its attention away from Europe. ""Europe is a declining part of world trade,"" he said. ""It's now down to 12% and in about five years' time it will be 9% of world trade. The fastest growing sector is, of course, in the far east, China and the far eastern countries where we're growing by about 80% or 90% a year. That's where the opportunities are - not Europe."" Sir James said he had no regrets about Brexit but stressed the need for international talent. Dyson employs around 3,500 people in the UK, and that figure is expected to almost double in the coming four or five years. To help feed that growth, Dyson has plans to recruit a huge number of engineers, but Sir James said he often struggled to find recruits in this country who had the appropriate skills. His solution is a bold one. Dyson is investing in creating a university on the site of his company's huge Wiltshire campus. Students will be paid to work, but will also complete an undergraduate degree in engineering. He said: ""There is a huge shortage of engineers in Britain - it's estimated we'll be two million engineers short by 2022 - but more interestingly we're short of very good engineers. We want to develop the best tech in the world and make products that conquer the world. ""It's blindingly obvious that we need to take on more engineers, and if people study here then they'll be learning from some of the best in the world."" It is, he says, Britain's first new university for 40 years. It is also a response to a changing world. Sir James fears that Britain has lost its passion for engineering, and embraced ""soft subjects"" instead. The nation of Brunel and Stephenson, he fears, is being left behind. ""It's a major game of catch up, because even the Philippines produces more engineers than we do, and so does Mexico. ""In our schools we've lost interest in engineering. As a nation, we have lost confidence in grand engineering projects."" He thinks there should be no restrictions on overseas students coming to the UK, saying that 60% of engineering students in UK universities are coming from outside the EU. The first intake of students who will study at his own institute are all British, but he says that will change in the coming years."
2017-09-14,The family of a man who spent 11 years in prison even though he was jailed for 10 months have vowed to carry on fighting the rules that kept him inside.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/campaign-to-end-indeterminate-sentences-after-arsonist-on-10-month-jail-term-serves-11-years-11035466,"James Ward was given an indeterminate Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) which meant he would only be released when officials deemed it safe. The 32-year-old received the sentence because he had set fire to his bed while serving a one-year jail term for another offence. His family had made repeated pleas to the Parole Board to release him on the grounds of his repeated self-harm and mental health, but all of their requests were refused. Ward was finally told he would be freed on Thursday morning, bringing an end to years of battling by his sister April. IPPs were introduced in 2005 but scrapped in 2012 after then justice secretary Ken Clarke called them a ""stain"" on the judicial system. Ms Ward told Sky News she was thrilled when she got the call confirming her brother was coming home. ""I just couldn't stop crying. I was just so overwhelmed with emotion,"" she said. ""It's taken 12 years of hard fighting, for us as a family and for James. It was all emotions today."" Ms Ward said her brother is not planning anything beyond just being able to experience life outside prison - but they are determined to prevent others having to go through what they say they have suffered. She added: ""It ruins the good times, because even when you are trying to celebrate something, it was in the back of my mind that James was sat in a cell, or even in segregation or alone. That... has been absolutely heartbreaking. ""James dreams of walking down the street - the novelty of going to a park. His dreams are very small, as they would be if you had been in prison for 12 years. Together we'll make sure those dreams get bigger."" Ms Ward said she is going to ""fight IPP to the very end"" with her brother to help other families affected by these sentences. In a letter sent to his family last year, James said he was losing hope of ever being released. He had written: ""I'm banged up in my cell, all that's in here is a bed, a cupboard, a toilet and a sink. ""I'm going crazy, mum, and I've had enough of this place."" The controversial orders were supposed to be for prisoners whose crimes were not deemed serious enough for conventional life sentences, but who were thought to pose a significant risk to the public nonetheless. In August, the chairman of the Parole Board called for the Government to ""get a grip"" on the issue of indeterminate sentences - and criticised the ""unacceptably high"" rate of suicides, assaults and self-harm within prisons. At the time it was thought that around 3,300 prisoners were still being held under IPPs, with hundreds of them ""years over tariff""."
2017-09-14,"What is it with truly great comedians, that they spend most of their lives trying to figure out who they really are?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/jim-carrey-doesnt-exist-anymore-11031993,"Buster Keaton, Andy Kaufman, Robin Williams - since comedy was silent, the funniest actors have sprung from the saddest men. When cloaks fall, there is alcoholism, cancer and depression. It shocks us because we're used to seeing them smile and making us laugh. For Carrey, it was a tragic incident, the suicide of his girlfriend, which seems to have catapulted him from The Cable Guy to one of the most interesting artists in Hollywood. Two years ago, Cathriona White was found dead in her apartment. She had been dating the actor for three years. Photos taken at her funeral show a shattered Carrey carrying her coffin on his shoulders. But from that point on, he was nowhere to be seen; no films, no guest show appearances. The actor who once made four films in a year became a recluse. Then, nearly two years later, a short film was spotted online, showing the 55-year-old star painting weird, fluorescent canvases showing Jesus faces and bleeding hearts. ""I needed colour,"" he says to the camera. So he went and got it. At first, I wasn't sure what I was looking at. Is it a sketch? A mockumentary? Is he teasing us - the media, the audience? With comedians, you never know. But then, somewhere throughout the film, Carrey's paintings became interesting to me - they felt true. So did his words. ""You can choose not to do it,"" he says, his voice a distant echo. ""You can choose to try to do something safer."" ""Your vocation chooses you,"" he said. He might have a point, I thought. Jim Carrey: I Needed Color from JC on Vimeo. Whether or not you think his art is any good, here's a public figure taking an enormous risk being someone people don't want him to be. Serious, sad, troubled - is there anything less funny? After that, a series of headline-friendly interviews followed. Public outbursts, philosophical rants. The latest one happened at a fashion show in New York, when the actor was spotted walking the red carpet by a reporter. ""There's no meaning to any of this,"" he started by saying. ""I wanted to find the most meaningless thing I could come to and join and here I am."" The fashion reporter, in her obliviousness, reminded the actor the gala was celebrating ""icons"". ""Don't you believe in icons?"" she asks. He laughed. ""Boy, that is just the absolute lowest-aiming possibility that we could come up with,"" Carrey added, and then proceeded to explain why he does not, in fact, believe in icons - but rather personalities. ""I don't believe that you exist, but there's a lovely fragrance in the air,"" he tells the reporter. The media had a field day. ""Bonkers interview,"" said Esquire I get it. Stars annoy us. Particularly those who, at a certain point, refuse to play ball. And although I tend to sympathise with any good star-bashing member of the public, with Carrey, I don't want to. Because he is right. Fashion shows are meaningless, ""icons"" are ridiculous, peace does ""lie beyond invention in disguise"". ""I believe it's deeper than that,"" he tells the camera. In Venice earlier this month, he premiered a documentary titled Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond. In it, he shows behind the scenes footage of his most brilliant and most misunderstood role, in Milos Forman's Man On The Moon. In the film, he is the comedian Andy Kaufman and his own alter-ego, Tony Clifton. In the end, Andy dies but Tony lives on. In the documentary, Carrey claims he was not himself playing the film, but Kaufman. ""Jim Carrey didn't exist at that time,"" he said. He wasn't talking about method acting, I don't think. I believe that he believes that, at a certain point, Jim, Andy and Tony were one. One comedian, performing on stage - pretending to be someone he's not. Jim Carrey has stopped making us laugh. Like with Kaufman, Keaton or Williams before him, we are left faced with a deeper persona than what we paid for. Now, he is defying us. Making us think about the absurdity of our world. I welcome that, and firmly believe he will be funny once again - great comedians always are."
2017-09-14,The Government's top legal adviser is examining whether social media is undermining the integrity of the court system.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/attorney-general-to-examine-if-court-system-is-undermined-by-social-media-11036095,"The Attorney General is launching a Call for Evidence to assess whether changes need to be made to protect against ""trial by social media"". Jeremy Wright QC MP told Sky News: ""There was a murder trial, one of the most serious trials you can contemplate that had to be stopped because of social media commentary that has been happening about the defendants and trial more generally. ""The judge had to stop the trial completely, it had to be moved physically to a different part of the country and the trial begun again."" In another high profile case, the protected identity of one of the murderers of Merseyside toddler James Bulger was revealed on Twitter. The person responsible was given a suspended prison sentence and a hefty fine. The problem is if one post goes viral it can soon be seen by thousands of people, including jurors, and that could prejudice proceedings. Contempt of Court laws were designed to prevent the media unfairly reporting court cases. The trouble is, many social media users are unaware any comments they make online are considered ""publications"" and therefore subject to the same restrictions. Media law barrister Christina Michalos explained: ""If you've got something to say, say it privately, say it behind closed doors to your friends and family, but don't put it on social media because you could be risking the collapse of a criminal trial and the huge public cost which will cost all of us as the taxpayer."" The Attorney General wants to hear from victims groups, solicitors and judges to determine the scale of the problem. Mr Wright added: ""I am looking for expert evidence on whether the increasing influence and ubiquity of social media is having an impact on criminal trials and if so, whether the criminal justice system has the tools it needs to manage that risk."" The Call for Evidence will end on 8 December. A report will be written outlining what, if any, action should be taken."
2017-09-14,"The Prime Minister said the decision was ""historic"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170915031218/http://news.sky.com/story/parliament-supports-eu-withdrawal-bill-but-threat-of-brexit-rebellion-remains-11031615,"But it seems clear she also knows Parliament's approval for the EU Withdrawal Bill to proceed to its next stage was unmistakably conditional. To have marshalled enough parliamentary discipline to avoid any Conservative or DUP rebellion - while also seeing seven Labour MPs join them in the voting lobbies - will be savoured as a victory for Theresa May, not least on a matter as traditionally divisive for her party as Europe. But her acknowledgement on Tuesday morning that ""there is more to do"" is a significant understatement. Numerous Conservative MPs have expressed deep concern about the anti-democratic impact of the bill in its current form, and have made it abundantly clear there is a price to pay for their midnight support. As dawn broke, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also gave signals the Government understood the terms, telling Sky News it was right that Parliament look into the detail of the bill, insisting ministers would be ""listening"". On the Conservative benches, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, former business minister Anna Soubry and former chancellor Ken Clarke were among those who chose not to pull the trigger on a rebellion on Monday night. However, the gun is still loaded and if serious changes are not made as MPs in committees dissect the bill line by line, it may yet be used. Indeed, up to 12 Tory MPs are believed to already be backing amendments tabled for consideration by committee. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has also made clear he intends to make the committee stage of the bill as testing for the Government as possible, despite the divisions within his own party that Monday night's vote exposed. Labour's amendments have already been tabled - focused on watering down the executive powers given to ministers to make law with limited parliamentary scrutiny, securing protections on human rights and environmental standards, and ensuring devolved powers remain devolved. But Sir Keir is also suggesting the bill may be already beyond repair - arguing the Prime Minister should have dropped it and started again, rather than burdening Parliament with the task of mangling the current form into something more acceptable to those who opposed its second reading. ""This is likely to cause delays and division in Parliament, and the Prime Minister has nobody to blame but herself,"" SIr Keir said. However, when it comes to the other opposition parties, it is not just the Government but Labour they hold in contempt. The Liberal Democrats accused Labour rebels of handing the government victory, while Plaid Cymru said Labour's lack of unity risked ""letting the Tories off the hook"". But Labour rebels seem far less likely at another crucial Commons vote due to be held once more in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Government is seeking to grant itself a majority on the selection committee - the body which chooses the make-up of MPs on the standing committees that scrutinise legislation - another step which the opposition parties have labelled a ""power grab"". The controversy lies in the fact that the Conservatives have no outright majority and therefore, critics say, the balance should be equally split between Labour and the Tories. Not so, argue the Government - pointing to the fact they have a majority on the floor of the House with DUP support that will see the motion pass, and therefore a majority on the selection committee is warranted to avoid logjams in the business of legislating. The critical question will be whether any so-called ""constitutionalists"" on the Tory benches, who grudgingly nodded the EU Withdrawal Bill to its next stage, feel this is a step too far."

Mr Brokenshire's comments come as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein hold intensive private talks to establish whether there is any prospect of an agreement to re-form a government. Speaking on Thursday, the Conservative MP declared: ""If things don't change we are on a glide path to greater and greater UK government intervention. ""But I believe we can change course. ""This can be achieved with political leadership and with support of the people of Northern Ireland - including communities and businesses."" Mr Brokenshire added that the nine months without a government to steer policy had left the country with ""no political direction"" and left critical public service reform wanting. He cautioned that any need to pass a budget for the country from London would be a profound step backwards. ""But in the continuing absence of devolution the UK Government retains ultimate responsibility for good governance and political stability in Northern Ireland as part of the UK,"" the MP said. ""We will not shirk from the necessary measures to deliver that."" The late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned at the start of 2017 and plunged the devolved institutions led by his party and the DUP into crisis.

That may not sound like much, given that the pound was trading at $1.50 before news of the Leave vote came through, but it does represent a significant recovery given that, around the time of the 'flash crash' on 7 October last year, some wild-eyed souls in the currency markets were talking seriously about the pound going all the way to $1.05. Against the euro, the gains have been less dramatic, reflecting the single currency's status as the best-performing major currency this year. Sterling's recent rally has merely brought it back to levels seen in mid-July. However, given that it was not that long ago that some people were speculating the pound might hit parity against the euro, it still represents a solid recovery. No one is talking any more about one pound being equal in value to one euro, at least, not outside the price-gouging currency exchange units at one or two UK airports. The reason for this rally, of course, is that the market is starting to price in an interest rate rise. A series of events have given this sentiment impetus, including news on Tuesday this week that consumer price inflation had hit 2.9% and Wednesday's news of another drop in the jobless rate to just 4.3%. This was followed on Thursday by minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee that revealed a majority of members believe that, in the absence of bad news, ""some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months"". That was reinforced in a speech on Friday by Gertjan Vlieghe, previously seen as one of the 'doves' on the MPC, in which he said ""the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when Bank rate may need to rise"". Mr Vlieghe added that this ""may be as early as the coming months"". These developments raise two questions. The first is the extent to which Bank Rate may have to increase. There is a school of thought in the market that the UK economy, in spite of the robust job creation figures, is losing momentum and may continue to do so while uncertainty persists over the Brexit deal that the UK is going to strike with the EU. That is certainly believed to be the view of Mark Carney, the Bank's governor. If shared by most other members of the MPC, it could mean monetary policy could merely be tightened to the extent of reversing last year's emergency rate cut made by the Bank following the Leave vote, bringing Bank rate back to 0.5%. This view, summed up in the phrase 'one and done', has it that the UK economy faces several years of uncertainty and that household finances are still quite fragile. The jobless rate may be falling but earnings growth is not keeping pace with inflation. Some UK households, it is argued, might struggle to meet their mortgage repayments even if there is a modest rate rise. Yet there is also a case for going further. Inflation is well ahead of the Bank's central target of 2%, unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and the UK economy is set to grow this year at around 1.7% which, while low, is not wildly out of kilter with the growth rates seen since the global financial crisis. Add to that the fact that the UK stock market is now into the eighth year of its current bull run and, on Wall Street, the rally has been going on longer than that. We are due another big stock market reversal together with the hit to confidence that would involve. Raising rates further now, it can be argued, will give the Bank scope to cut them again if it needs to rebuild confidence in the future. The other question is whether the MPC can be believed when it makes hawkish noises of the kind it has been this week. Mr Carney has, in the past, dropped heavy hints that interest rate rises are on the way - most famously at a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 and at Lincoln Cathedral in 2015 - only for him not to follow through with them. This led Labour MP Pat McFadden, then a member of the Treasury Select Committee, to dub him the ""unreliable boyfriend"". There are, however, alternatives to raising interest rates. One would be to start unwinding the Bank's £435bn worth of asset purchases undertaken since the financial crisis - Quantitative Easing in the jargon - which would have a similar impact to raising longer-term interest rates. Another would be to call a halt to the Term Funding Scheme, part of the stimulus package that was introduced after the Brexit vote, which aimed to ensure that banks passed on the full extent of the emergency rate cut. There is a view that all the scheme has done is fatten the profits of the banks and helped pump up another bubble in consumer borrowing - something about which the Bank itself has been worrying. A final measure that could be taken to stop consumer borrowing expanding dangerously could be taken by the Treasury, rather than the Bank, which would be to end the Help to Buy scheme. All the evidence suggests that this measure, introduced by the former Chancellor George Osborne in the hope of winning a few votes from would-be homeowners, has merely boosted the profitability of the housebuilders by stimulating demand for homes without doing anything to encourage building more of them."
2017-09-15,It was at 6.42am in Washington that Donald Trump tweeted himself into another diplomatic row with the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916035100/http://news.sky.com/story/trump-scolded-by-police-and-pm-for-unhelpful-tweets-after-london-attack-11037017,"His assertion that the London attackers ""were in the sights of Scotland Yard"" was either the revelation of shared intelligence or what the Prime Minister called unhelpful speculation. Either way, it has done some damage to that much vaunted ""special relationship"" - and Sky News understands that Theresa May raised Mr Trump's tweets in a phone call with the President on Friday afternoon. :: Live updates - Tube terror blast Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive! Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better! Earlier, in Downing Street, Mrs May had said: ""I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation."" The Metropolitan Police echoed the Prime Minister's concerns, as Mr Trump's comments did not correspond with any information released by the UK authorities. Mr Trump offered little clarity during an appearance in the sunshine of the Rose Garden a few hours later. Although he confirmed he had been briefed on London, the President did not say whether that briefing happened before or after his tweets. :: Witness - 'Fireball flew through carriage' The whole event was a little surreal: the President had gone outside to watch an 11-year-old called Frankie Giaccio mow the lawn (Frankie had written to the White House asking if he could) and ended up talking international affairs. So, as Frankie's mower roared into life, Mr Trump turned and strode to the Oval Office to - he said - place a call to Theresa May... and perhaps try to repair some of that damage. A Downing Street spokesperson later confirmed a conversation had taken place, saying: ""President Trump called the Prime Minister earlier today to offer his condolences over this morning's cowardly attack in London."" And the White House said Mr Trump had pledged close collaboration with the UK ""to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism"". The President has form with London attacks. He and his son Donald Trump Jr both mocked Sadiq Khan after taking the mayor's words of reassurance to Londoners out of context. That happened after the Westminster Bridge and Borough Market attacks. :: What we know about Parsons Green attack After the Manchester Arena attack, intelligence from the UK investigation - including the name of the attacker and photos of his device - was leaked by US government sources to the American media. Mr Trump wasn't responsible, of course, but US secretary of state Rex Tillerson was dispatched to London to head off a full-blown diplomatic row after intelligence sharing was briefly suspended. The President did share highly classified intelligence about suspected IS plans, until then closely guarded among US allies, with the Russian foreign minister during a meeting at the White House. He later said he had an ""absolute right"" to do so but it prompted criticism that he was careless in exposing intelligence gatherers to increased risk. :: Timeline of UK terror attacks in 2017 His tweets about the London attack will attract similar accusations of carelessness. If Mr Trump had insight into the UK investigation, should he have publicly shared it? Was he criticising Scotland Yard and the British intelligence services for not acting sooner? His tweets tend to be aimed at his base, bolstering his image as tough on immigration and terrorism and with little thought to the wider world. A rebuke from his friend, the British Prime Minister, should remind him of the damage they can also do."

He said: ""In the current negotiations, democratically-elected politicians from the UK are dealing with unelected oligarchs from the EU. ""Since the oligarchs are not subject to judgement at the ballot box, their approach is dictated by more sectarian factors - the interests and ideology of EU apparatchiks like them, rather than residents or businesses from EU countries. ""As a result of their current posturing and threats, EU negotiators are inevitably encouraging importers like Wetherspoon to look elsewhere for supplies. ""This process is unlikely to have adverse effects on the UK economy, as companies will be able to switch to suppliersrepresenting the 93% of the world's population which is not in the EU, but this evolution will eventually be highly damaging to the economy of the EU. ""Wetherspoon is extremely confident that it can switch from EU suppliers, if required, although we would be very reluctant to initiate such actions."" The FTSE 250 firm announced record sales and profits for its last financial year - suggesting little harm from a weaker pound raising its import costs. It reported a 15.6% increase in profit before tax to £76.4m in the 53 weeks to 30 July on sales of almost £1.7bn - up 4% on the previous year. The company said strong summer trade since the end of its financial year meant that comparable sales were up 6.1% - but it did not expect that performance to continue and its profit expectations for 2017/18 were unchanged. Shares were up more than 7% when trading opened."
2017-09-15,This latest missile launch was not unexpected.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916035100/http://news.sky.com/story/n-korea-missile-test-what-message-is-kim-jong-un-trying-to-send-11036143,"South Korean intelligence sources had reported movement of North Korean launch vehicles early last week, while there had been speculation a test would be timed to coincide with a national holiday on 9 September. Had that happened, it would have been interpreted as a show of strength by Kim Jong Un - a signal, on the anniversary of the country's founding, of where it is heading under his leadership - towards the nuclear deterrent his citizens are told is the only means to secure their survival. Instead, coming as it does now four days after the UN Security Council passed its strongest sanctions resolution yet, this will now be seen as a statement of North Korea's defiance - a furious rejection of the measures being imposed upon it by the international community. There may be truth to both, but in trying to interpret the precise message each individual missile is intended to send, we should not lose track of the bigger, crystal clear message the Kim regime is telegraphing over and over again. Kim is telling us directly where this is heading - he's trying to develop nuclear weapons, capable of reaching the mainland United States, and he is very nearly there. This is his signature policy. It's known as ""Byungjin"", and it calls for the simultaneous development of nuclear weapons and the economy. There is no mystery here, apart from perhaps how the development of the economy is compatible with the pursuit of weapons that bring ever-increasing sanctions, further impoverishing his people. Presumably that part is intended to come later. What is less clear is Kim's motive. The argument North Korean officials make, and several have made to me, is that countries without nuclear weapons are vulnerable to US-led regime change. They cite the examples of Libya and Iraq, and the fate of Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein. Under this rationale, the deterrent - with the ability to threaten the United States directly - is a means to ensure the continued existence of a regime that North Koreans are told is under constant threat from hostile ""US imperialist aggressors"". The good news is that if this is the motivation, they would be very unlikely to ever actually use their weapons. A regime concerned primarily with its own self-preservation would be unlikely to trigger the very conflict that would almost certainly ensure its demise. The danger comes later, if Kim then believes he has impunity; the US alliance with South Korea and Japan is weakening; and his ability to strike the American homeland would dissuade them from intervening to prevent the reunification of the Korean peninsula by force. At this stage we cannot know Kim's true intentions - what we do know is that despite the condemnation and the international sanctions, he shows absolutely no sign of voluntarily abandoning his nuclear or missile programmes. And there will be more launches to come."

Islamic State says a ""detachment"" of the terror group was behind the attack at Parsons Green station at the height of Friday morning's rush hour. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley has said police are ""chasing down suspects"" - but warned it is routine for IS to say they carried out attacks irrespective of whether they were involved or not. This is the fourth time that the terror threat level has been placed at ""critical"" in the past 11 years - with Mr Rowley adding that the extra military support will free up 1,000 armed police officers. :: LIVE - IS says it carried out attack Announcing the change in threat level, the Prime Minister said: ""The public will see more armed police on the transport network and on our streets, providing extra protection. ""This is a proportionate and sensible step which will provide extra reassurance and protection while the investigation progresses."" Military personnel will also replace officers ""on guard duties at certain protected sites which are not accessible to the public"". The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""The national threat level has now been raised to 'critical' after the evil and cowardly terrorist attack at Parsons Green. ""As the Prime Minister has said, this is our highest level of security preparedness. ""I utterly condemn the hideous individuals who target innocent people and attempt to use terror to harm us and destroy our way of life."" :: Police and PM scold Trump for tweets Earlier, Mrs May condemned the ""cowardly attack"", and said the improvised explosive device was ""intended to cause significant harm"". She chaired a meeting of the Government's emergency COBRA committee on Friday afternoon, and urged the public ""to go about their daily lives but remain vigilant"". The Prime Minister added: ""The police and the security services are obviously doing all the work to discover the full circumstances of this cowardly attack. ""The threat of terrorism that we face is severe, but by working together we will defeat them."" Counter-terror police, who are being assisted by MI5, are scouring CCTV in their hunt for the bomber. Investigators are also examining the improvised explosive device, which is understood to have had a timer. :: 'Firewall flew down carriage and we jumped out' Photographs from the scene showed a large flaming bucket with wires coming from it on the floor of the carriage. Mrs May has said the Government is ""looking very carefully at the powers that our police and security services have to make sure they have the powers they need"". She has also criticised US President Donald Trump over a tweet in which he claimed the Parsons Green bomber was ""in the sights"" of Scotland Yard - and called such speculation was not helpful. The Metropolitan Police also said Mr Trump's comments were ""unhelpful"" and ""pure speculation"". :: Scale of anti-terror probes 'unprecedented' Mr Khan, who clashed with Mr Trump over his response to the London Bridge terror attack, would not be drawn on the President's comments. ""Simply been too busy this morning to look at my Twitter,"" he told LBC radio. ""My priority is making sure that we do what we can do to keep London safe."" A City Hall source said: ""He hopes people don't speculate on things before we know the full facts. That's quite clear what he thinks about that."""

Thousands of ticketless away fans were refused entry. They had earlier brought central London to a standstill and police said a number of flares had been discharged by the supporters. Posts on social media sites showed large numbers of Cologne fans singing and marching around Oxford Circus. Despite reports of scuffles earlier, things have been peaceful for the last 30mins outside stadium. #Emirates pic.twitter.com/dh03Fmi19q There were also reports of fighting inside the ground with FC Koln fans pictured fighting with stewards ahead of the Europa League tie. A Scotland Yard spokesman said a policing plan had been in place for the game and additional officers deployed. The spokesman said the five people were arrested on suspicion of public order offences. Arsenal issued a statement on their website warning travelling fans they risked being kicked out of the ground if they bought tickets in the sections of the Emirates reserved for home supporters. Despite this, Cologne fans were clearly visible in home sections all around the stadium ahead of the rescheduled kick-off. Speaking after the match, which Arsenal won 3-1, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said Cologne supporters had been ""very clever"" to enter the stadium undetected, with both sides likely to face UEFA charges in the coming days. ""They were very clever...I don't know how they managed to infiltrate our fans and get everywhere but they did that very well. I don't know if they went through Arsenal membership, on the internet... they did very well."" Cologne coach Peter Stoger refused to be questioned on the actions of the club's supporters: ""I have no comment about the fans,"" he said. ""I'm the coach, my job is the team, my job is football not the fans."" A club spokeswoman added: ""We have to first inform ourselves and in the next few days we will talk about that."" Scotland Yard confirmed there had been no reports of any ""significant incidents"" following the match, which eventually kicked off at 9.05pm.

It flew over Hokkaido in northern Japan and fell into the Pacific Ocean, sparking a nationwide alert. US Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis said the launch ""put millions of Japanese into duck and cover"", although residents in northern Japan appeared to remain calm. US Pacific Command said an initial assessment indicated the launch of an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM). It added that the projectile did not pose a threat to North America or the US Pacific territory of Guam, towards which Pyongyang had previously threatened to launch a missile. :: Key steps in North Korea's nuclear ambitions The UN Security Council said it will hold an emergency meeting on Friday, while US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on all nations to take ""new measures"" against the North. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the provocation ""trampled on the international society's desire for a peaceful solution"" and that ""the reckless act"" was ""absolutely unacceptable"". A spokesman fro Russian President Vladimir Putin criticised the latest launch and warned it will lead to a spike in regional tensions. China meanwhile called for all sides to seek dialogue to reduce tensions. The launch comes a day after North Korea threatened to ""sink Japan"" and reduce the US to ""ashes and darkness"" for supporting a UN Security Council resolution imposing new sanctions. :: North Korea hit by new United Nations sanctions The sanctions followed the North's sixth nuclear test, and by far its most powerful, on 3 September. Meanwhile, the US General who oversees America's nuclear forces said he believes North Korea did in fact test a hydrogen bomb on 3 September. Although Pyongyang claimed it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, the US had previously declined to characterise it. :: What does Kim Jong Un really want? Air Force General John Hyten, head of the US military's Strategic Command, said: ""I'm assuming it was a hydrogen bomb. I have to make that assumption as a military officer. ""I'm not a nuclear scientist, so I can't tell you this is how it worked, this is what the bomb was ... but I can tell you the size that we observed and saw tends to me to indicate that it was a hydrogen bomb and I have to figure out what the right response is with our allies as to that kind of event."" A hydrogen bomb usually uses a primary atomic bomb to trigger a secondary, much larger explosion. Such a weapon, with the first stage based on nuclear fission - splitting atoms - and the second on nuclear fusion, produces a blast that is much more powerful than traditional atomic bombs, or ""pure fission"" devices. :: North Korea: How does H-Bomb compare to atomic bomb?  ""The sheer destruction and damage that you can create with a weapon that size is significantly of a concern,"" Gen Hyten said. However, he said the North still had not demonstrated that it had a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could deliver a nuclear warhead. But he noted it was only a matter of time before its scientists achieved that, given the pace of testing, adding it could be months or years."

The unions, which include the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives and Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, also want staff to be compensated for wage rise restrictions over the past seven years. The UK's three largest trade unions - UNISON, Unite and GMB - backed the demand, which claims Government limits on public sector pay since 2010 have seen NHS workers suffer real terms pay cuts of around 15%. Pressure has already been heaped on Mr Hammond to make a generous offer to public sector workers in the Budget, with Downing Street having confirmed on Tuesday it has scrapped the 1% cap on annual pay rises. The call came as a 2% rise for police and 1.7% wage boost for prison officers was dismissed as not enough by unions, who have threatened strikes over pay. Latest inflation figures released the same day revealed the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) had reached 2.9% in August, with the RPI calculated at 3.9%. Royal College of Nursing chief executive and general secretary Janet Davies said: ""If the Government gives nurses the same deal as the police, it would still be a real terms pay cut. ""When the next pay review body process begins, the Government must allow it to be truly independent and able to recommend a meaningful increase that helps hardworking staff with the cost of living. ""It must be fully-funded and not force the NHS to cut services or jobs to pay for it."" In March, the Government accepted the recommendations of pay review bodies for doctors, dentists and other NHS staff for 2017/18. A Government spokesperson said: ""Public sector workers, including NHS staff, do a fantastic job and the Government is committed to ensuring they can continue to deliver world-class public services. ""The Government will continue to ensure that the overall package is fair while also being affordable to taxpayers as a whole.

2017-09-15,The Liberal Democrats face stiff challenges. The party is no longer the electoral force it was and its claim to be the party of protest is challenged by Labour in most areas and even the Greens in others.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916035100/http://news.sky.com/story/lib-dems-have-work-to-do-to-convince-doubters-the-party-has-a-future-11037013,"At June's General Election that party's vote share fell to under 8%, slipping to a level last seen in 1970. The latest opinion polling evidence suggests that it is becalmed. True, the party did increase its parliamentary seats from eight to twelve, but the peak of 2005 when 62 were elected is a distant memory. The 2017 campaign strategy of becoming the natural home of Remain voters was poorly conceived and executed. Historically, a feature of Lib Dem success is its local government base. But the reversion to two-party politics seen announced at the last General Election was evident across local councils before then. The decline in Lib Dem councillors is dramatic. In the mid-1990s it accounted for one in five councillors. But in 2010 Nick Clegg entered a coalition with David Cameron and the Conservatives. A year later the party lost over 800 council seats. Further losses occurred and with it two-thirds of the councils it controlled. Joining the coalition seriously undermined the party's foundations. This attrition has had a huge impact because its councillors formed its campaigning force. It is hardly surprising that their decline spilled over into elections to devolved institutions in Scotland and Wales. In the 2016 elections, the party was relegated into fifth place in Scotland. In the Assembly of Wales the party is reduced to a solitary representative. Parliamentary and council by-elections normally rejuvenate the Liberal Democrats. In the absence of the former it falls to the local government variant to provide momentum. But this is not happening. Since June the party has shown a net loss of seats and instead it is Labour that makes most of the running in these contests. Instead, the party must await next May's local elections to improve morale. A quarter of its parliamentary seats lie in southwest London and it is in the boroughs of Kingston, Sutton and Richmond where it once held power that it should re-establish its council presence. But gains in parts of England more challenging than this are also necessary to convince doubters the party has a future."

Jeremy Wright QC MP told Sky News: ""There was a murder trial, one of the most serious trials you can contemplate that had to be stopped because of social media commentary that has been happening about the defendants and trial more generally. ""The judge had to stop the trial completely, it had to be moved physically to a different part of the country and the trial begun again."" In another high profile case, the protected identity of one of the murderers of Merseyside toddler James Bulger was revealed on Twitter. The person responsible was given a suspended prison sentence and a hefty fine. The problem is if one post goes viral it can soon be seen by thousands of people, including jurors, and that could prejudice proceedings. Contempt of Court laws were designed to prevent the media unfairly reporting court cases. The trouble is, many social media users are unaware any comments they make online are considered ""publications"" and therefore subject to the same restrictions. Media law barrister Christina Michalos explained: ""If you've got something to say, say it privately, say it behind closed doors to your friends and family, but don't put it on social media because you could be risking the collapse of a criminal trial and the huge public cost which will cost all of us as the taxpayer."" The Attorney General wants to hear from victims groups, solicitors and judges to determine the scale of the problem. Mr Wright added: ""I am looking for expert evidence on whether the increasing influence and ubiquity of social media is having an impact on criminal trials and if so, whether the criminal justice system has the tools it needs to manage that risk.""

Mr McClean, an Oxford University graduate with a first-class degree in French, joined the newspaper as a graduate trainee two years ago and was most recently working for the fastFT news service. The Foreign Office said: ""We are assisting the family of a British man who has been reported missing in Sri Lanka."" Some reports say the victim, believed to be in his 20s, had gone to wash his hands in a lagoon, known both as Crocodile Rock and as Elephant Rock. Fawas Lafeer, former chairman at the Arugam Bay Surf Club, was quoted as saying: ""A local fisherman witnessed a man being dragged into a river, set back from the beach, by a crocodile. ""The fisherman was on the opposite side of the river and downstream of the incident location. The police were called immediately. ""This is the first-known crocodile attack in Sri Lanka. Both tourists and locals surf at Elephant Rock, which is a beautiful secluded beach and very safe. ""Crocodiles in Sri Lanka live only in the fresh, back waters of the jungle. It is almost unheard of for them to come close to the beach. The salt water actually turns them blind. ""Local search and rescue teams are working alongside the police and British Embassy in an attempt to locate the man's body."" A manager at the Star Dust Beach Hotel in Arugam Bay, a town a short distance from Elephant Rock, said the man was trying to take a picture of an elephant when he went into the lagoon and ""was taken by a crocodile"". He said a colleague told him a body had been found but is yet to be identified by police."

Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said: ""At the moment, the threat picture you're looking at is so diffuse, so scattered, so varied and so basic that it becomes very difficult for authorities to stay on top of it entirely.

2017-09-15,The most important music award in the UK has proved its relevance by recognising one of the best emerging artists.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916035100/http://news.sky.com/story/mercury-prize-proves-it-is-still-relevant-just-11036195,"On Thursday night, our biggest fears did not materialise. Ed Sheeran did not win the Mercury Prize, nor did Stormzy. After releasing a sub-par list of nominees in July, the always erratic and never boring ceremony kept true to its roots, and brought to the stage one of the most interesting new artists working in the UK today. For those who applauded the years of Arctic Monkeys, Elbow, The xx or alt-J, Sampha Sisay's winning debut album Process may not be exactly your cup of tea. Its overly vulnerable, borderline Drake-like lyrics can seem a bit too personal in an age where concept albums have left intimacy aside. Life stories are now mostly told by rappers and R&B singers. Sampha is here to change that. And that's what separates him from one of his most undeserved competitors at the Mercurys - Ed Sheeran. :: Mercury Prize 2017: What has changed? Sheeran's guitar-weeping melodies, with a few keywords to appeal to the larger audience, feel like cliches we've heard before. Castle On The Hill's coming of age story of lost love sounds sounds like fake nostalgia. ""Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends,"" Sheeran sings. I shrug. The same applies to Shape Of You, Sheeran's adored single where he talks about ""doing shots"" in a bar with his friends. I look away. But Sampha is of a different calibre. The man who some still remember as the featuring voice of SBTRKT has found his voice, and has put thought and care into his first album. In Blood On Me, the artist describes a gang of faceless ""grey hoodies"" who ""smell blood"" on him - urging the artist to keep moving and creating. Unlike Sheeran, Sampha speaks in careful metaphors, mixing pop, soul and R&B with a little pinch of trip hop. The result is Mercury Prize material. In other songs, he goes deeper, more personal, speaking of his mother who passed away with cancer or his brother who he fails to visit. Sampha is obsessed with family, and brings his first record home with the honesty of an exciting new artist. This year's Mercury Prize saw many great albums in the running. alt-J's Relaxer is nothing short of a master piece, even if it is the band's least-balanced work, and Glass Animals' How To Be A Human Being is a layered, puzzling piece which requires time to dissect. With Sheeran, the jury endangered the continuity of a prize known for taking risks. With Sampha, they proved it still does."

MCS's Beachwatch is the UK's biggest beach clean programme and has been running for over 20 years, but chief exec Sandy Luk says there has been an increase in public interest and engagement over the past year. ""Awareness of the public has really, really picked up because of the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign... and I think more and more people are becoming aware that we are chucking a truck-load of plastic into the sea every minute of the day,"" she said. Plastic pollution affects marine life, eco systems and even human health. Campaigners say if we do nothing by 2050, plastic in the ocean will weigh more than the fish. Unlike other materials, plastic can stay in the environment for thousands of years. But small changes in habits can have a big impact. A charge at supermarket checkouts, has led to a 40% drop in plastic bags found on coastlines. Sky Ocean Rescue is now backing the introduction of deposit return schemes to revolutionise Britain's approach to recycling. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has committed the Scottish Government to the initiative. Plastic makes up 95% of the rubbish in our seas, mainly in the form of bags, food and drink containers, and fishing equipment. From past studies, it is thought that as many as 90% of the world's seabirds have plastic in their stomachs."

2017-09-15,The pound has hit heights against the dollar not seen since its post-Brexit vote bashing after a Bank of England policymaker added his voice to support for an interest rate rise.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916035100/http://news.sky.com/story/pound-at-14-month-high-versus-dollar-on-latest-rate-rise-signal-11036381,"Gertjan Vlieghe said he supported the view, expressed by a majority of the nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) at Thursday's meeting, that rates could rise in the ""coming months"" to help keep a lid on inflation should it continue to grow as expected. In a speech to a conference in London, the economist said: ""There remains a risk that, at some stage, the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process has a larger impact on the economy than we have seen so far. ""If that happens, monetary policy would respond appropriately. ""But for now, it seems the net effect of the many underlying forces acting on the UK economy is that slack iscontinually being eroded and wage pressure is gently building. ""If these data trends of reducing slack, rising pay pressure, strengthening household spending and robust global growth continue, the appropriate time for a rise in Bank Rate might be as early as in the coming months."" It was revealed earlier this week that the annual rate of inflation had hit 2.9% in August - with real wage growth in decline as the latest average increases were static at 2.1%. :: Jobless rate at 42-year low but pay stalls Much of the increase in inflation - and the wage growth apathy - can be explained by uncertainty linked to the Brexit vote. In sterling's case, the pound slumped against a basket of international currencies following the EU referendum result. The consequence of that has been a steep rise in import costs - with those increases being passed on accounting for the leap in consumer prices. Sterling has since recovered some poise - soaring to a high above $1.36 at one stage on Friday, building on gains made after Thursday's MPC meeting. It had crashed from $1.50 to $1.32 immediately after the Brexit result was known in June 2016 - before tumbling further to lows below $1.20. On Friday, it was also higher versus the euro at just over 88p. Sterling's strengthening was reflected on the FTSE 100 as big multi-national earners bled market value. The index was down 1% for a second consecutive day. Market participants saw the currency shift as a realisation that a rate hike was likely, given that inflation is tipped to hit 3% before next year. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""This does not mean the start of a tightening cycle as we understand them necessarily, but at least a 'correction' to the Bank's cut last August. ""Indeed with sterling now back to more sensible levels it will no doubt raise debate again about whether the Bank should have cut rates given that the collapse in sterling is what's driving inflation."""

Jurors are having to decide whether Weier was mentally ill at the time of the attack at a park in the city of Waukesha, when all three girls were aged 12. Doctors said Payton Leutner almost died in the attack. The young victim managed to crawl out of the park where a passing cyclist found her. Weier, now 15, and Morgan Geyser told police they were trying to become servants of Slender Man and had to kill Miss Leutner. Both girls have pleaded not guilty on grounds of mental illness. Geyser's trial is due to start next month. Mr Van Rybroek's expert testimony matched that of another psychologist who said Weier and Geyser had a shared delusion about Slender Man. Mr Van Rybroek said as a result Weier ""couldn't stop herself at the moment it mattered most,"" and helped stab Miss Leutner even though she knew it was wrong. He told the court that adolescents could experience delayed development of judgement and impulse control. He said: ""They have really good accelerators but not very good brakes."" Prosecutors argue Weier knew what she was doing was wrong, but went along with the attack to keep her friendship with Geyser. The trial continues."

To have marshalled enough parliamentary discipline to avoid any Conservative or DUP rebellion - while also seeing seven Labour MPs join them in the voting lobbies - will be savoured as a victory for Theresa May, not least on a matter as traditionally divisive for her party as Europe. But her acknowledgement on Tuesday morning that ""there is more to do"" is a significant understatement. Numerous Conservative MPs have expressed deep concern about the anti-democratic impact of the bill in its current form, and have made it abundantly clear there is a price to pay for their midnight support. As dawn broke, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also gave signals the Government understood the terms, telling Sky News it was right that Parliament look into the detail of the bill, insisting ministers would be ""listening"". On the Conservative benches, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, former business minister Anna Soubry and former chancellor Ken Clarke were among those who chose not to pull the trigger on a rebellion on Monday night. However, the gun is still loaded and if serious changes are not made as MPs in committees dissect the bill line by line, it may yet be used. Indeed, up to 12 Tory MPs are believed to already be backing amendments tabled for consideration by committee. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has also made clear he intends to make the committee stage of the bill as testing for the Government as possible, despite the divisions within his own party that Monday night's vote exposed. Labour's amendments have already been tabled - focused on watering down the executive powers given to ministers to make law with limited parliamentary scrutiny, securing protections on human rights and environmental standards, and ensuring devolved powers remain devolved. But Sir Keir is also suggesting the bill may be already beyond repair - arguing the Prime Minister should have dropped it and started again, rather than burdening Parliament with the task of mangling the current form into something more acceptable to those who opposed its second reading. ""This is likely to cause delays and division in Parliament, and the Prime Minister has nobody to blame but herself,"" SIr Keir said. However, when it comes to the other opposition parties, it is not just the Government but Labour they hold in contempt. The Liberal Democrats accused Labour rebels of handing the government victory, while Plaid Cymru said Labour's lack of unity risked ""letting the Tories off the hook"". But Labour rebels seem far less likely at another crucial Commons vote due to be held once more in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Government is seeking to grant itself a majority on the selection committee - the body which chooses the make-up of MPs on the standing committees that scrutinise legislation - another step which the opposition parties have labelled a ""power grab"". The controversy lies in the fact that the Conservatives have no outright majority and therefore, critics say, the balance should be equally split between Labour and the Tories. Not so, argue the Government - pointing to the fact they have a majority on the floor of the House with DUP support that will see the motion pass, and therefore a majority on the selection committee is warranted to avoid logjams in the business of legislating. The critical question will be whether any so-called ""constitutionalists"" on the Tory benches, who grudgingly nodded the EU Withdrawal Bill to its next stage, feel this is a step too far."

At 12.56pm UK time, radio contact with the 22ft-long nuclear-powered probe was lost as it tumbled to its demise 930 miles above the cloud tops of the planet. :: The legacy of doomed NASA spacecraft Cassini It disintegrated into fragments and burned up in seconds as it plummeted at 77,000mph. Mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, clapped and hugged one another when the loss of signal was confirmed. Project manager Earl Maize said: ""Congratulations to you all. This has been an incredible mission ... you're all an incredible team."" The decision to end the mission was made because the probe would soon run out of fuel and become impossible to steer. Scientists feared the craft would collide with Titan or Enceladus, two of Saturn's moons, that have in the past 10 years shown a potential to host life. The safe disposal of Cassini was viewed as the best way of avoiding the remote possibility of contaminating the pristine moons with Earth bugs. It took seven years to reach Saturn after launching from Cape Canaveral in Florida in 1997 and the original intention was for it to explore the planet and its moons for just three years. The mission is regarded as one of the most ambitious and successful ever undertaken. One of Cassini's most important discoveries was the existence of a global watery ocean under the icy surface of Enceladus that could conceivably host life. A European Space Agency probe carried by the orbiter, called Huygens, made worldwide headlines when it landed on Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons, in January 2005. The two probes showed Titan has a startlingly Earth-like landscape, with rivers, lakes and seas filled with liquid methane and ethane. Cassini also discovered seven new moons, six of which have been named, observed raging storms on Saturn, and revealed more details of the planet's famous rings. Its fate was sealed on 11 September when it was sent on a final fly-by of Titan, which is 760,000 miles from Saturn. Titan's gravity nudged it onto a course back to Saturn, something the scientists involved in the mission nicknamed the ""goodbye kiss"". Cassini was still sending data back to Earth in near-real time right up until radio contact was lost."

Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said: ""At the moment, the threat picture you're looking at is so diffuse, so scattered, so varied and so basic that it becomes very difficult for authorities to stay on top of it entirely.

2017-09-16,"The pound may have been the worst performing major currency of recent times, but during the last three months it has been on an absolute tear.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916200221/http://news.sky.com/story/a-rate-rise-conundrum-despite-sterling-surge-against-dollar-11036647,"Having traded as low as $1.2587 as recently as 21 June, it hit $1.3615 earlier on Friday, a gain of 8%. The pound is now trading against the greenback at levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU in June last year. That may not sound like much, given that the pound was trading at $1.50 before news of the Leave vote came through, but it does represent a significant recovery given that, around the time of the 'flash crash' on 7 October last year, some wild-eyed souls in the currency markets were talking seriously about the pound going all the way to $1.05. Against the euro, the gains have been less dramatic, reflecting the single currency's status as the best-performing major currency this year. Sterling's recent rally has merely brought it back to levels seen in mid-July. However, given that it was not that long ago that some people were speculating the pound might hit parity against the euro, it still represents a solid recovery. No one is talking any more about one pound being equal in value to one euro, at least, not outside the price-gouging currency exchange units at one or two UK airports. The reason for this rally, of course, is that the market is starting to price in an interest rate rise. A series of events have given this sentiment impetus, including news on Tuesday this week that consumer price inflation had hit 2.9% and Wednesday's news of another drop in the jobless rate to just 4.3%. This was followed on Thursday by minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee that revealed a majority of members believe that, in the absence of bad news, ""some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months"". That was reinforced in a speech on Friday by Gertjan Vlieghe, previously seen as one of the 'doves' on the MPC, in which he said ""the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when Bank rate may need to rise"". Mr Vlieghe added that this ""may be as early as the coming months"". These developments raise two questions. The first is the extent to which Bank Rate may have to increase. There is a school of thought in the market that the UK economy, in spite of the robust job creation figures, is losing momentum and may continue to do so while uncertainty persists over the Brexit deal that the UK is going to strike with the EU. That is certainly believed to be the view of Mark Carney, the Bank's governor. If shared by most other members of the MPC, it could mean monetary policy could merely be tightened to the extent of reversing last year's emergency rate cut made by the Bank following the Leave vote, bringing Bank rate back to 0.5%. This view, summed up in the phrase 'one and done', has it that the UK economy faces several years of uncertainty and that household finances are still quite fragile. The jobless rate may be falling but earnings growth is not keeping pace with inflation. Some UK households, it is argued, might struggle to meet their mortgage repayments even if there is a modest rate rise. Yet there is also a case for going further. Inflation is well ahead of the Bank's central target of 2%, unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and the UK economy is set to grow this year at around 1.7% which, while low, is not wildly out of kilter with the growth rates seen since the global financial crisis. Add to that the fact that the UK stock market is now into the eighth year of its current bull run and, on Wall Street, the rally has been going on longer than that. We are due another big stock market reversal together with the hit to confidence that would involve. Raising rates further now, it can be argued, will give the Bank scope to cut them again if it needs to rebuild confidence in the future. The other question is whether the MPC can be believed when it makes hawkish noises of the kind it has been this week. Mr Carney has, in the past, dropped heavy hints that interest rate rises are on the way - most famously at a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 and at Lincoln Cathedral in 2015 - only for him not to follow through with them. This led Labour MP Pat McFadden, then a member of the Treasury Select Committee, to dub him the ""unreliable boyfriend"". There are, however, alternatives to raising interest rates. One would be to start unwinding the Bank's £435bn worth of asset purchases undertaken since the financial crisis - Quantitative Easing in the jargon - which would have a similar impact to raising longer-term interest rates. Another would be to call a halt to the Term Funding Scheme, part of the stimulus package that was introduced after the Brexit vote, which aimed to ensure that banks passed on the full extent of the emergency rate cut. There is a view that all the scheme has done is fatten the profits of the banks and helped pump up another bubble in consumer borrowing - something about which the Bank itself has been worrying. A final measure that could be taken to stop consumer borrowing expanding dangerously could be taken by the Treasury, rather than the Bank, which would be to end the Help to Buy scheme. All the evidence suggests that this measure, introduced by the former Chancellor George Osborne in the hope of winning a few votes from would-be homeowners, has merely boosted the profitability of the housebuilders by stimulating demand for homes without doing anything to encourage building more of them."

The Foreign Office said: ""We are assisting the family of a British man who has been reported missing in Sri Lanka."" Some reports say the victim, believed to be in his 20s, had gone to wash his hands in a lagoon, known both as Crocodile Rock and as Elephant Rock. Fawas Lafeer, former chairman at the Arugam Bay Surf Club, was quoted as saying: ""A local fisherman witnessed a man being dragged into a river, set back from the beach, by a crocodile. ""The fisherman was on the opposite side of the river and downstream of the incident location. The police were called immediately. ""This is the first-known crocodile attack in Sri Lanka. Both tourists and locals surf at Elephant Rock, which is a beautiful secluded beach and very safe. ""Crocodiles in Sri Lanka live only in the fresh, back waters of the jungle.

A manager at the Star Dust Beach Hotel in Arugam Bay, a town a short distance from Elephant Rock, said the man was trying to take a picture of an elephant when he went into the lagoon and ""was taken by a crocodile"".

Riot police used pepper spray to disperse the crowds. Trouble flared after a judge acquitted Jason Stockley of first-degree murder for killing Anthony Lamar Smith. The 36-year-old was arrested in May 2016 and accused of planting a gun in Smith's car, but he said he had acted in self-defence. After the verdict, the protesters chanted ""no justice, no peace"" and ""shut it down"", while some held Black Lives Matter signs. Reverend Clinton Stancil of the Wayman AME Church in St Louis, said: ""I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad. We haven't made any progress since Ferguson, that's clear. Cops can still kill us with impunity."" Mayor Lyda Krewson and Governor Eric Greitens, who put the National Guard on standby, appealed for calm as schools and businesses in the area closed early. In a statement, the mayor said: ""Frustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all intermingle. I encourage St Louisans to show each other compassion."" Al Watkins, an attorney for Smith's fiancee, Christina Wilson, said his client was appalled by the decision. He said the ruling showed prejudice, pointing to a line where the judge wrote that an ""urban heroin dealer"" without a weapon would be an anomaly. Judge Timothy Wilson's ruling was announced more than five weeks after the bench trial ended. He wrote in his ruling: ""This court, as a trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant's guilt."" Prosecutors also asked the court to consider a lesser degree of homicide, but they were unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Stockley's use of deadly force was not justified in self-defence. Stockley's attorney was not available for comment."

According to reports, Mr McClean was holidaying in Sri Lanka with friends and authorities believe he was dragged away by a crocodile after he stepped into the lagoon about 220 miles east of the capital Colombo. The post-mortem examination found he drowned after being bitten on his right leg, but it did not confirm if it was a crocodile that grabbed him, said a police official who saw the report. The official added: ""There were six teeth marks of an animal on his right leg. There was no specific mention of a crocodile attack because the JMO (judicial medical officer) could not verify it immediately."" Magistrate Mohamed Hilmy, who visited the coastal village on Friday, ordered an inquest to be held on Monday. The FT's managing editor James Lamont described him as ""a talented, energetic and dedicated young journalist"". He said: ""Our thoughts are with his family, friends and loved ones. We are in touch with them, doing all we can to help during this difficult time."" Margaritis Schinas, spokesman for European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, said Mr McClean, who had also worked in Brussels for the FT, was ""well known and well liked"". He added: ""He was an extremely talented and dedicated young journalist. He had an exceptional eye for detail and never shied away from difficult stories. ""But above all, Paul was a gentleman and an absolute pleasure to work with. He will be fondly remembered and greatly missed by all in the spokespersons' service and in the wider Brussels community."" Although crocodile attacks are rare in Sri Lanka, earlier this month wildlife authorities reported that a crocodile had seriously injured a wild elephant in the south of the island. During monsoon floods in May, authorities warned people in inundated areas to be aware of stray crocodiles."

2017-09-16,The Liberal Democrats face stiff challenges. The party is no longer the electoral force it was and its claim to be the party of protest is challenged by Labour in most areas and even the Greens in others.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916200221/http://news.sky.com/story/lib-dems-have-work-to-do-to-convince-doubters-the-party-has-a-future-11037013,"At June's General Election that party's vote share fell to under 8%, slipping to a level last seen in 1970. The latest opinion polling evidence suggests that it is becalmed. True, the party did increase its parliamentary seats from eight to twelve, but the peak of 2005 when 62 were elected is a distant memory. The 2017 campaign strategy of becoming the natural home of Remain voters was poorly conceived and executed. Historically, a feature of Lib Dem success is its local government base. But the reversion to two-party politics seen announced at the last General Election was evident across local councils before then. The decline in Lib Dem councillors is dramatic. In the mid-1990s it accounted for one in five councillors. But in 2010 Nick Clegg entered a coalition with David Cameron and the Conservatives. A year later the party lost over 800 council seats. Further losses occurred and with it two-thirds of the councils it controlled. Joining the coalition seriously undermined the party's foundations. This attrition has had a huge impact because its councillors formed its campaigning force. It is hardly surprising that their decline spilled over into elections to devolved institutions in Scotland and Wales. In the 2016 elections, the party was relegated into fifth place in Scotland. In the Assembly of Wales the party is reduced to a solitary representative. Parliamentary and council by-elections normally rejuvenate the Liberal Democrats. In the absence of the former it falls to the local government variant to provide momentum. But this is not happening. Since June the party has shown a net loss of seats and instead it is Labour that makes most of the running in these contests. Instead, the party must await next May's local elections to improve morale. A quarter of its parliamentary seats lie in southwest London and it is in the boroughs of Kingston, Sutton and Richmond where it once held power that it should re-establish its council presence. But gains in parts of England more challenging than this are also necessary to convince doubters the party has a future."

Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said that officers had to partially evacuate the port of Dover after a manhunt led them to arresting an 18-year-old who was in the departure area. A precautionary search of the area following the ""significant"" arrest turned up ""a number of items"" said Mr Basu. The 18-year-old was arrested ""on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism"". At the time, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd described the arrest of the man in connection with Friday morning's attack as ""very significant"", but added ""the operation is ongoing"". Police are keeping ""an open mind"" as to whether more than one person was involved in the attack and are working to ""identify and locate other suspects"", said Mr Basu. ""We are still pursuing numerous lines of enquiry, and at great pace,"" he added. Police were searching a property in Surrey into Saturday night that police described as directly linked to the arrest in Dover. The property is registered to an elderly foster couple who had been honoured for their work with child refugees. Ronald Jones, 88, and his 71-year-old wife Penelope, were awarded MBEs in the 2009 New Year's Honours List for services to children and families. No further arrests have been made. The street has been evacuated as a precautionary measure. Mr Basu said that the police are ""working to support displaced residents"". Thirty people were injured in the terror attack, Mr Basu confirmed. Of those injured, 19 victims were taken to hospital by ambulance, while 11 presented themselves for treatment. Three people remain in hospital Mr Basu said the police were ""incredibly grateful no one was killed"". The UK's terror threat level was raised to critical - the highest level - late on Friday, meaning another attack is expected imminently. :: Analysis: Scale of anti-terror probes 'unprecedented' Mr Basu said the public should ""remain vigilant"", and added the extra security measures put in place in the wake of the blast will remain in force. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said: ""London has not stopped after other terrible attacks and it will not stop after this one."" London mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""The police investigation is ongoing and there will still be significant activity today and over the days ahead. :: How the UK's terror threat levels work ""I am sure I speak for London when I say we are incredibly grateful to the police and intelligence services for doing everything possible to keep Londoners safe."" Although police have described the arrest as significant, the Met later added they would not be releasing where the suspect is from, whether he is the suspected bomber or the precise details of the offence for which he has been arrested. Mr Basu said that police had identified 121 witnesses so far, and has spoken to 100 of them already. ""Officers continue to trawl through many hours of closed circuit television footage and more than 180 videos and pictures that have been sent to them by the public. ""We continue to take large numbers of calls from the public via the confidential Anti Terrorist Hotline. ""The public's help remains crucial, and I urge anyone with information, no matter how significant they think it is, to continue letting us know."" The Met has renewed its appeal for information, asking anyone with information to call the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789 321 or 999 in an emergency."

MCS's Beachwatch is the UK's biggest beach clean programme and has been running for over 20 years, but chief exec Sandy Luk says there has been an increase in public interest and engagement over the past year. ""Awareness of the public has really, really picked up because of the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign... and I think more and more people are becoming aware that we are chucking a truck-load of plastic into the sea every minute of the day,"" she said. Plastic pollution affects marine life, eco systems and even human health. Campaigners say if we do nothing by 2050, plastic in the ocean will weigh more than the fish. Unlike other materials, plastic can stay in the environment for thousands of years. But small changes in habits can have a big impact. A charge at supermarket checkouts, has led to a 40% drop in plastic bags found on coastlines. Sky Ocean Rescue is now backing the introduction of deposit return schemes to revolutionise Britain's approach to recycling. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has committed the Scottish Government to the initiative. Plastic makes up 95% of the rubbish in our seas, mainly in the form of bags, food and drink containers, and fishing equipment. From past studies, it is thought that as many as 90% of the world's seabirds have plastic in their stomachs."

While most victims suffered flash burns, others are said to have been hurt in the ensuing panic as people fled the station screaming and in tears. A number of hospitals declared a major incident with staff on standby. None of the injuries are said to be life threatening. :: Live updates - Injuries reported in 'explosion' Armed police and counter-terror officers rushed to the scene, which has been cordoned off while forensics teams comb the area for clues. The security service MI5 is assisting the investigation and a major manhunt is under way for the bomber. Britain's top counter-terror chief Mark Rowley said said the explosion was caused by the ""detonation of an improvised explosive device"". Images emerged showing a large white bucket in flames on the floor of the train carriage inside a Lidl bag with wires hanging from it. :: 10 facts we know about Parsons Green bomb Tube passenger Chris Wildish said he saw flames coming from the device which had ""a strong smell of chemicals"". Security services confirmed to Sky News that they believe there was a timer attached to the bomb. ""Meaning, of course, that whoever it was who placed this bomb on the carriage floor would not have been present at the time,"" said Sky's Home Affairs Correspondent Mark White. He added: ""That is important. If there's a timer with this device it will give them an indication that perhaps the suspect didn't disembark the train with other panicked passengers at Parsons Green. ""They'll be looking at the stations before Parsons Green to determine whether an individual left the train at that point."" :: 'Fireball flew down carriage and we jumped out' The blast comes as Britain remains on high alert following a series of terror attacks in Westminster, London Bridge and Finsbury Park this year. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan appealed for calm and vowed London ""will never be intimidated or defeated by terrorism"". Prime Minister Theresa May was ""receiving regular updates"" on the situation as she held a meeting of the Government's emergency COBRA committee. She condemned the attack as ""cowardly"" and said the threat level would remain at ""severe"".

Schoolchildren could be seen being evacuated from one of two trains at the station following the incident. Tube services on the District Line between Earls Court and Wimbledon were suspended. Witness Luke Walmsley said people suffered hand, foot and head injuries in ""the stampede"" that followed the blast. He told Sky News: ""It was sort of every man for himself when that happened. The burn victims had severe leg injuries and no sign of clothing, it was just torn through. ""It was a very busy commuter train, young and old, schoolchildren going to their schools."""

The article has fuelled speculation about Mr Johnson's leadership ambitions, but he insisted he was ""all behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit"" and ""looking forward"" to the Prime Minister's upcoming Brexit speech in Italy next week. The Leave campaign's most prominent pledge in the run up to the 2016 referendum was that the NHS would benefit from £350m per week that the UK would have if it were to end its EU contributions. :: Analysis: What is Boris Johnson playing at? Looking forward to PM's Florence speech. All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit: https://t.co/5pe1pY2m13 The pledge was mocked by the Remain campaign, who accused Leave of making bogus claims and misleading the public. The controversial claim even led Leave campaigner Dr Sarah Wollaston to defect to the Remain camp, saying Leave had ""knowingly placed a financial lie at the heart of their campaign"". However, Mr Johnson stuck by the claim as he set out the benefits he believes the UK will enjoy once it breaks away from the bloc. :: Theresa May to deliver major Brexit speech in Florence next week He said: ""And yes - once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly £350 million per week. It would be a fine thing as many of us have pointed out if a lot of that money went on the NHS, provided we use that cash injection to modernise and make the most of new technology. ""The NHS is one of the great unifying institutions of our country. It is the top political priority of the British people and, under the leadership of Jeremy Hunt, it is indeed the top priority of the Conservative party. ""Coming out of the EU will give us an opportunity to drive that message home."" The Foreign Secretary also wrote about opportunities for the UK once it takes control if its cash, borders and laws. :: Brexit Secretary: EU divorce bill now '£60bn and falling' ""At the stroke of a pen, the Chancellor will be able to cut VAT on tampons; often demanded by Parliament but - absurdly - legally impossible to deliver,"" he said. Mr Johnson added: ""We will have an immigration policy that suits the UK, not slamming the door but welcoming the talent we need, from the EU and around the world."" A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the intervention had ""laid bare the conflicts at the heart of Theresa May's Government"". ""In the process he has exposed the Tories' real Brexit agenda - a race to the bottom in regulation and corporate tax cuts to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the rights of the rest of us,"" he said. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the PM must ""slap down"" her Foreign Secretary, who he described as a ""Poundland Donald Trump""."

2017-09-16,Voters in five areas of England will be required to show ID for the first time as part of efforts to combat electoral fraud.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916200221/http://news.sky.com/story/voter-id-pilots-planned-in-five-areas-for-2018-elections-to-combat-fraud-11037750,"Pilots will take place for local elections in Woking, Gosport, Bromley, Watford and Slough in May 2018, with photo and non-photo forms of identification being trialled in different areas to see which is the most effective and efficient. A separate pilot looking at the security of postal votes will also be held in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets. If the trial is successful it could be extended across the country. The Electoral Commission recommended in 2014 that voters should be required to prove their identities before they can cast a ballot. There were 44 instances in 2016 elections of people trying to use another individual's vote, known as ""personation"", compared with 21 in 2014. Northern Ireland voters have had to prove their identity when voting since 1985, with photo ID made a requirement in 2003. Since then there have been no cases of personation in the province. Constitution minister Chris Skidmore said: ""The current situation of people simply pointing out their name without having to prove who they are feels out of date when considering other safeguards to protect people's identity. ""It is harder to take out a library book or collect a parcel at a post office than it is to vote in someone's name. ""I am very hopeful that by taking a careful, evidence-based approach in these pilots we will be able to roll out ID in polling stations at future elections."" A report from the former communities secretary Sir Eric Pickles last year said the current system was unsatisfactory and called on the Government to consider options such as requiring voters to show their driving licence, passport or utility bills. Electoral Commission chief executive Claire Bassett said: ""We welcome the minister's announcement today as a positive first step towards implementing our 2014 recommendation that an accessible, proportionate voter identification scheme should be introduced in Great Britain. ""Voters in Northern Ireland have been required to show photographic proof of identity since 2003, and we have the opportunity to learn from that experience."" But both Labour and the Liberal Democrats voiced fears the move could harm turnout. Cat Smith, Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, said there was ""no evidence that this particular type of fraud is widespread"". She said: ""Introducing restrictive ID requirements risks making it harder for people to vote, reducing turnout and excluding some parts of the electorate, all while doing little to stop determined fraudsters."" Liberal Democrat Tom Brake said: ""Introducing voter ID at polling booths is a solution to a problem that is almost non-existent in the UK. ""This is a completely unnecessary move that risks undermining our democracy by preventing millions of people from voting."""

Oct 4."" Answers are coming. October 4. pic.twitter.com/3CQrBcwi47 It will be exactly 12 months since the original Pixel was announced. At the time, it was marketed as Google's first own-built phone, which had virtual helper Google Assistant at its centre. Reports are now naming Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL as the likely new devices to be unveiled. The event follows Apple's latest live event earlier this week, when it introduced three new iPhone handsets, including the £999 iPhone X, which marked the 10th anniversary of the phone's original launch. Critics warmly received the original Google Pixel in 2016 - and according to some reports, notable upgrades to this year's device will include the addition of optical image stabilisation (OIS) to the rear camera for the first time to reduce the number of blurred photos being snapped. It completes a busy period for smartphone announcements with Samsung, LG and Sony having all introduced new devices in September."
2017-09-16,It was at 6.42am in Washington that Donald Trump tweeted himself into another diplomatic row with the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916200221/http://news.sky.com/story/trump-scolded-by-police-and-pm-for-unhelpful-tweets-after-london-attack-11037017,"His assertion that the London attackers ""were in the sights of Scotland Yard"" was either the revelation of shared intelligence or what the Prime Minister called unhelpful speculation. Either way, it has done some damage to that much vaunted ""special relationship"" - and Sky News understands that Theresa May raised Mr Trump's tweets in a phone call with the President on Friday afternoon. :: Live updates - Tube terror blast Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive! Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better! Earlier, in Downing Street, Mrs May had said: ""I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation."" The Metropolitan Police echoed the Prime Minister's concerns, as Mr Trump's comments did not correspond with any information released by the UK authorities. Mr Trump offered little clarity during an appearance in the sunshine of the Rose Garden a few hours later. Although he confirmed he had been briefed on London, the President did not say whether that briefing happened before or after his tweets. :: Witness - 'Fireball flew through carriage' The whole event was a little surreal: the President had gone outside to watch an 11-year-old called Frankie Giaccio mow the lawn (Frankie had written to the White House asking if he could) and ended up talking international affairs. So, as Frankie's mower roared into life, Mr Trump turned and strode to the Oval Office to - he said - place a call to Theresa May... and perhaps try to repair some of that damage. A Downing Street spokesperson later confirmed a conversation had taken place, saying: ""President Trump called the Prime Minister earlier today to offer his condolences over this morning's cowardly attack in London."" And the White House said Mr Trump had pledged close collaboration with the UK ""to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism"". The President has form with London attacks. He and his son Donald Trump Jr both mocked Sadiq Khan after taking the mayor's words of reassurance to Londoners out of context. That happened after the Westminster Bridge and Borough Market attacks. :: What we know about Parsons Green attack After the Manchester Arena attack, intelligence from the UK investigation - including the name of the attacker and photos of his device - was leaked by US government sources to the American media. Mr Trump wasn't responsible, of course, but US secretary of state Rex Tillerson was dispatched to London to head off a full-blown diplomatic row after intelligence sharing was briefly suspended. The President did share highly classified intelligence about suspected IS plans, until then closely guarded among US allies, with the Russian foreign minister during a meeting at the White House. He later said he had an ""absolute right"" to do so but it prompted criticism that he was careless in exposing intelligence gatherers to increased risk. :: Timeline of UK terror attacks in 2017 His tweets about the London attack will attract similar accusations of carelessness. If Mr Trump had insight into the UK investigation, should he have publicly shared it? Was he criticising Scotland Yard and the British intelligence services for not acting sooner? His tweets tend to be aimed at his base, bolstering his image as tough on immigration and terrorism and with little thought to the wider world. A rebuke from his friend, the British Prime Minister, should remind him of the damage they can also do."
2017-09-16,"The Prime Minister said the decision was ""historic"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170916200221/http://news.sky.com/story/parliament-supports-eu-withdrawal-bill-but-threat-of-brexit-rebellion-remains-11031615,"But it seems clear she also knows Parliament's approval for the EU Withdrawal Bill to proceed to its next stage was unmistakably conditional. To have marshalled enough parliamentary discipline to avoid any Conservative or DUP rebellion - while also seeing seven Labour MPs join them in the voting lobbies - will be savoured as a victory for Theresa May, not least on a matter as traditionally divisive for her party as Europe. But her acknowledgement on Tuesday morning that ""there is more to do"" is a significant understatement. Numerous Conservative MPs have expressed deep concern about the anti-democratic impact of the bill in its current form, and have made it abundantly clear there is a price to pay for their midnight support. As dawn broke, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also gave signals the Government understood the terms, telling Sky News it was right that Parliament look into the detail of the bill, insisting ministers would be ""listening"". On the Conservative benches, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, former business minister Anna Soubry and former chancellor Ken Clarke were among those who chose not to pull the trigger on a rebellion on Monday night. However, the gun is still loaded and if serious changes are not made as MPs in committees dissect the bill line by line, it may yet be used. Indeed, up to 12 Tory MPs are believed to already be backing amendments tabled for consideration by committee. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has also made clear he intends to make the committee stage of the bill as testing for the Government as possible, despite the divisions within his own party that Monday night's vote exposed. Labour's amendments have already been tabled - focused on watering down the executive powers given to ministers to make law with limited parliamentary scrutiny, securing protections on human rights and environmental standards, and ensuring devolved powers remain devolved. But Sir Keir is also suggesting the bill may be already beyond repair - arguing the Prime Minister should have dropped it and started again, rather than burdening Parliament with the task of mangling the current form into something more acceptable to those who opposed its second reading. ""This is likely to cause delays and division in Parliament, and the Prime Minister has nobody to blame but herself,"" SIr Keir said. However, when it comes to the other opposition parties, it is not just the Government but Labour they hold in contempt. The Liberal Democrats accused Labour rebels of handing the government victory, while Plaid Cymru said Labour's lack of unity risked ""letting the Tories off the hook"". But Labour rebels seem far less likely at another crucial Commons vote due to be held once more in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Government is seeking to grant itself a majority on the selection committee - the body which chooses the make-up of MPs on the standing committees that scrutinise legislation - another step which the opposition parties have labelled a ""power grab"". The controversy lies in the fact that the Conservatives have no outright majority and therefore, critics say, the balance should be equally split between Labour and the Tories. Not so, argue the Government - pointing to the fact they have a majority on the floor of the House with DUP support that will see the motion pass, and therefore a majority on the selection committee is warranted to avoid logjams in the business of legislating. The critical question will be whether any so-called ""constitutionalists"" on the Tory benches, who grudgingly nodded the EU Withdrawal Bill to its next stage, feel this is a step too far."

2017-09-17,Thousands of volunteers will take part in over 300 beach cleans across the UK this weekend.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170918045845/http://news.sky.com/story/big-coastal-clean-up-to-rid-uk-beaches-of-plastic-rubbish-11037698,"The annual event by the Marine Conservation Society will help collect data on litter levels, with plastics debris by far the most common item found. MCS's Beachwatch is the UK's biggest beach clean programme and has been running for over 20 years, but chief exec Sandy Luk says there has been an increase in public interest and engagement over the past year. ""Awareness of the public has really, really picked up because of the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign... and I think more and more people are becoming aware that we are chucking a truck-load of plastic into the sea every minute of the day,"" she said. Plastic pollution affects marine life, eco systems and even human health. Campaigners say if we do nothing by 2050, plastic in the ocean will weigh more than the fish. Unlike other materials, plastic can stay in the environment for thousands of years. But small changes in habits can have a big impact. A charge at supermarket checkouts, has led to a 40% drop in plastic bags found on coastlines. Sky Ocean Rescue is now backing the introduction of deposit return schemes to revolutionise Britain's approach to recycling. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has committed the Scottish Government to the initiative. Plastic makes up 95% of the rubbish in our seas, mainly in the form of bags, food and drink containers, and fishing equipment. From past studies, it is thought that as many as 90% of the world's seabirds have plastic in their stomachs."
2017-09-17,"Security links between Britain and the European Union should be secured with a new legal pact, says the Home Secretary.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170918045845/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-proposes-eu-treaty-to-protect-security-ties-11039850,"Amber Rudd says current security arrangements including membership of Europol and the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) ""will end"" after Brexit. But days after Britain was hit by a terrorist attack at Parson's Green station, the UK is preparing to present proposals for a new treaty to give legal backing to intelligence, law enforcement and criminal justice partnerships post Brexit. Writing in The Sun on Sunday, Amber Rudd praises existing arrangements within the EU as ""some of the world's most sophisticated cross-border systems in the fight against crime"". The Home Secretary makes reference to the success of the EAW and Europol but goes on to say: ""When we leave the EU, these current arrangements will end, but our partnership must go on for the security of the UK and the continent."" She adds: ""Tomorrow, the Government will publish a paper outlining how we want to achieve this. It will suggest that the fight against crime and terror could be underpinned by a new security treaty between the UK and the EU. ""A new treaty would allow us to maintain and strengthen our current level of cooperation and provide a new legal framework to do this."" David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, also backs the plan. He will say in a future partnership paper, due out on on Monday, that a new security deal is vital. Mr Davis will say: ""Effective international cooperation is absolutely crucial for both the UK and the EU if we are to keep our citizens safe and bring criminals to justice. ""We already have a deep level of collaboration with the EU on security matters and it is in both our interests to find ways to maintain it. ""We approach negotiations on our future special partnership with the EU as an opportunity to build on our existing achievements."" In the past, both the EU and the UK have accused each other of using intelligence services as leverage in negotiations. In March, the Home Secretary stated it was ""likely"" the UK would leave Europol in the wake of Brexit unless a deal is made. Last month, EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier also warned that Britain would be forced to leave Europol and that the EU-UK split would weaken British security and counter-terrorism. And Theresa May linked failure to strike a trade deal with a reduction of intelligence sharing in her Article 50 letter in March. She wrote: ""In security terms, a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened."""

A woman and two children are in hospital in a life-threatening condition, police said. Huge queues built up behind the crash scene after the motorway was closed in both directions. Avon and Somerset Police said: ""The closure is likely to be in place for a considerable amount of time and we'd ask people to avoid the area."" Pictures from the scene showed a truck on an embankment, with the rear of the lorry sticking up in the air. It was surrounded by emergency vehicles at the scene. Motorists have been advised to follow diversions.

The search at the well-respected couple's house in Cavendish Road in Sunbury-on-Thames follows the ""very significant arrest"" of an 18-year-old in Dover. The teenager is the is now being held at a London police station. A second man, aged 21, was also arrested in Hounslow on Sunday. In the operation by armed police in Surrey, Cavendish Road was evacuated as a precautionary measure. Local resident Nicola Ryder described Mr and Mrs Jones as ""beautiful people"". She said she knew them as Penny and Ron, and that they would foster up to seven young people at a time. The couple are believed to have been foster parents for almost 40 years and had taken in 268 children. Cordons have been set up at a 100-metre radius from the Sunbury property which will remain in place until the search has been completed. After the evacuation, residents of Cavendish Road went to a local rugby club and some were taken by bus to a community centre in Shepperton. They were allowed to return to their homes later on Saturday night. Mojgan Jamali, 33, who lives in Cavendish Road, said she was given ""one minute"" by police to pack her bags, grab her children and leave her home. ""I was in my house with my children and there was a knock at the door from the police. ""They told me to leave,"" said Mrs Jamali. ""They said: 'You have one minute to get out of the house and get away.' ""I just got out, I got my three children and we left the house and the street.'""

The majority have been allowed back into their homes now, but some remain displaced by the police investigation. :: Analysis: Scale of anti-terror probes 'unprecedented' The Home Secretary Amber Rudd described the earlier arrest of an 18-year-old man in connection with Friday morning's attack as ""very significant"", but added ""the operation is ongoing"". Thirty people were injured in the explosion during the Friday morning rush hour as the District Line train was pulling into the west London station of Parsons Green. Of those injured, 19 victims were taken to hospital by ambulance, while 11 presented themselves for treatment. All but one have now been released from hospital. The attack sparked a huge manhunt for a potential network of plotters, with the country's top counter-terrorism officer suggesting more than one suspect could have been involved. The UK's terror threat level was raised to critical - the highest level - late on Friday, meaning another attack is expected imminently. :: How the UK's terror threat levels work Mrs Rudd said that the threat level will remain at critical, and that it was ""good fortune"" that the bomb did ""so little damage"". She added it was ""too early"" to say whether those responsible for the Parsons Green bombing were known to the authorities. ""We will have to make sure to take all steps that we can to ensure the sort of materials that this man was able to collect become more and more difficult to combine together. ""We will always learn from these sort of incidents."""

The level had been raised on Friday to the highest - critical - following the bucket bomb blast at Parsons Green Tube station that left 30 passengers injured. Troops were deployed to key locations so armed police were freed up to patrol the streets. Two people have been arrested in connection with the west London bombing, and Ms Rudd has announced the UK threat level was being downgraded. ""I would urge everybody to continue to be vigilant but not alarmed,"" she said. ""During the next few days, the military will return to their original positions. ""I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for their hard work, and also the police, the security services and the emergency services who did such a fantastic job."" She added that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), which sets the terror threat level, had decided ""sufficient progress has been made"" to lower it. But she warned the Parsons Green investigation was ""still an ongoing operation"". :: How the UK's terror threat levels work Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, who is the UK's most senior counter-terrorism officer, also announced that police were ""getting a greater understanding of the preparation of the device"". He confirmed more police - some armed - would remain in place on the streets and transport networks at the beginning of the week. The announcements come after two men were being held in connection with the Tube blast. An 18-year-old man was arrested in the departure lounge of Dover port, in Kent, and a 21-year-old man was detained in Hounslow, west London."

He was released on bail after being charged with ""driving whilst over the prescribed limit"". The Liverpool-born player, whose wife Coleen is pregnant with their fourth child, retired from international football in August having captained the Three Lions since 2014. Rooney, of Collar House Drive, Prestbury, is England's all-time top scorer with 53 goals. He rejoined boyhood club Everton this summer after 13 years at Manchester United. On his return to Old Trafford on Sunday, Rooney was given a warm welcome and left to a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 82nd minute. But it was Manchester United's Antonio Valencia that got fans on their feet as an outstanding half-volley kicked-off a United win that ended 4-0."
2017-09-17,It's the slogan that just won't die.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170918045845/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnsons-almost-defensible-fib-of-350m-for-nhs-11041538,"The potent ""£350m/NHS"" claim caused huge controversy during the EU referendum campaign and it was repeated this week by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, prompting the UK's leading statistician to accuse him of ""clear misuse of official statistics"". What's all the fuss about? It was just a slogan, right? A marketing pitch in a sea of deceptive claims during the referendum. Oh, but this one was clever in its trickery and its notoriety is well-earned. It may have swung the referendum result and, therefore, changed the course of history. Vote Leave strategist Dominic Cummings reflected after the result: ""Would we have won without £350m/NHS? All our research and the close result strongly suggests no."" Where did the slogan come from? In 2011 Matthew Elliott ran the ""No to AV"" referendum campaign in which he discovered a successful formula: rather than talk about the democratic benefits or disadvantages of each electoral system, he focused his campaign on cost. In his calculations for the cost of changing the UK's voting system he included the cost of the referendum itself. He then took this rather suspect figure of £250m and made slogans about how the money could be better spent on things like hospital equipment. His opponents kept talking about it - partly because the figure was misleading - and therefore gave it more publicity. (This would happen again in 2016) He won the AV referendum. 70% of people voted against it. Matthew Elliott later became chief executive of Vote Leave and, 18 months before the campaign, he and Cummings ran focus groups about EU membership. Taking back control and wasting money on the EU budget were hugely resonant issues raised by members of the public. In a 2014 report Cummings quotes a person saying that leaving the EU meant ""we will save a fortune and we can spend that money on the NHS"". The slogan began to write itself. So then they just needed an amount. The latest figures show the gross contribution to the EU as a weekly payment is £326m. After the rebate, which is docked from the bill, it is £251m. Then if you include subsidies and other contributions that flow back from the EU, the actual net figure is £165m a week - about half of the amount on the Vote Leave bus. That makes the slogan seem like a rather big fib. Elliott says he will defend the £350m figure until his dying day. He reasons that people refer to their gross salary so why not refer to the gross figure of what we send to the EU? The row over the figure raged throughout the campaign and returned this weekend when the Foreign Secretary once again talked of £350m a week and how ""a lot"" of it could be used for the NHS. The chairman of the UK's statistics authority said: ""This confuses gross and net contributions. ""It also assumes that payments currently made to the UK by the EU, including for example support for agriculture and scientific research, would not continue to be paid by the UK government when we leave."" However, Johnson wrote back that this was a ""wilful distortion"" of his article. His argument is that, although £350m is a gross figure, the UK doesn't have control of how the EU spends the money in the UK. He says ""I in fact said: 'once we have settled our accounts we will take back control of roughly £350m per week'. It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS."" This does give him wriggle room. The UK's priorities may amount to similar funds being attributed to farming and scientific research, but perhaps some will be diverted to health. ""A lot of money"" doesn't specify the full £350m. These caveats makes the apparent fib more defensible. I have checked interviews I conducted with Johnson during the campaign and at the time he said the same thing. One interview on the bus goes: Johnson: ""A proportion of that does come back to the UK - but it is spent at the whim, the dictate of EU officials. But half of that we never see again."" Me: ""But the other half - you can't spend on the NHS - shouldn't it say £170m?"" Johnson: ""What you can do is make sure the money that comes back to this country is spent on our priorities."" Me: ""But you need to spend it on the NHS, because that's what the bus says."" Johnson: ""And you could spend a lot more money on the NHS and other priorities such as farming."" Me: ""You should write that on the bus."" Johnson: ""It's a big bus but there's a limit the size of the slogan we can write on it."" While you could argue the case about subsidies, it's harder when it comes to the rebate. This mechanism automatically reduces the UK's contributions to the EU budget. It maybe negotiable, and there had been some pressure to scrap it in the future - but it is simply disingenuous to pretend that it doesn't exist right now. Paul Johnson from the Institute of Fiscal Studies told Sky News: ""The £350m comes if you assume essentially that the EU would continue to pay us a rebate after we've stopped paying them. It makes no sense whatsoever. ""I've got the quote here from Boris Johnson which says 'we will take back control of £350m pounds a week'. Well we won't."" So let me try to lay this debate to rest. We don't send £350m to the EU and we won't have anything like that figure to spend on the NHS after we leave the EU. But Boris Johnson used nuance to avoid ever specifying that we would. Even though you might have thought he said it. But he travelled in a bus with a slogan emblazoned on it that didn't quite have his subtlety of delivery."

He took over the party in July after a disappointing result at the General Election, where the party campaigned on an anti-Brexit platform but failed to capitalise on disappointed Remain voters. He leads a group of just 12 MPs, and said his job is to build numbers up again - but insists his party can provide a ""moderate, common-sense alternative"" amid the turmoil of British politics. ""As leader of the third UK party, my job is to be the alternative prime minister,"" he told The Andrew Marr Show. ""I think British politics is in a remarkable state of flux,"" he said. ""You've got the Conservative Party now in a state of complete civil war, the Labour Party in a state of suppressed civil war, and that will break out again once they start deselecting moderate people"", ""And I think people will look for a moderate, sort of common sense alternative and that's what we are for."" Sir Vince, a former business secretary, said it is ""perfectly plausible"" he could replace Theresa May in Downing Street. At 74, he is the oldest ever Lib Dem leader and the oldest head of a major party since Sir Winston Churchill, who stepped down as Tory leader aged 80. But he has already dismissed suggestions his age might be a problem, saying he has the energy to lead the party. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Ed Davey also talked up Sir Vince's Number 10 ambitions. He told Sky News: ""If you put him up against Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn, I think the majority of people would rather have Vince in Number 10 because he comes with huge credibility, particularly on the economy."" The Lib Dem conference is expected to be dominated by Brexit. Sir Vince acknowledged public opinion had not changed much since the referendum last year, but said it would once the economic reality of withdrawal from the EU sank in. He said voters should be offered a new vote on Brexit, saying it would be a ""first referendum on the facts"" once the terms of a deal with Brussels were known."

2017-09-17,"The pound may have been the worst performing major currency of recent times, but during the last three months it has been on an absolute tear.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170918045845/http://news.sky.com/story/a-rate-rise-conundrum-despite-sterling-surge-against-dollar-11036647,"Having traded as low as $1.2587 as recently as 21 June, it hit $1.3615 earlier on Friday, a gain of 8%. The pound is now trading against the greenback at levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU in June last year. That may not sound like much, given that the pound was trading at $1.50 before news of the Leave vote came through, but it does represent a significant recovery given that, around the time of the 'flash crash' on 7 October last year, some wild-eyed souls in the currency markets were talking seriously about the pound going all the way to $1.05. Against the euro, the gains have been less dramatic, reflecting the single currency's status as the best-performing major currency this year. Sterling's recent rally has merely brought it back to levels seen in mid-July. However, given that it was not that long ago that some people were speculating the pound might hit parity against the euro, it still represents a solid recovery. No one is talking any more about one pound being equal in value to one euro, at least, not outside the price-gouging currency exchange units at one or two UK airports. The reason for this rally, of course, is that the market is starting to price in an interest rate rise. A series of events have given this sentiment impetus, including news on Tuesday this week that consumer price inflation had hit 2.9% and Wednesday's news of another drop in the jobless rate to just 4.3%. This was followed on Thursday by minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee that revealed a majority of members believe that, in the absence of bad news, ""some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months"". That was reinforced in a speech on Friday by Gertjan Vlieghe, previously seen as one of the 'doves' on the MPC, in which he said ""the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when Bank rate may need to rise"". Mr Vlieghe added that this ""may be as early as the coming months"". These developments raise two questions. The first is the extent to which Bank Rate may have to increase. There is a school of thought in the market that the UK economy, in spite of the robust job creation figures, is losing momentum and may continue to do so while uncertainty persists over the Brexit deal that the UK is going to strike with the EU. That is certainly believed to be the view of Mark Carney, the Bank's governor. If shared by most other members of the MPC, it could mean monetary policy could merely be tightened to the extent of reversing last year's emergency rate cut made by the Bank following the Leave vote, bringing Bank rate back to 0.5%. This view, summed up in the phrase 'one and done', has it that the UK economy faces several years of uncertainty and that household finances are still quite fragile. The jobless rate may be falling but earnings growth is not keeping pace with inflation. Some UK households, it is argued, might struggle to meet their mortgage repayments even if there is a modest rate rise. Yet there is also a case for going further. Inflation is well ahead of the Bank's central target of 2%, unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and the UK economy is set to grow this year at around 1.7% which, while low, is not wildly out of kilter with the growth rates seen since the global financial crisis. Add to that the fact that the UK stock market is now into the eighth year of its current bull run and, on Wall Street, the rally has been going on longer than that. We are due another big stock market reversal together with the hit to confidence that would involve. Raising rates further now, it can be argued, will give the Bank scope to cut them again if it needs to rebuild confidence in the future. The other question is whether the MPC can be believed when it makes hawkish noises of the kind it has been this week. Mr Carney has, in the past, dropped heavy hints that interest rate rises are on the way - most famously at a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 and at Lincoln Cathedral in 2015 - only for him not to follow through with them. This led Labour MP Pat McFadden, then a member of the Treasury Select Committee, to dub him the ""unreliable boyfriend"". There are, however, alternatives to raising interest rates. One would be to start unwinding the Bank's £435bn worth of asset purchases undertaken since the financial crisis - Quantitative Easing in the jargon - which would have a similar impact to raising longer-term interest rates. Another would be to call a halt to the Term Funding Scheme, part of the stimulus package that was introduced after the Brexit vote, which aimed to ensure that banks passed on the full extent of the emergency rate cut. There is a view that all the scheme has done is fatten the profits of the banks and helped pump up another bubble in consumer borrowing - something about which the Bank itself has been worrying. A final measure that could be taken to stop consumer borrowing expanding dangerously could be taken by the Treasury, rather than the Bank, which would be to end the Help to Buy scheme. All the evidence suggests that this measure, introduced by the former Chancellor George Osborne in the hope of winning a few votes from would-be homeowners, has merely boosted the profitability of the housebuilders by stimulating demand for homes without doing anything to encourage building more of them."
2017-09-17,"The Prime Minister said the decision was ""historic"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170918045845/http://news.sky.com/story/parliament-supports-eu-withdrawal-bill-but-threat-of-brexit-rebellion-remains-11031615,"But it seems clear she also knows Parliament's approval for the EU Withdrawal Bill to proceed to its next stage was unmistakably conditional. To have marshalled enough parliamentary discipline to avoid any Conservative or DUP rebellion - while also seeing seven Labour MPs join them in the voting lobbies - will be savoured as a victory for Theresa May, not least on a matter as traditionally divisive for her party as Europe. But her acknowledgement on Tuesday morning that ""there is more to do"" is a significant understatement. Numerous Conservative MPs have expressed deep concern about the anti-democratic impact of the bill in its current form, and have made it abundantly clear there is a price to pay for their midnight support. As dawn broke, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also gave signals the Government understood the terms, telling Sky News it was right that Parliament look into the detail of the bill, insisting ministers would be ""listening"". On the Conservative benches, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, former business minister Anna Soubry and former chancellor Ken Clarke were among those who chose not to pull the trigger on a rebellion on Monday night. However, the gun is still loaded and if serious changes are not made as MPs in committees dissect the bill line by line, it may yet be used. Indeed, up to 12 Tory MPs are believed to already be backing amendments tabled for consideration by committee. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has also made clear he intends to make the committee stage of the bill as testing for the Government as possible, despite the divisions within his own party that Monday night's vote exposed. Labour's amendments have already been tabled - focused on watering down the executive powers given to ministers to make law with limited parliamentary scrutiny, securing protections on human rights and environmental standards, and ensuring devolved powers remain devolved. But Sir Keir is also suggesting the bill may be already beyond repair - arguing the Prime Minister should have dropped it and started again, rather than burdening Parliament with the task of mangling the current form into something more acceptable to those who opposed its second reading. ""This is likely to cause delays and division in Parliament, and the Prime Minister has nobody to blame but herself,"" SIr Keir said. However, when it comes to the other opposition parties, it is not just the Government but Labour they hold in contempt. The Liberal Democrats accused Labour rebels of handing the government victory, while Plaid Cymru said Labour's lack of unity risked ""letting the Tories off the hook"". But Labour rebels seem far less likely at another crucial Commons vote due to be held once more in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Government is seeking to grant itself a majority on the selection committee - the body which chooses the make-up of MPs on the standing committees that scrutinise legislation - another step which the opposition parties have labelled a ""power grab"". The controversy lies in the fact that the Conservatives have no outright majority and therefore, critics say, the balance should be equally split between Labour and the Tories. Not so, argue the Government - pointing to the fact they have a majority on the floor of the House with DUP support that will see the motion pass, and therefore a majority on the selection committee is warranted to avoid logjams in the business of legislating.

The controversial claim even led Leave campaigner Dr Sarah Wollaston to defect to the Remain camp, saying Leave had ""knowingly placed a financial lie at the heart of their campaign"".

It had careered across the northbound carriageway between junctions 16 and 14 in south Gloucestershire on Saturday. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed four people had died and three others are in a life-threatening condition in hospital. The driver of the lorry was also taken to hospital as a precaution. All three lanes of the southbound carriage have reopened but work is continuing to reopen the northbound carriage. Cardiologist Amer Hamed was in a car travelling seconds behind the crash. He and other medically qualified people stopped to help an injured woman. Plymouth-based marine Alex Morgan told Somerset Live he had been travelling to a wedding in Coventry when he saw the lorry plunge down a ditch and a car on its roof. He said: ""On approaching the vehicle I could already hear two children screaming and when looking inside they were both in the back suspended upside down from their seat belts. ""They were both fully conscious with no initial signs of serious bleeding or injury, so I unclipped the little girl's seatbelt and carried her out as others worked to extinguish the front of the vehicle.""

He said: ""Emergency service personnel have been working tirelessly at the scene in harrowing conditions and I'd like to praise them for the work they've done and are still doing. ""I'd also like to thank the members of the public who courageously went to the aid of those involved in this collision and in some cases rescued them from their vehicles. ""Our priority is to ensure the victims' next of kin are notified and supported, as well as the ongoing management of the scene, and this important work is ongoing."" He added: ""We know this has been extremely disruptive to many people but we've had to prioritise the rescue and recovery operation and ensure we carry out a thorough investigation at the scene.

They say close relatives have been raped and slaughtered by military forces in Myanmar. In just a few weeks hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have crossed the border seeking refuge in Bangladesh. A group of 300 who followed a similar route in previous years have now settled in Bradford. They spoke about the pain of seeing the crisis ""explode"" on television and social media. Eighteen-year-old sports student Sayeed Amin spent time as a child in a Bangladeshi refugee camp before coming to Britain. His grandparents are still in Myanmar. ""I have quite sharp images of what those people are going through now. I feel really devastated and guilty because now even though I'm in a country where I have free will I've not been able to... give them the help that I'm getting,"" he said. Other Rohingya Muslims say that because relatives are denied basic freedoms such as access to mobile phones it has been impossible to make contact. Deen Mohammed Noori of the Arakan Rohingya Organisation in Bradford, urged Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi to break her silence and prevent further persecution. ""A few years ago we demonstrated on the streets of Bradford for her release from house arrest,"" he told Sky News. ""Now, when we need her support she is silent. ""We expected her to speak up for these people and that she would sort out the problems and try to control the situation so that everyone would have equal rights, everybody would have freedom of life, everybody would have freedom of worship.""

She has faces strong international criticism for her lack of action over the violence against Rohingya Muslims."

The Canada-EU deal, which eliminates 98% of Canadian import duties is a ""significant boon"" for British exporters, said No 10, as it announced plans for a new joint working group to work on the bilateral deal post Brexit. But Mrs May's attempts to build global goodwill over Brexit was undermined over the weekend after Boris Johnson penned a lengthy article in the Daily Telegraph setting out his Brexit blueprint, on the eve of her Canadian trip and just days before she delivers a keynote Brexit speech in Florence. The Foreign Secretary's intervention just days before Mrs May's landmark speech sparked speculation that her rival is preparing a leadership challenge. It provoked fury from some backbenchers and fuelled speculation over his future as foreign secretary as deep cabinet divisions over Brexit were laid bare once more. Amber Rudd, the pro-Remain Home Secretary, accused him on ""back seat driving"" as she urged ministers to be united in their approach to Brexit. Downing Street sought to keep a lid on the tensions - insisting that Mr Johnson would not be sacked. The Foreign Secretary is not due to travel to with the prime minister for her flying visit to Ottawa - she is in the country for just 8 hours - but the pair will be reunited at the United Nations General Assembly summit in New York later in the week. No 10 said Mr Johnson is expected to attend Mrs May's speech on UN reform on Wednesday. Mrs May's visit to Canada comes just three weeks after she travelled to Japan, again with the aim of securing a bilateral deal with the country after Brexit. Japan and the EU has yet to finalise a trade deal, however the Canada-EU deal, which eliminates 98% of Canadian import duties, comes into effect on 21 September. No 10 described the deal as a ""significant boon"" for British exporters, as it announced plans for a new joint working group to work on the bilateral deal post Brexit. The trade relationship between the two economics is worth £15.2bn a year, with over 10,000 British companies exporting goods to Canada. A number of commercial deals are expected to be signed on her one-day visit as the Prime Minister also hosts a business round table with major Canadian investors into the UK. The UK cannot sign any trade deals with other countries while it is a member of the EU. But the government is busily preparing the ground for post-Brexit deals with leading world economies since as the US, Japan and Canada. When Britain leaves the EU, it will fall out of trade deals between the European trading bloc and other countries, such as the Canadian deal which took seven years to negotiate. However, it is unclear what will happen regarding such trade deals during a ""transition period"" expected to last up to three years after the official Brexit date in March 2019. Speaking ahead of the visit, the Prime Minister said her visit was about ""recognising our past but also looking ahead to our bright future. We are both countries with ambitions to lead on the world stage and progressive values that underpin those ambitions - values including the importance of free trade, and respect of international law."" No 10 has appointed Andrew Percy, the former northern powerhouse minister, as her new trade envoy for Canada."

According to reports, Mr McClean was holidaying in Sri Lanka with friends and authorities believe he was dragged away by a crocodile after he stepped into the lagoon about 220 miles east of the capital Colombo. The post-mortem examination found he drowned after being bitten on his right leg, but it did not confirm if it was a crocodile that grabbed him, said a police official who saw the report. The official added: ""There were six teeth marks of an animal on his right leg. There was no specific mention of a crocodile attack because the JMO (judicial medical officer) could not verify it immediately."" Magistrate Mohamed Hilmy, who visited the coastal village on Friday, ordered an inquest to be held on Monday. The FT's managing editor James Lamont described him as ""a talented, energetic and dedicated young journalist"". He said: ""Our thoughts are with his family, friends and loved ones. We are in touch with them, doing all we can to help during this difficult time."" Margaritis Schinas, spokesman for European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, said Mr McClean, who had also worked in Brussels for the FT, was ""well known and well liked"". He added: ""He was an extremely talented and dedicated young journalist. He had an exceptional eye for detail and never shied away from difficult stories. ""But above all, Paul was a gentleman and an absolute pleasure to work with. He will be fondly remembered and greatly missed by all in the spokespersons' service and in the wider Brussels community."" Although crocodile attacks are rare in Sri Lanka, earlier this month wildlife authorities reported that a crocodile had seriously injured a wild elephant in the south of the island. During monsoon floods in May, authorities warned people in inundated areas to be aware of stray crocodiles."

His name was Sam, ""Sam the smuggler"". The newspapers called him ""Ulster's Robin Hood"". In the early 1950s, he began bolstering his modest income by exploiting the Irish border. It was tea at first, then butter and finally cigarettes. Evading the customs became his favourite pastime. He didn't always succeed. Sam was convicted of smuggling and twice served time in prison. At the height of his cross-border game, he was making £300 per week, a lot of money back then. But he was losing just as much - some £20,000 in fines and in the value of goods and cars seized. The thrill of the chase kept him going. He just got a buzz from his clandestine escapades. Accounts of him out-running police cars, on both sides of the border, have gone down in folklore. He came clean in the end and confessed to having been a professional smuggler for eight years. ""I am not ashamed of my past,"" he would say, ""everyone was smuggling when stuff was scarce. ""If only I had stopped"" when making more than losing, ""I would have been on top of the world. ""The one really big mistake of my smuggling career was when I decided to keep going."" Neighbours, with whom he had shared his loot, later persuaded him to run for a seat at Stormont. So the North Armagh constituency had an unlikely independent candidate on the ballot paper in the 1958 election. He didn't win but the honest confession of his shady past had gained him an unexpected admirer. When Sam died suddenly, aged 54, the Rev Ian Paisley turned up and participated in his funeral. On both sides of the political divide, there was a cultural ambivalence about subsistence smuggling. Fifty years after his death, people still talk about ""Sam the smuggler"" who stood for election. His campaign slogan: ""Thank heavens, here's Blevins."" Yes Blevins. Sam was my grandfather."

Cordons have been put around a 100-metre radius and will not be removed until the operation is completed. Residents went to nearby Staines Rugby Club and some were taken by bus to a community centre in Shepperton. They were eventually allowed back into their homes late on Saturday night. Neighbouring Burgoyne Road was also closed and a large crowd gathered at the entrance of the road. Mojgan Jamali, who lives in Cavendish Road, said she was told by police she had ""one minute"" to pack her bags, grab her children, and leave her home.

Sky News has discovered that the person who is registered to the address has links to Ron and Penny Jones, whose house in Sunbury was raided on Saturday. The 21-year-old was detained in Hounslow, west London at around 11.50pm on the same day. He is being held at a police station in south London under the Terrorism Act. Police are also searching an address in Hounslow. Thirty people were injured during London's Friday morning rush hour when an improvised explosive device detonated on a Tube train. Footage has emerged of a man in Sunbury carrying a Lidl bag, similar to the one the suspected device was hidden in, around an hour and a half before the attack. The man was seen on camera at 6.50am reportedly leaving a house which police would later search. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said police were ""working hard"" to track down those responsible for the blast.

Her comments come after an 18-year-old man was arrested on Saturday in the departure lounge of Dover port in connection with the blast. A local councillor has said the teenager is understood to be an Iraqi orphan who had moved to Britain when he was 15 after his parents died. Ian Harvey, leader of Spelthorne Borough Council whose ward is Sunbury East, said he had discovered the boy's background from neighbours of the Joneses and publicly available information. He said: ""One thing I understand is that he was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15 - his parents died in Iraq."" :: Scale of anti-terror probes 'unprecedented' On Saturday officers searched a house in Surrey they said was directly linked to the first arrest. The property is registered to an elderly foster couple who had been honoured for their work with child refugees. Following the search, police set up cordons on nearby roads, which have since been reopened. In the wake of the bombing, police hinted they were searching for more than one suspect, and said they were keeping an ""open mind"" as to whether multiple people were involved."

He would then pair these with antique revolvers and weapons purchased from legitimate firearms dealers and auctions across the country. The 22-year-old was arrested on 20 February after arranging for a hand grenade to be delivered to his home in Bordesley Green, Birmingham. Intercepting the parcel, officers replaced the contents with a non-explosive substitute before allowing it to be delivered. Four revolvers and 15 rounds of ammunition were also discovered at the property. A second man, Nazim Hussain, 47, who helped store and distribute the weapons and ammunition, was jailed for nine years at Birmingham Crown Court. The judge described both men as being in the 'premier league' of firearms suppliers. Ammunition was smuggled into the UK via postal parcels and packets sent from Sweden in sophisticated vehicle concealments. Signed for at multiple addresses across Birmingham, the ammunition was then sold by Khan - along with the antique firearms - to organised crime groups across the UK. Officers described Khan as having ""no thought for where or how the weapons would be used"". One weapon was recovered fully loaded and in the hands of a Class A drug dealer who was stopped in a stolen vehicle during a West Midlands investigation. Two stun guns were also imported, disguised as a knuckle-duster and torch. Khan is known to have bought more than 50 revolvers and 1,600 rounds of ammunition over the course of two years, but police believe he could be linked to many more cases. Officers are urging anyone who bought illegal weapons from the men to either contact their local firearms licensing department or surrender any weapons to avoid a criminal conviction or possible custodial sentence.Anyone with information about illegally held firearms can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111."
2017-09-18,The UK's plan to leave the customs union has fuelled fears of an upsurge in smuggling on the Irish border.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-fuels-smuggling-fears-on-the-irish-border-11041595,"Different tax regimes on either side of it for the first time could increase the opportunity for illegal profit-making. It is a serious concern for Fianna Fail's Brendan Smith, a member of the Irish parliament from a border constituency. He said: ""Criminal gangs have become big smugglers. What I fear is border checkpoints and different pricing and different trading conditions both sides of the border. ""That will give, unfortunately, an impetus to those criminal gangs in their smuggling behaviour."" Ireland has a long history of smuggling. Illicit journeys from one jurisdiction to the other were a by-product of partition. Elderly people vividly recall their attempts to evade the customs when transporting groceries for a meagre profit. Peadar Morgan, who learned to smuggle while still at school, explained: ""We got two ropes and we tied 30 dozen of eggs, a wooden case, on our backs to take from the south up to the north. ""We were just going up the field, about 100 yards, when the next thing we heard this shout: 'Customs'. ""One of them caught me by the arm… and when I looked around, well let's just say the customs man and myself fell out."" Sam was one of the more notorious. His smuggled tea, butter and cigarettes and his exploits landed him in prison twice. The newspapers called him ""Ulster's Robin Hood"". Neighbours even persuaded him to stand for election. But the cultural ambivalence about smuggling was shattered by the outbreak of the Northern Ireland troubles. The exploitation of the border became a commercial operation with the IRA laundering fuel to fund its terrorist campaign. Crime author and journalist Paul Williams explained: ""This multimillion pound smuggling operation continued over 30 years on an industrial scale ""It was right under the noses of the British Army watchtowers and helicopters and on the other side, intensive Garda activity and Irish army activity and customs activity. ""Now that was perhaps the hardest border you could get."" There are at least 12 different criminal gangs operating on the border now, trafficking fuel, drugs and alcohol among other things. Before the Brexit vote, their activity was already costing the Irish exchequer an estimated €800m (£703m) per year."

The search at the well-respected couple's house in Cavendish Road in Sunbury-on-Thames follows the ""very significant arrest"" of an 18-year-old in Dover. The teenager is the is now being held at a London police station. A second man, aged 21, was also arrested in Hounslow on Sunday. In the operation by armed police in Surrey, Cavendish Road was evacuated as a precautionary measure. Local resident Nicola Ryder described Mr and Mrs Jones as ""beautiful people"". She said she knew them as Penny and Ron, and that they would foster up to seven young people at a time. The couple are believed to have been foster parents for almost 40 years and had taken in 268 children. Cordons have been set up at a 100-metre radius from the Sunbury property which will remain in place until the search has been completed. After the evacuation, residents of Cavendish Road went to a local rugby club and some were taken by bus to a community centre in Shepperton. They were allowed to return to their homes later on Saturday night. Mojgan Jamali, 33, who lives in Cavendish Road, said she was given ""one minute"" by police to pack her bags, grab her children and leave her home. ""I was in my house with my children and there was a knock at the door from the police. ""They told me to leave,"" said Mrs Jamali. ""They said: 'You have one minute to get out of the house and get away.' ""I just got out, I got my three children and we left the house and the street.'""

The majority have been allowed back into their homes now, but some remain displaced by the police investigation. :: Analysis: Scale of anti-terror probes 'unprecedented' The Home Secretary Amber Rudd described the earlier arrest of an 18-year-old man in connection with Friday morning's attack as ""very significant"", but added ""the operation is ongoing"". Thirty people were injured in the explosion during the Friday morning rush hour as the District Line train was pulling into the west London station of Parsons Green. Of those injured, 19 victims were taken to hospital by ambulance, while 11 presented themselves for treatment. All but one have now been released from hospital. The attack sparked a huge manhunt for a potential network of plotters, with the country's top counter-terrorism officer suggesting more than one suspect could have been involved. The UK's terror threat level was raised to critical - the highest level - late on Friday, meaning another attack is expected imminently. :: How the UK's terror threat levels work Mrs Rudd said that the threat level will remain at critical, and that it was ""good fortune"" that the bomb did ""so little damage"". She added it was ""too early"" to say whether those responsible for the Parsons Green bombing were known to the authorities. ""We will have to make sure to take all steps that we can to ensure the sort of materials that this man was able to collect become more and more difficult to combine together. ""We will always learn from these sort of incidents."""

The 74-year-old former business secretary will clearly label the Liberal Democrats as ""the party of Remain,"" while accusing those managing the negotiations of living in a ""world of infantile fairy tales"". Sir Vince has been accused by some within his party of being too soft on opposing a so-called hard Brexit, but his first address as leader will set out his demands for a vote on the final deal. He will tell conference: ""Let me be clear. This is not a call for a re-run - a second referendum - on Brexit.""It is a call for a first referendum on the facts: when we know what Brexit means. ""We know that our call will, of course, be resented by the Brexit fundamentalists. ""We will be denounced as traitors and saboteurs. I'm half prepared for a spell in a cell with supreme court judges, Gina Miller, Ken Clarke, and the governors of the BBC."" The Liberal Democrat autumn conference has been overshadowed by Boris Johnson's weekend intervention on Brexit in which he suggested the UK should refuse to pay billions to the EU as part of the settlement. But Sir Vince Cable won a conference vote in which a group of delegates attempted to commit the party to reversing the Article 50 process without another public vote."
2017-09-18,"The pound may have been the worst performing major currency of recent times, but during the last three months it has been on an absolute tear.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/a-rate-rise-conundrum-despite-sterling-surge-against-dollar-11036647,"Having traded as low as $1.2587 as recently as 21 June, it hit $1.3615 earlier on Friday, a gain of 8%. The pound is now trading against the greenback at levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU in June last year. That may not sound like much, given that the pound was trading at $1.50 before news of the Leave vote came through, but it does represent a significant recovery given that, around the time of the 'flash crash' on 7 October last year, some wild-eyed souls in the currency markets were talking seriously about the pound going all the way to $1.05. Against the euro, the gains have been less dramatic, reflecting the single currency's status as the best-performing major currency this year. Sterling's recent rally has merely brought it back to levels seen in mid-July. However, given that it was not that long ago that some people were speculating the pound might hit parity against the euro, it still represents a solid recovery. No one is talking any more about one pound being equal in value to one euro, at least, not outside the price-gouging currency exchange units at one or two UK airports. The reason for this rally, of course, is that the market is starting to price in an interest rate rise. A series of events have given this sentiment impetus, including news on Tuesday this week that consumer price inflation had hit 2.9% and Wednesday's news of another drop in the jobless rate to just 4.3%. This was followed on Thursday by minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee that revealed a majority of members believe that, in the absence of bad news, ""some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months"". That was reinforced in a speech on Friday by Gertjan Vlieghe, previously seen as one of the 'doves' on the MPC, in which he said ""the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when Bank rate may need to rise"". Mr Vlieghe added that this ""may be as early as the coming months"". These developments raise two questions. The first is the extent to which Bank Rate may have to increase. There is a school of thought in the market that the UK economy, in spite of the robust job creation figures, is losing momentum and may continue to do so while uncertainty persists over the Brexit deal that the UK is going to strike with the EU. That is certainly believed to be the view of Mark Carney, the Bank's governor. If shared by most other members of the MPC, it could mean monetary policy could merely be tightened to the extent of reversing last year's emergency rate cut made by the Bank following the Leave vote, bringing Bank rate back to 0.5%. This view, summed up in the phrase 'one and done', has it that the UK economy faces several years of uncertainty and that household finances are still quite fragile. The jobless rate may be falling but earnings growth is not keeping pace with inflation. Some UK households, it is argued, might struggle to meet their mortgage repayments even if there is a modest rate rise. Yet there is also a case for going further. Inflation is well ahead of the Bank's central target of 2%, unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and the UK economy is set to grow this year at around 1.7% which, while low, is not wildly out of kilter with the growth rates seen since the global financial crisis. Add to that the fact that the UK stock market is now into the eighth year of its current bull run and, on Wall Street, the rally has been going on longer than that. We are due another big stock market reversal together with the hit to confidence that would involve. Raising rates further now, it can be argued, will give the Bank scope to cut them again if it needs to rebuild confidence in the future. The other question is whether the MPC can be believed when it makes hawkish noises of the kind it has been this week. Mr Carney has, in the past, dropped heavy hints that interest rate rises are on the way - most famously at a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 and at Lincoln Cathedral in 2015 - only for him not to follow through with them. This led Labour MP Pat McFadden, then a member of the Treasury Select Committee, to dub him the ""unreliable boyfriend"". There are, however, alternatives to raising interest rates. One would be to start unwinding the Bank's £435bn worth of asset purchases undertaken since the financial crisis - Quantitative Easing in the jargon - which would have a similar impact to raising longer-term interest rates. Another would be to call a halt to the Term Funding Scheme, part of the stimulus package that was introduced after the Brexit vote, which aimed to ensure that banks passed on the full extent of the emergency rate cut. There is a view that all the scheme has done is fatten the profits of the banks and helped pump up another bubble in consumer borrowing - something about which the Bank itself has been worrying. A final measure that could be taken to stop consumer borrowing expanding dangerously could be taken by the Treasury, rather than the Bank, which would be to end the Help to Buy scheme. All the evidence suggests that this measure, introduced by the former Chancellor George Osborne in the hope of winning a few votes from would-be homeowners, has merely boosted the profitability of the housebuilders by stimulating demand for homes without doing anything to encourage building more of them."

He was nearly three times over the limit when he was pulled over by police at 2.10am on 1 September. The black Volkwagen Beetle that was stopped in Wilmslow, Cheshire, belonged to lettings agent Laura Simpson. Rooney's wife, Coleen, was away with the couple's three sons when he was arrested. When he was stopped he was found to have 104 microgrammes of alcohol in every 100ml of his breath. The limit is 35 microgrammes. Rooney's legal team had asked the judge at Stockport Magistrates' Court to consider not imposing a community order because of the charity work he undertakes. But District Judge John Temperley said he was ""not convinced"" that imposing a large fine ""would have the same effect"". He said: ""This was a serious offence that you admitted. You were driving a motor vehicle nearly three times the limit. ""You were carrying a passenger, which is an aggravating factor."" The judge added: ""You are a young man with no similar previous convictions. ""I have read a bundle of character references handed in on your behalf and they speak very highly of you as a person. I accept your remorse is genuine."" The Liverpool-born player, whose wife is expecting their fourth child, retired from international football in August having captained the Three Lions since 2014. His solicitor Michael Rainford said in court: ""Wayne Rooney wishes to express his genuine remorse for what was a terrible mistake, a terrible error of judgement on his part that evening. ""He realises he has not only let himself down very badly but his family."" In a statement issued after his guilty plea, tweeted out to his Twitter followers, he said he was sorry. He said: ""Following today's court hearing I want publicly to apologise for my unforgivable lack of judgement in driving while over the legal limit. It was completely wrong. ""I have already said sorry to my family, my manager and chairman and everyone at Everton FC. Now I want to apologise to all the fans and everyone else who has followed and supported me throughout my career. ""Of course I accept the sentence of the court and hope that I can make some amends through my community service."" Rooney, from Prestbury, Cheshire, rejoined boyhood club Everton this summer after 13 years at Manchester United but returned to Old Trafford on Sunday for a match his team lost 4-0."
2017-09-18,The Government faces a growing revolt from carmakers in Britain unhappy at the slow pace of clarity over post-Brexit customs arrangements crucial to their business model.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/government-faces-brexit-revolt-from-unhappy-car-makers-over-customs-11041724,"Sky News has been shown internal industry memos, circulating at the Frankfurt Motor Show, expressing exasperation at the state of preparedness for changes to customs - which could come in in March 2019 and for which immediate investment and staffing is required. A recent meeting with Government was described as ""disillusioning"" because of a ""lack of detailed information and blocking of our questions"". Officials were described as having ""no concrete idea of how to apply [customs] proposals"". :: Brexit Forensics: Why the car industry is getting worried Instead of communicating detailed proposals, the meeting was taken as a ""desperate attempt"" to find out basic information and ""get the industry to suggest solutions"". At a separate meeting, Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralf Speth was said to have had a ""heated"" exchange with the Prime Minister at a Number 10 round table over summer, imploring Theresa May to avoid a ""no deal"" Brexit and to immediately prepare a transition arrangement with the same customs and trading arrangements. A senior Jaguar Land Rover executive told Sky News, as part of our Brexit Forensics investigation, that its recent investment in a massive facility in Slovakia has ""become a hedge"" against a post-Brexit deterioration in its trading conditions. ""It's become a hedge by default - we will assess everything in the cold light of day,"" said group sales operations director Andy Gross. Jaguar Land Rover is booming on global exports but played down the positive impact of a weak sterling or even the need for independent trade deals with its key markets in China and the US. Between 40-50% of the company's parts come from the EU, including expensive gear boxes from Germany. The industry has watched with trepidation as the Government has downgraded reassurances, especially as businesses perceive that it does not prioritise - and in some cases even understand - its ""just-in-time"" manufacturing methods and its pan-European ""integrated supply chains"". :: Brexit fuels smuggling fears on the Irish border At the Conservative Party conference a year ago, the Prime Minister promised British firms would maintain the ability to trade freely with and operate within the EU's single market. Mrs May's words then shifted to ""frictionless trade"" - and are now ""as frictionless as possible"". This weekend, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson claimed ""traditional carmakers would vanish"" within the next 20 years, to be replaced by new manufacturers of ""automated"" cars. Any friction in the free flow of parts and cars with Europe could have a severe impact on the competitiveness of UK car plants, which are routinely measured against their European counterparts, competing for production of new models within the same group. At the Mini plant in Oxford, bosses told Sky News they were preparing contingencies that could require a 50% increase in stock levels to cope with predicted delays of between 12 and 24 hours from customs checks at ports. ""We don't want to end up with an army of customs people in our plants... it's not just going to affect our operations, but things across the supply chain,"" chief financial officer Jeremy Stoyle told Sky News. In common with other UK facilities, 95% of parts for the 220 trucks arriving at the plant every day do not currently require a customs check. :: Germany plans for 'worst-case scenario' Brexit The industry is unimpressed with a proposal floating around Government that factories essentially enforce customs arrangements themselves, through a massive expansion of a current EU scheme for the accreditation of ""authorised economic operators"". There is also some tension over the Government repeatedly claiming investment decisions as endorsements of its Brexit strategy. One Cabinet minister was refused permission to conduct interviews from company premises, for this reason. The industry has been told, however, that the UK will not apply regulations different to the EU. Jaguar Land Rover goes further, saying the Government already accepts there will be no deviation from European standards at all. ""We made it quite clear that there is only one set of compliance in Europe - no noises from the UK Government that they (expect) any different from that,"" said Mr Gross. :: EU chiefs told to take a 'wise-up pill' on Brexit Last week at the Frankfurt Motor Show, a key boss at Toyota, which a few months ago invested £240m in its Derbyshire plant after assurances about zero tariffs, said the Government was ""not any more"" giving those assurances. BMW also played down the extent of its investment in a new electric Mini as at an ""early stage"". Of particular focus right now is the future of the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, now under the ownership of Peugeot group. Carlos Tavares, its cost-cutting boss, said: ""We don't know how Brexit is going to unfold... all this completely changed the business model."" Latest figures show overall levels of investment in car manufacturing as sharply down over the period of the EU referendum and since, as executives await some certainty on post-Brexit trading. ""As of today, nobody knows,"" Mr Gross told Sky News.

2017-09-18,"Police have been given more time to question two men over Friday's terror attack at Parsons Green Underground station, Scotland Yard says.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/first-pictures-of-arrested-tube-bomb-suspect-11041653,"These are the first pictures of one of the suspects being held by police investigating the Parsons Green Tube bombing. Yahyah Farroukh, 21, is listed as living at an address in Stanwell, Surrey, which was searched by officers on Sunday. He was arrested at a fried chicken shop where he worked in Hounslow, west London, on Saturday night. Another 18-year-old was detained at Dover ferry port on Saturday morning. The younger man is suspected of planting the device, which exploded on a District Line train in London on Friday morning, injuring 30 people. Police said the two men are being questioned on suspicion of offences under the Terrorism Act. Both men are believed to have spent time in the care of Penelope and Ronald Jones, who received MBEs for services to children and families in 2010. Sky News understands that Farroukh has a number of links to the Joneses. He is linked with Penny Jones via Facebook and is also one of the people most recently registered to the address where the couple live. The Joneses have been highly respected foster parents for almost 40 years and looked after up to 300 children, including eight refugees. Farroukh is originally from Damascus, according to his Facebook profile. West Thames College, where he said he studied English, confirmed he was a student between 2013 and 2015. Suleman Sarwar, 43, who owns Aladdin's Fried Chicken on Kingsley Road, Hounslow, with his brothers, said Farroukh was arrested outside the takeaway after his shift finished at 11.30pm on Saturday. He said: ""He was very normal, like anyone else, like any other member of staff or member of the public, nothing unusual, nothing particular about him."" He said Farroukh ""wasn't religious but he wasn't not religious either"". ""He prayed just like every local Muslim in this community - they do their standard five prayers - that's what he did. So he didn't show anything which was out of the ordinary."" Leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey, whose ward is Sunbury East, said the 18-year-old suspect is understood to be an Iraqi orphan who moved to Britain when he was 15. Mr Harvey said: ""One thing I understand is that he (the 18-year-old) was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15 - his parents died in Iraq."" Mr and Mrs Jones' home in Sunbury-on-Thames was searched by armed police on Saturday morning and is still being examined by counter-terrorism investigators. Mrs Jones previously told the website of Elmbridge CAN, a group which works to settle refugees in the Surrey borough of Elmbridge, that the couple had fostered refugees from Iraq, Eritrea, Syria, Albania and Afghanistan. She said: ""People think the language will be a huge problem. But it isn't. Social services provide us with image cards. I make them repeat the words and after six weeks… they have a basic level of English to go to college. ""There are different cultural needs. But I always tell them to guide me and I'll do what I can... we respect each other and our beliefs. ""You have to have time. You need to be able to go to the Home Office with them. You need to get them a solicitor. You have to have patience too and remember they've been through a lot. ""But it's so rewarding. They're grateful to be safe, to have a bed to sleep in and to have food and (our support)... that's all they need."" Footage has emerged of a man in Sunbury carrying a Lidl bag, similar to the one the suspected device was hidden in, at 6.50am, reportedly leaving a house which police later searched. On Sunday afternoon, the UK's terror threat level was lowered from its highest point of 'critical' to 'severe'. Meanwhile, all but one of those injured in the attack have been able to leave hospital. As well as injuries from the fire, many people were hurt in the stampede of passengers trying to escape the bomb."

A woman and two children are in hospital in a life-threatening condition, police said. Huge queues built up behind the crash scene after the motorway was closed in both directions. Avon and Somerset Police said: ""The closure is likely to be in place for a considerable amount of time and we'd ask people to avoid the area."" Pictures from the scene showed a truck on an embankment, with the rear of the lorry sticking up in the air. It was surrounded by emergency vehicles at the scene. Motorists have been advised to follow diversions.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court was shown video footage of his antics, which also included rummaging through a backpack to find a mobile phone. The car paint-sprayer, from Warrington in Cheshire, was filmed by an unmarked police patrol for 16 minutes as he rode northbound on the afternoon of 3 June. He was pulled over near Yarnfield by an officer from the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG). Zietowski, who admitted dangerous driving at a previous hearing, was also banned for 28 months. Originally from Poland, Zietowski told probation officers he was interested in stunt riding and was ""practising"" when he was spotted on the M6. But judge David Fletcher said his riding was ""hair-raising"", telling Zietowski he wanted the court to view the footage ""because I wanted to be sure that you had seen it"". ""You were showing off,"" the judge said. ""It was clearly driving which was over a lengthy period of time, involving speeds of up to 117mph, involving you twice removing the backpack. ""You were pulling wheelies on a number of occasions and at one point you were standing up with no hands on the handlebars. ""This was a piece of appalling driving.""

2017-09-18,"The average UK asking price for a home coming onto the market fell by 1.2% to £310,000 in September, according to Rightmove.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/no-autumn-house-price-bounce-for-first-time-since-2013-11041666,"Homeowners typically enjoy an autumn spike in property values, but new data for England and Wales shows that this is the first fall recorded at this time of year since 2013. It equates to a drop of around £3,660 in average values. The property website said a 2.9% or £18,358 price slump in London had played a part in the drop. The average price of a home in London now stands at £610,912, down from £629,270 in August. The drop was exacerbated by larger falls in some of the capital's high-end boroughs such as Kensington and Chelsea, where property values plunged by more than £300,000 from about £2.1m to £1.8m. The North East and Yorkshire and the Humber bucked the downward trend, with asking prices there increasing month-on-month, by 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. Housing demand remains high, the figures showed, with the numbers of sales being agreed by estate agents up by 4.8% on a year ago - including in London, which saw an increase of 5.6%. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said: ""Estate agents are clearly advising many sellers that they have to lower their price expectations to fit in with buyers' stretched financial resources, with that price compromise hopefully generating extra buyer interest."" Robert McLaughlin, sales director at Kinleigh Folkard and Hayward in London, who was quoted in Rightmove's report, said: ""We've advised sellers in many locations across London that the current market requires sensible and realistic pricing. ""Pockets of high demand still exist but tend to be concentrated around specific streets, schools and transport hubs."""
2017-09-18,Cyclist Charlie Alliston has been sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders' institution after a fatal crash in east London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/cyclist-charlie-alliston-sentenced-to-18-months-11042070,"The 20-year-old former courier was cleared of manslaughter in August but found guilty of causing bodily harm by ""wanton and furious driving"". Kim Briggs, 44, was knocked over in February 2016 as she was crossing Old Street during her lunch break. The HR consultant suffered serious injuries and died a week later in hospital. Alliston, who shouted at Mrs Briggs as she lay in the road with ""catastrophic"" injuries, was riding a ""fixie"", a fixed gear bike with no front brakes, used by track cyclists. Sentencing Alliston at the Old Bailey, Judge Wendy Joseph QC told him his ""whole manner of driving"" caused the accident. She said: ""I am satisfied in some part it was this so-called thrill that motivated you to ride without a front brake, shouting and swearing at pedestrians to get out of the way. ""I've heard your evidence and I have no doubt that even now you remain obstinately sure of yourself and your own abilities. You were an accident waiting to happen. The victim could have been any pedestrian. It was in fact Mrs Kim Briggs."" Fixie bikes are not legal to use on the road unless they have been modified to have a front brake. Alliston, from south London, who was 18 at the time, argued that he was unaware of the law and that it would not have stopped him in time anyway. But crash investigators concluded he would actually have been able to stop if a front brake had been fitted. The former bike courier said he had shouted a warning, slowed down, and swerved to avoid a collision. He criticised Mrs Briggs online, claiming she was at fault before deleting his comments when he realised how serious her injuries were. During the trial he told the court his comments had been stupid and not thought through. The judge said he had not shown ""one iota"" of remorse at any stage. The offence Alliston was found guilty of is a piece of legislation from the 19th century, and Mrs Briggs' husband, Matthew, speaking outside court, demanded the laws be updated. He said: ""This case has clearly and evidently demonstrated that there is a gap in the law when it comes to dealing with death or serious injury caused by dangerous cycling. ""To have to rely on either manslaughter at one end or a Victorian law that doesn't even mention causing death at the other end tells us that there is a gap. The fact that what happened to Kim is rare is not a reason for there to be no remedy."" Matthew Briggs said he refused to live his life in anger and vowed to bring up the couple's 14-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter ""in a way that Kim would have been proud of, to honour my wife""."

Bombardier has been accused by Boeing of receiving unfair state support - including a £113m loan from the British Government - for its new C Series passenger jet. Mrs May raised concerns about the future of the factory in a recent phone call with President Donald Trump and said she would raise it again with Mr Trudeau, who has been outspoken in urging Boeing to drop the case.

Mr Johnson is also attending Mrs May's 15-minute address to the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. There were terse words exchanged between the duo after the Foreign Secretary's decision to publish his own Brexit blueprint before the Prime Minister delivers a keynote speech in Florence on Friday. Mr Johnson sought to downplay the intervention, which he described as an ""opening drum roll"" ahead of the Prime Minister's keynote address. ""There's one driver in the car…it's Theresa."" But he also stood by the demands he made in his 4,200 word article in the Telegraph reiterating his belief that there can be no extended transition period after Britain leaves the EU by the end of March 2019. He also said the UK should not make ""extortionate"" payments to the EU for access to its markets. His position puts him at odds with the Chancellor Philip Hammond who has suggested that a transitional deal should replicate the status quo after Brexit in order to give London and Brussels time to complete detailed talks on their future relationship. The Prime Minister has been tight lipped on how she would like talks to proceed, although speculation has been mounting that she would side with the Chancellor and offer tens of billions of pounds to the EU during a transitional deal that could last up to three years. But she will look to shift the agenda away from Brexit at the UN summit in New York and said she would press again on the clamping down on modern slavery and terrorist use of the internet. Mrs May has stepped up pressure on other world leaders to do more to tackle terrorism in the wake of the Manchester bombing earlier this year. She led a discussion on counter-terrorism at the G7 summit in Sicily. Mrs May will also use the summit to hold bilateral talks with world leaders, including US President Donald Trump as well as European leaders, including the Dutch and Italian prime ministers, who are of key importance to Brexit. On Tuesday she will hold bilaterals with the UN Secretary General as well as the leaders of Switzerland, Turkey, Qatar and South Korea before hosting a round table discussion on modern slavery."

2017-09-18,A 72-year-old who lived a reclusive life with his sister could be imprisoned after he shot dead a man who tried to break into his caravan.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/reclusive-pensioner-faces-jail-for-fatally-shooting-an-intruder-11042539,"Reuben Gregory was woken by his sister's screams in the early hours of 12 June as someone attempted to break into the caravan they shared in the countryside near Heathrow. The pair attempted to fight the men off with a knife, but Gregory fired a double-barrelled shotgun through a hole in the door and hit 48-year-old Wayne Digby with a fatal shot to the chest. The man's alleged accomplice, Anthony Hearn, was also injured. Since the 1960s, Gregory and his sister Kathleen have lived a frugal life in the caravan - which is accessible only via a footpath and has no running water, phone line or electricity. After the shooting, he called the police from a neighbour's phone, telling them of an incident after a ""gang"" had attempted to break in. ""Yes I'm the one who's done it mate,"" he said. ""I've been attacked at the caravan."" Later investigation by the police revealed more weapons. A wooden mallet, cable ties, a bottle of bleach, a funnel and bolt crimpers were reportedly found in a bag near Digby's body, and a machete with Hearn's DNA in a nearby street. A search of Gregory's caravan uncovered a tennis ball full of flammable liquid and stuffed with a rag. Gregory was initially arrested on suspicion of murder, but the court ruled he was acting in self-defence. He pleaded guilty to having a firearm without a certificate at East Berkshire Magistrates' Court on Monday. Gregory said he had owned the weapon since the 1980s, when he and his family were hit by another break-in, and had been refused a licence because the caravan was not deemed a safe place to keep a firearm. Defence lawyer Umar Khan said Gregory ""fully accepts"" he kept a weapon without a certificate. ""He didn't want this trouble, he lives a frugal lifestyle, he and his sister,"" he said. ""Trouble came to him."" The illegal firearms charge carries a prison sentence of up to five years. Gregory will be sentenced at Reading Crown Court at a date yet to be set."
2017-09-18,It was just before 7am last Friday when a security camera attached to a house in Sunbury-on-Thames captured an image that sources have told Sky News may be the Parsons Green Tube bomber.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/what-journey-did-the-parsons-green-bomber-take-11042586,"It is only a couple of seconds long, but shows a person in a grey tracksuit and a red hat passing by on the street. In his hand, what appears to be a Lidl carrier bag - similar to the one which contained the Parsons Green device. It is believed to be a significant clue as detectives piece together the route taken by the alleged bomber. The image was recorded about 90 minutes before the bomb partially exploded on the District line train at Parsons Green. The spot where the CCTV image was recorded is just a few doors down from the house where counter-terror police have spent the last few days searching. The 18-year-old main suspect is believed to have stayed at the property on Cavendish Road, the home of well-respected local couple Ron and Penelope Jones, who have spent many years fostering vulnerable young people, including child refugees. I retraced the route the suspect is believed to have taken as he made his way towards the London Underground. Setting off from the house where the CCTV image was taken, I walked along Cavendish Road towards Sunbury railway station. The route took me along Vicarage Road, where another two CCTV cameras captured images, believed to be the same person seen on Cavendish Road. On one camera, he is seen changing the shopping bag over to another hand. If he was carrying the device, an indication, perhaps, of how heavy it was. It took me around 15 minutes to reach Sunbury station, walking at a steady pace. At the station, the trains to Wimbledon run regularly, every 15 minutes or so. Ten minutes later, I was on the train for a half-hour journey to Wimbledon, a key access point for the District line. Once on that Tube train, it was just five stops, and 15 minutes more before reaching Parsons Green. In total my journey took 1 hour and 10 minutes from the point of leaving Cavendish Road in Sunbury to arrival at Parsons Green station. Of course, we have no way of knowing what progress the suspect might have made on the same journey, but it seems there would have been plenty of time to prime a bomb. On the District line carriage with me is Peter Bleksley, a former senior detective, who helped set up Scotland Yard's covert surveillance unit. He told me: ""This is the journey we think the suspect took. But working on the timings, it's created about a 15 to 20-minute slot that we cannot account for. ""Did he use that time to sneak off and find himself a quiet spot, prime the device and set the timer? It's not only possible, I think it's probable."" Like me, counter-terrorism detectives will have retraced that journey, collecting vital CCTV along the way, as they build a case against the young man they suspect took the same route a few days earlier."
2017-09-18,"The Prime Minister said the decision was ""historic"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/parliament-supports-eu-withdrawal-bill-but-threat-of-brexit-rebellion-remains-11031615,"But it seems clear she also knows Parliament's approval for the EU Withdrawal Bill to proceed to its next stage was unmistakably conditional. To have marshalled enough parliamentary discipline to avoid any Conservative or DUP rebellion - while also seeing seven Labour MPs join them in the voting lobbies - will be savoured as a victory for Theresa May, not least on a matter as traditionally divisive for her party as Europe. But her acknowledgement on Tuesday morning that ""there is more to do"" is a significant understatement. Numerous Conservative MPs have expressed deep concern about the anti-democratic impact of the bill in its current form, and have made it abundantly clear there is a price to pay for their midnight support. As dawn broke, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon also gave signals the Government understood the terms, telling Sky News it was right that Parliament look into the detail of the bill, insisting ministers would be ""listening"". On the Conservative benches, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, former business minister Anna Soubry and former chancellor Ken Clarke were among those who chose not to pull the trigger on a rebellion on Monday night. However, the gun is still loaded and if serious changes are not made as MPs in committees dissect the bill line by line, it may yet be used. Indeed, up to 12 Tory MPs are believed to already be backing amendments tabled for consideration by committee. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has also made clear he intends to make the committee stage of the bill as testing for the Government as possible, despite the divisions within his own party that Monday night's vote exposed. Labour's amendments have already been tabled - focused on watering down the executive powers given to ministers to make law with limited parliamentary scrutiny, securing protections on human rights and environmental standards, and ensuring devolved powers remain devolved. But Sir Keir is also suggesting the bill may be already beyond repair - arguing the Prime Minister should have dropped it and started again, rather than burdening Parliament with the task of mangling the current form into something more acceptable to those who opposed its second reading. ""This is likely to cause delays and division in Parliament, and the Prime Minister has nobody to blame but herself,"" SIr Keir said. However, when it comes to the other opposition parties, it is not just the Government but Labour they hold in contempt. The Liberal Democrats accused Labour rebels of handing the government victory, while Plaid Cymru said Labour's lack of unity risked ""letting the Tories off the hook"". But Labour rebels seem far less likely at another crucial Commons vote due to be held once more in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Government is seeking to grant itself a majority on the selection committee - the body which chooses the make-up of MPs on the standing committees that scrutinise legislation - another step which the opposition parties have labelled a ""power grab"". The controversy lies in the fact that the Conservatives have no outright majority and therefore, critics say, the balance should be equally split between Labour and the Tories. Not so, argue the Government - pointing to the fact they have a majority on the floor of the House with DUP support that will see the motion pass, and therefore a majority on the selection committee is warranted to avoid logjams in the business of legislating. The critical question will be whether any so-called ""constitutionalists"" on the Tory benches, who grudgingly nodded the EU Withdrawal Bill to its next stage, feel this is a step too far."

In contrast, those who did not drink large quantities had a clear idea of their future job plans. The news comes as figures show that more teenagers are heading to university than ever before. Government guidelines advise men and women to drink no more than 14 units a week but this new research shows many students are drinking more. It also suggests that, the more they drink, the less likely they are to have clear career goals. Questioning 9,000 students and graduates, 24% admitted they drink excessively - more than 20 units a week. Of these, 63% had no idea what job they'll do after graduating. Some 58% drink once a week, no more than seven units. Of these, 76% were very optimistic about securing a job in the next six months. Ben Thompson, 21, who is a student at the University of the West of England, said: ""I think we're all the same: when we're hungover, we're more likely not to go to uni, miss our lectures."" The research was carried out by an organisation called Magnet.me which connects businesses with graduates. They said employers are often concerned graduates are not always properly prepared for work. Bilal Mahmood, from Magnet.me, said: ""The research essentially tells us that students - their social lives - do impact their future career options - and students should use that time in their university lives more wisely and prepare themselves properly for what the world of work is actually going to be like."" But students we spoke to disagreed on the impact that drinking at university can have on choosing a career. Jack Reed, a 20-year-old business student, said: ""You see a lot of people failing because they go out all the time. ""Drinking just becomes what they do all the time and it's quite easy to fall into that at university because you have so many businesses aiming alcohol at you."" But Jack Evans, 20, a property student, said: ""I went out and drank quite a lot at uni, but it might have helped that I knew what I wanted to do before I went to uni anyway."""
2017-09-18,Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has apologised for the inconvenience caused by a pilot rota blunder which has left hundreds of thousands of passengers unsure whether their flights will take off.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/call-for-full-list-of-ryanair-cancellations-11041922,"The budget airline conceded it had ""messed up"" the planning of pilot holidays and also blamed the cancellations on a backlog of crew leave, air traffic control strikes and weather disruptions. It estimated a bill of €25m (£22.1m) from compensation and lost fares. The no-frills carrier plans to cancel up to 50 flights a day over the next six weeks. There are lists of cancellations on its website. Ryanair said on Friday that the move to cut 2% of all scheduled flights would improve punctuality, which fell below 80% in the first two weeks of September, and give passengers certainty. ""We sincerely apologise,"" Mr O'Leary told Sky News, adding: ""It is clearly a mess, but in the context of an operation where we operate nearly 2,500 flights every day it is reasonably small. ""But that doesn't in any way take away the inconvenience we have caused to people whose flights have been cancelled."" The chief executive later told a news conference the flights to be scrapped up to the end of next month would mainly fall on routes which had multiple daily services. Mr O'Leary explained that it had taken time to identify those services as it had given priority to communicating with passengers due to travel in the short term - up to this Wednesday - first. The action has affected hundreds of thousands of passengers, who have complained of being left stranded and of their holiday plans going ""up in smoke"". One bride-to-be tweeted: ""#ryanaircancellations I'm really worried we fly out in two weeks to get married with 30 guests. No clue if our flight will be cancelled."" Another passenger wrote: ""Thanks #ryanair for making my Monday unusually exciting. Will my flight on Thursday be cancelled or not? #Shambles #ryanaircancellations."" #ryanaircancellations I'm really worried we fly out in two weeks to get married with 30 guests. No clue if our flight will be cancelled. Thanks #ryanair for making my Monday unusually exciting. Will my flight on Thursday be cancelled or not? #Shambles #ryanaircancellations Ryanair has offered those affected a refund or an alternative flight - as demanded by EU rules. Mr O'Leary explained that he did not foresee a repeat of the problem as it coincided with a shift in the company's holiday year - from its financial year to a calendar year - as demanded by regulators. Ryanair dismissed as a factor reports that it had lost 140 pilots to a Norwegian rival this year. Its share price was down by up to 3% at one stage on Monday before recovering just over half those losses."
2017-09-18,"North Korea has called increased UN sanctions a ""hostile act"", committed with the intention to ""physically exterminate"" its citizens.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-calls-un-sanctions-a-hostile-act-11041944,"In response to new sanctions - imposed after the country's sixth and most powerful nuclear test - the state has said it will now accelerate its nuclear programme. A foreign ministry spokesman for the North called the sanctions ""the most vicious, unethical and inhumane act of hostility"", intended ""to physically exterminate the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)"". Fresh measures - including banning textile imports and capping petrol supply - were unanimously imposed by the UN Security Council against Pyongyang one week ago. The mandate came after North Korea successfully fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan at the beginning of September, in defiance of existing sanctions. Pyongyang launched a second ballistic missile across Japan two weeks later. As North Korea responded to the sanctions on Monday, US bombers and jets have been conducting ""mock bombing drills"" over the Korean peninsula, in what was described by South Korea's Yonhap news agency as a further show of force. :: Trump labels Kim Jong Un 'Rocket Man' in jibe A pair of B-1B bombers and four F-35 jets flew from Guam and Japan, joining four South Korean F-15K fighters as part of the latest drill. China's foreign ministry spokesman has said that by sending ""threatening messages"" including ""warnings of military action"", the US is ""further complicating the situation"". The People's Daily, China's Communist Party newspaper, has argued that the sanctions need longer to take effect and should not be used as ""a tool for stifling the regime"". Russia and China have also begun naval exercises not far from the Russia-North Korea border, to the north of Japan. :: Kim Jong Un vows to complete North Korea's nuclear programme As the diplomatic situation continues to escalate, Germany's foreign minister has called for direct talks between the US, China and Russia. However, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has previously said diplomacy and dialogue will not work with Pyongyang, calling for the entire international community to apply more pressure. The fear remains that Kim Jong Un may soon develop the ability to target the US with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile. A UN General Assembly meeting will be held on on Tuesday, with North Korea's nuclear threat expected to be high on the agenda."
2017-09-18,"When the TV producer told me he would like a report on smuggling, I knew it would require full disclosure.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170919050826/http://news.sky.com/story/cross-border-game-of-ulsters-robin-hood-11041628,"The time had come to spill the beans, to tell the story of a man with a colourful reputation. His name was Sam, ""Sam the smuggler"". The newspapers called him ""Ulster's Robin Hood"". In the early 1950s, he began bolstering his modest income by exploiting the Irish border. It was tea at first, then butter and finally cigarettes. Evading the customs became his favourite pastime. He didn't always succeed. Sam was convicted of smuggling and twice served time in prison. At the height of his cross-border game, he was making £300 per week, a lot of money back then. But he was losing just as much - some £20,000 in fines and in the value of goods and cars seized. The thrill of the chase kept him going. He just got a buzz from his clandestine escapades. Accounts of him out-running police cars, on both sides of the border, have gone down in folklore. He came clean in the end and confessed to having been a professional smuggler for eight years. ""I am not ashamed of my past,"" he would say, ""everyone was smuggling when stuff was scarce. ""If only I had stopped"" when making more than losing, ""I would have been on top of the world. ""The one really big mistake of my smuggling career was when I decided to keep going."" Neighbours, with whom he had shared his loot, later persuaded him to run for a seat at Stormont. So the North Armagh constituency had an unlikely independent candidate on the ballot paper in the 1958 election. He didn't win but the honest confession of his shady past had gained him an unexpected admirer. When Sam died suddenly, aged 55, the Rev Ian Paisley turned up and participated in his funeral. On both sides of the political divide, there was a cultural ambivalence about subsistence smuggling. Fifty years after his death, people still talk about ""Sam the smuggler"" who stood for election. His campaign slogan: ""Thank heavens, here's Blevins."" Yes Blevins. Sam was my grandfather."

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court was shown video footage of his antics, which also included rummaging through a backpack to find a mobile phone. The car paint-sprayer, from Warrington in Cheshire, was filmed by an unmarked police patrol for 16 minutes as he rode northbound on the afternoon of 3 June. He was pulled over near Yarnfield by an officer from the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG). Zietowski, who admitted dangerous driving at a previous hearing, was also banned for 28 months. Originally from Poland, Zietowski told probation officers he was interested in stunt riding and was ""practising"" when he was spotted on the M6. But judge David Fletcher said his riding was ""hair-raising"", telling Zietowski he wanted the court to view the footage ""because I wanted to be sure that you had seen it"". ""You were showing off,"" the judge said. ""It was clearly driving which was over a lengthy period of time, involving speeds of up to 117mph, involving you twice removing the backpack. ""You were pulling wheelies on a number of occasions and at one point you were standing up with no hands on the handlebars. ""This was a piece of appalling driving."" Inspector Sion Hathway, from the CMPG, said: ""Such dangerous riding will not be tolerated on our roads. ""Zietowski showed a blatant disregard for the rules of the road and fellow motorists. ""His antics could have easily resulted in tragedy."""

Yahyah Farroukh, 21, is listed as living at an address in Stanwell, Surrey, which was searched by officers on Sunday. He was arrested at a fried chicken shop where he worked in Hounslow, west London, on Saturday night. Another 18-year-old was detained at Dover ferry port on Saturday morning. The younger man is suspected of planting the device, which exploded on a District Line train in London on Friday morning, injuring 30 people. Police said the two men are being questioned on suspicion of offences under the Terrorism Act. Both men are believed to have spent time in the care of Penelope and Ronald Jones, who received MBEs for services to children and families in 2010. Sky News understands that Farroukh has a number of links to the Joneses. He is linked with Penny Jones via Facebook and is also one of the people most recently registered to the address where the couple live. The Joneses have been highly respected foster parents for almost 40 years and looked after up to 300 children, including eight refugees. Farroukh is originally from Damascus, according to his Facebook profile. West Thames College, where he said he studied English, confirmed he was a student between 2013 and 2015. Suleman Sarwar, 43, who owns Aladdin's Fried Chicken on Kingsley Road, Hounslow, with his brothers, said Farroukh was arrested outside the takeaway after his shift finished at 11.30pm on Saturday. He said: ""He was very normal, like anyone else, like any other member of staff or member of the public, nothing unusual, nothing particular about him."" He said Farroukh ""wasn't religious but he wasn't not religious either"". ""He prayed just like every local Muslim in this community - they do their standard five prayers - that's what he did. So he didn't show anything which was out of the ordinary."" Leader of Spelthorne Borough Council Ian Harvey, whose ward is Sunbury East, said the 18-year-old suspect is understood to be an Iraqi orphan who moved to Britain when he was 15. Mr Harvey said: ""One thing I understand is that he (the 18-year-old) was an Iraqi refugee who came here aged 15 - his parents died in Iraq."" Mr and Mrs Jones' home in Sunbury-on-Thames was searched by armed police on Saturday morning and is still being examined by counter-terrorism investigators. Mrs Jones previously told the website of Elmbridge CAN, a group which works to settle refugees in the Surrey borough of Elmbridge, that the couple had fostered refugees from Iraq, Eritrea, Syria, Albania and Afghanistan. She said: ""People think the language will be a huge problem. But it isn't. Social services provide us with image cards. I make them repeat the words and after six weeks… they have a basic level of English to go to college. ""There are different cultural needs. But I always tell them to guide me and I'll do what I can... we respect each other and our beliefs. ""You have to have time. You need to be able to go to the Home Office with them. You need to get them a solicitor. You have to have patience too and remember they've been through a lot. ""But it's so rewarding. They're grateful to be safe, to have a bed to sleep in and to have food and (our support)... that's all they need."" Footage has emerged of a man in Sunbury carrying a Lidl bag, similar to the one the suspected device was hidden in, at 6.50am, reportedly leaving a house which police later searched. On Sunday afternoon, the UK's terror threat level was lowered from its highest point of 'critical' to 'severe'. Meanwhile, all but one of those injured in the attack have been able to leave hospital. As well as injuries from the fire, many people were hurt in the stampede of passengers trying to escape the bomb."

Bomb squad officers were at the scene throughout the day - but shortly after 5pm, police confirmed the object did not contain explosives and no terror link was suspected. Thames Valley Police said ""highly corrosive material"" had leaked across two lanes of the motorway - meaning further misery for evening rush hour drivers in the area. The northbound carriageway has reopened and some vehicles stranded on the southbound carriageway have been able to move away from the scene - but the southbound carriageway remains closed at junction 15. Police warned the clean-up operation would take a ""significant amount of time"". Images on social media showed a robot being used to investigate what appeared to be a bag or sack at the edge of the hard shoulder under the bridge. A smear or stain appeared to have spread partly across the hard shoulder away from the bag. The Highways Agency warned motorists to expect delays of at least an hour and recommended they use alternate routes. Chief Inspector Mark Lewis, from the Joint Roads Policing Unit for Thames Valley and Hampshire, said: ""There is no evidence to suggest that this is a terrorist-related incident. ""The object does not contain an improvised explosive device and therefore (there) has been no controlled explosion. ""However, the object contains a highly corrosive material which has leaked across lanes one and two, therefore the clear up process will take a significant amount of time. Chemical analysis is ongoing to ascertain what the substance within the object is. ""We apologise for the inconvenience caused to motorists but your safety, and the safety of our officers and the staff of our partner agencies, is paramount. We thank the public for their continued co-operation and patience. ""Motorists are advised to avoid the area, and the force and Highways Agency continue to divert motorists away from the scene.

Many motorists reported being stuck in traffic on the motorway for up to six hours and some pictures on Twitter showed people playing football and other sports on the clear side of the carriageway. Other images showed people bringing food and drink to those trapped in the jam. The A508 and A5 were also heavily clogged."

We know of 13 others who are still officially listed as missing but presumed dead Commander Stuart Cundy said the original figure ""may come down a little but"" due to investigations since the deadly blaze.

2017-09-19,A 72-year-old who lived a reclusive life with his sister could be imprisoned after he shot dead a man who tried to break into his caravan.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170920055436/http://news.sky.com/story/reclusive-pensioner-faces-jail-for-fatally-shooting-an-intruder-11042539,"Reuben Gregory was woken by his sister's screams in the early hours of 12 June as someone attempted to break into the caravan they shared in the countryside near Heathrow. The pair attempted to fight the men off with a knife, but Gregory fired a double-barrelled shotgun through a hole in the door and hit 48-year-old Wayne Digby with a fatal shot to the chest. The man's alleged accomplice, Anthony Hearn, was also injured. Since the 1960s, Gregory and his sister Kathleen have lived a frugal life in the caravan - which is accessible only via a footpath and has no running water, phone line or electricity. After the shooting, he called the police from a neighbour's phone, telling them of an incident after a ""gang"" had attempted to break in. ""Yes I'm the one who's done it mate,"" he said. ""I've been attacked at the caravan."" Later investigation by the police revealed more weapons. A wooden mallet, cable ties, a bottle of bleach, a funnel and bolt crimpers were reportedly found in a bag near Digby's body, and a machete with Hearn's DNA in a nearby street. A search of Gregory's caravan uncovered a tennis ball full of flammable liquid and stuffed with a rag. Gregory was initially arrested on suspicion of murder, but the court ruled he was acting in self-defence. He pleaded guilty to having a firearm without a certificate at East Berkshire Magistrates' Court on Monday. Gregory said he had owned the weapon since the 1980s, when he and his family were hit by another break-in, and had been refused a licence because the caravan was not deemed a safe place to keep a firearm. Defence lawyer Umar Khan said Gregory ""fully accepts"" he kept a weapon without a certificate. ""He didn't want this trouble, he lives a frugal lifestyle, he and his sister,"" he said. ""Trouble came to him."" The illegal firearms charge carries a prison sentence of up to five years. Gregory will be sentenced at Reading Crown Court at a date yet to be set."

Speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York for the first time, Mr Trump said: ""The United States is ready, willing and able (to act), but hopefully this will not be necessary."" The President also called on member states to work together to isolate Mr Kim until he stops his ""hostile"" actions, a reference to a series of recent ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests by Pyongyang. In what will be seen as a thinly veiled criticism of China, North Korea's major trading partner, Mr Trump said: ""It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict."" His comments visibly rattled some of the world leaders gathered before him, and one man in the audience was seen covering his face with his hands. Shortly before Mr Trump's combative address, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had appealed for statesmanship when it comes to North Korea, warning: ""We must not sleepwalk our way into war."" North Korea was not only the country to draw Mr Trump's ire, with the President also taking aim at Iran. He denounced the West's nuclear deal with Tehran as an ""embarrassment"" - the latest sign Mr Trump wants to rip up or renegotiate the landmark 2015 accord. He said the Iranian government was running an ""economically depleted rogue state"" whose prime export is violence. Mr Trump said world leaders ""cannot abide"" by the nuclear accord if it ""provides cover"" for Iran to eventually build its nuclear programme. Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was scathing in his response, labelling Mr Trump's remarks ""shameless"" and ""ignorant"". There were strong words on Venezuela, with the US President saying the country's socialist government had brought the once-thriving state to the ""brink of collapse"" - a situation Mr Trump described as ""completely unacceptable"". He said Washington had already imposed tough sanctions on the government and was considering what further action can be taken. Despite the forceful rhetoric, Mr Trump told world leaders the US does not seek to impose its will on other countries and will respect the sovereignty of other nations. ""I will defend America's interests above all else,"" Mr Trump said, echoing his campaign trail rhetoric promising an ""America first"" approach to the presidency. ""But in fulfilling our obligations to other nations we also realise it's in everyone's interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure,"" he added."

The data also showed discounters continuing to challenge the big four chains on market share. Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said: ""Own-brand sales are growing across all major food retailers but fastest at the discounters - Aldi and Lidl - and at the Co-operative, Iceland, M&S and Tesco. ""Looking at what shoppers are putting into their baskets suggests food retailers are helping shoppers manage the impact of inflation by offering different ranges of own-label alongside brands across many categories."" :: Cost of fashion pushes inflation to 2.9% Prices have been rising this year because the weaker pound since the Brexit vote has raised import costs. But the data also suggested that because of the ""very competitive"" market, companies are ""increasingly reluctant to pass on all of the rising cost of groceries to shoppers"". A separate study on the grocery market by Kantar Worldpanel measured grocery inflation at 3.2% in the 12 weeks to 10 September. Price rises are squeezing budgets because wages are only rising by an average 2.1% at the last official measurement. In a trading statement on Tuesday, the online grocer Ocado reported a 1.2% decline in its average order size. Group revenue rose by over 14% in the 13 weeks to 27 August. Its chief executive, Tim Steiner, said: ""Our industry-leading technology has continued to set the bar for customer service and satisfaction and we continue to grow sales at a rate significantly in excess of the average for our industry. ""Recent innovations include Ocado becoming the first UK grocer to offer its customers Amazon's Alexa voice-activated tool, meaning they can verbally modify their online grocery orders."" Kantar pointed to a slight hit to industry sales in August because of poor weather knocking demand for seasonal products but said that despite the blip the sector was currently enjoying its best run of sales growth for four years."
2017-09-19,It was just before 7am last Friday when a security camera attached to a house in Sunbury-on-Thames captured an image that sources have told Sky News may be the Parsons Green Tube bomber.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170920055436/http://news.sky.com/story/what-journey-did-the-parsons-green-bomber-take-11042586,"It is only a couple of seconds long, but shows a person in a grey tracksuit and a red hat passing by on the street. In his hand, what appears to be a Lidl carrier bag - similar to the one which contained the Parsons Green device. It is believed to be a significant clue as detectives piece together the route taken by the alleged bomber. The image was recorded about 90 minutes before the bomb partially exploded on the District line train at Parsons Green. :: Police get more time to question bomb suspects The spot where the CCTV image was recorded is just a few doors down from the house where counter-terror police have spent the last few days searching. The 18-year-old main suspect is believed to have stayed at the property on Cavendish Road, the home of well-respected local couple Ron and Penelope Jones, who have spent many years fostering vulnerable young people, including child refugees. I retraced the route the suspect is believed to have taken as he made his way towards the London Underground. Setting off from the house where the CCTV image was taken, I walked along Cavendish Road towards Sunbury railway station. The route took me along Vicarage Road, where another two CCTV cameras captured images, believed to be the same person seen on Cavendish Road. On one camera, he is seen changing the shopping bag over to another hand. If he was carrying the device, an indication, perhaps, of how heavy it was. It took me around 15 minutes to reach Sunbury station, walking at a steady pace. At the station, the trains to Wimbledon run regularly, every 15 minutes or so. Ten minutes later, I was on the train for a half-hour journey to Wimbledon, a key access point for the District line. Once on that Tube train, it was just five stops, and 15 minutes more before reaching Parsons Green. In total my journey took 1 hour and 10 minutes from the point of leaving Cavendish Road in Sunbury to arrival at Parsons Green station. Of course, we have no way of knowing what progress the suspect might have made on the same journey, but it seems there would have been plenty of time to prime a bomb. On the District line carriage with me is Peter Bleksley, a former senior detective, who helped set up Scotland Yard's covert surveillance unit. He told me: ""This is the journey we think the suspect took. But working on the timings, it's created about a 15 to 20-minute slot that we cannot account for. ""Did he use that time to sneak off and find himself a quiet spot, prime the device and set the timer? It's not only possible, I think it's probable."" Like me, counter-terrorism detectives will have retraced that journey, collecting vital CCTV along the way, as they build a case against the young man they suspect took the same route a few days earlier."

2017-09-19,One of Britain's biggest police forces is warning it has reached tipping point due to financial pressures and an ever-increasing workload.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170920055436/http://news.sky.com/story/burglaries-may-get-lighter-approach-as-police-chief-admits-staff-at-breaking-point-11044294,"The Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police admitted that crimes such as burglaries may no longer be treated as a priority because of increasing demands from mental health patients, missing people and the threat of online extremism. Talking about the budget cuts, Chief Constable Andy Marsh told Sky News: ""The number of officers in neighbourhood policing will be affected. ""There will be even less patrols by officers. Those things are all in jeopardy. ""One of the impacts is that in prioritising people's safety by attending to incidents like domestic violence, for crimes such as burglary and vehicle thefts we will have to take a lighter approach."" He added: ""Officers want the best. They're in policing to make a difference, but they're stretched to breaking point. They're not getting their days off, annual leave when they want it, so they're under huge strain."" Around 40% of the Avon and Somerset force have sought professional help for stress. PC Jay Harvey is one of those: he often works well over his hours for a team that is understaffed in Weston-super-Mare. PC Harvey told Sky News: ""It is very draining, going to mental health jobs, different incidents, especially traumatic ones. ""It does have an impact on us. I've noticed it in colleagues, I've noticed it in myself... I'm not afraid to say that I've sought counselling for one particular job that caused me a lot of stress. I've got no shame in saying that."" In Weston-super-Mare, the police emergency response team is clearly under pressure. In a three-hour period, there are three call-outs, all to patients with mental health issues. Comforting and reassuring them is a slow and time consuming process, meaning often there are no resources left for officers to provide a presence on the streets. The threat of extremism is also placing huge amounts of pressure on police forces up and down the country, which are already having to make millions of pounds of savings. The Dorset police force is facing a possible merger with neighbouring Devon and Cornwall, while earlier this year a detective inspector in the Midlands warned that many officers there were contemplating suicide because of the strain they were under. The Government said: ""We protected overall police spending in real terms since the 2015 Spending Review, with Avon and Somerset Police receiving £4.5m more in total direct resources funding this year compared with 2015-16, and we have announced additional funding for counter-terrorism policing."""

He revealed on Tuesday: ""It's a challenge I'm not taking lightly. Clearly not everyone can become a professional boxer but with the team of experts... and the drive I have to succeed, anything is possible."" Ferdinand has enlisted the help of Richie Woodhall, a former WBC super-middleweight champion who has worked with Britain's Olympic team, to make the transformation, with his journey set to be filmed for a documentary. Woodhall said: ""Style-wise, he's very raw and I'll have to develop this, which will take time, but he has all the natural ingredients, height and reach advantages over boxers in his weight division and definitely has potential to win a title in the future."" Ferdinand, who has lost his mum and wife to cancer in the last two years, was approached about making the switch by Betfair. The company is helping him qualify for his British Boxing Board of Control licence before he begins training and competing.

Thirty of their classmates and eight adults are still missing in the building, which like dozens of others has been turned into rubble. The 7.1 magnitude quake hit central Mexico hours after preparation drills were held on the anniversary of a devastating 1985 earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people in Mexico City. At least 248 people have been killed in Tuesday's quake, including 117 in the capital, authorities confirmed. At the school, TV pictures showed rescue teams working late into the night, using picks, shovels and their hands as well as heavy lifting gear in an attempt to find survivors. Earlier, panicked workers fled from office buildings and clouds of dust rose up from the crumbling facades of damaged buildings after the quake struck. As many as 44 buildings collapsed in Mexico City, according to mayor Miguel Angel Mancera. The US Geological Survey said the quake was centred near Raboso in Puebla state, 76 miles (123km) southeast of Mexico City. Officials asked people not to smoke in the streets of Mexico City - which has a population of 20 million - warning of possible ruptured gas pipes. Mexico City International Airport suspended operations, while electricity and phone lines were down in parts of the capital. The earthquake came less than two weeks after an 8.1 magnitude tremor in southern Mexico killed at least 98 people."
2017-09-19,"Theresa May believes internet companies need to go ""further and faster"" in fighting terrorism online.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170920055436/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-tells-tech-giants-to-go-further-in-fighting-terrorism-11043894,"The Prime Minister will co-host an event on preventing terrorist use of the internet at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. Ahead of the meeting, she said: ""We need a fundamental shift in the scale and nature of our response - both from industry and governments - if we are to match the evolving nature of terrorists' use of the internet."" During the talks, Mrs May will say: ""Industry needs to go further and faster in automating the detection and removal of terrorist content online, and developing technological solutions which prevent it being uploaded in the first place."" The event will also be attended by French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. Few are likely to disagree with Mrs May's remarks - including the technology giants themselves. Twitter, Facebook and Google's YouTube are already deploying artificial intelligence for exactly that reason - and are stepping up their efforts. Twitter alone has suspended nearly 300,000 accounts so far this year, with the company revealing 95% of those were detected automatically. A Number 10 source said: ""They have been doing something, but just not enough. These companies have some of the best brains in the world. ""They should really be focusing that on what matters, which is stopping the spread of terrorism and violence. We want them to break the echo chambers."" Far trickier is the issue of encryption. Sky News has learned WhatsApp rejected a UK Government request to access encrypted messages this summer. The inability to access terrorists' encrypted conversations is creating a ""black hole"" for security services, according to an intelligence source. Terrorists are ""frequent users of encrypted apps - specifically WhatsApp and Telegram"", the source said. ""It is crucially important that we can access their communications and, when we can't, it can provide a black hole for investigators,"" the source added. Encrypted messaging apps were used ahead of the terror attacks in Westminster, Manchester and London Bridge this year. The devices of one of the Parsons Green suspects have been recovered and are being investigated by intelligence agencies. Apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Apple iMessage employ end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent by users are scrambled by a code contained on the app on their phone or the phone itself. The systems are designed so that tech companies themselves do not even have access to the contents of a message. Sky News understands that WhatsApp co-operates with law enforcement to provide the metadata it does hold - the name of an account, when it was created, the last seen date, the IP address and associated email address. But the company argues it can't provide data is doesn't collect in the first place, including the contents of a message. In a statement on its website, the company states: ""Naturally, people have asked what end-to-end encryption means for the work of law enforcement. ""WhatsApp appreciates the work that law enforcement agencies do to keep people safe around the world. ""We carefully review, validate, and respond to law enforcement requests based on applicable law and policy, and we prioritise responses to emergency requests."" Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News: ""The way you have to think that the terrorist groups use these sorts of applications is the same way that all of us use encrypted applications, which is to plan our lives. ""So what you're increasingly seeing is that individuals are forming relationships or advancing relationships using these online communication methods. ""And they're using this to direct plots. We've had some instances where you've had individuals based in Raqqa, Syria, who are steering people to launch terrorist attacks from a distance and are communicating with them blow by blow using these encrypted communications."" Sky News understands 80% of investigations into terrorism and serious crime are now impacted by encryption. Terrorists themselves are now ""far more cyber savvy"" than they have been before, the security source told Sky News. At a meeting this summer, British officials asked WhatsApp to come up with technical solutions to allow them to access the content of messages - effectively, a back door. Cybersecurity experts say creating a back door for a government would weaken encryption for everyone, as it would be a prime target for hackers. But UK intelligence officials believe a compromise could be possible, pointing out cybersecurity isn't binary, and that services offer different levels of cybersecurity to deal with different levels of threats. The UK Government remains firm in its aspiration to obtain the unencrypted content of messages, under a proper warrant. The problem of obtaining access to the content of communications is larger than any one company. Telegram remains popular for dissemination of jihadist materials. Sky News observed channels - including those of al Qaeda's official mouthpiece and Abu Qatada, the radical cleric deported to Jordan - pumping out propaganda. Recruiters pump out content to lure the curious. That can inspire attacks - or they can go one further and use the same app to direct attacks on another continent. Telegram told Sky News it has a dedicated channel to remove terrorist accounts. ""As a result, jihadi channels usually go down within a few hours, long before they can reach any traction,"" the company said. Earlier this year, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft, along with other tech companies, announced they would form the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism in an attempt to tackle extremism on their platforms."

2017-09-19,Cyclist Charlie Alliston has been sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders' institution after a fatal crash in east London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170920055436/http://news.sky.com/story/cyclist-charlie-alliston-sentenced-to-18-months-11042070,"The 20-year-old former courier was cleared of manslaughter in August but found guilty of causing bodily harm by ""wanton and furious driving"". Kim Briggs, 44, was knocked over in February 2016 as she was crossing Old Street during her lunch break. The HR consultant suffered serious injuries and died a week later in hospital. Alliston, who shouted at Mrs Briggs as she lay in the road with ""catastrophic"" injuries, was riding a ""fixie"", a fixed gear bike with no front brakes, used by track cyclists. Sentencing Alliston at the Old Bailey, Judge Wendy Joseph QC told him his ""whole manner of driving"" caused the accident. She said: ""I am satisfied in some part it was this so-called thrill that motivated you to ride without a front brake, shouting and swearing at pedestrians to get out of the way. ""I've heard your evidence and I have no doubt that even now you remain obstinately sure of yourself and your own abilities. You were an accident waiting to happen. The victim could have been any pedestrian. It was in fact Mrs Kim Briggs."" Fixie bikes are not legal to use on the road unless they have been modified to have a front brake. Alliston, from south London, who was 18 at the time, argued that he was unaware of the law and that it would not have stopped him in time anyway. But crash investigators concluded he would actually have been able to stop if a front brake had been fitted. The former bike courier said he had shouted a warning, slowed down, and swerved to avoid a collision. He criticised Mrs Briggs online, claiming she was at fault before deleting his comments when he realised how serious her injuries were. During the trial he told the court his comments had been stupid and not thought through. The judge said he had not shown ""one iota"" of remorse at any stage. The offence Alliston was found guilty of is a piece of legislation from the 19th century, and Mrs Briggs' husband, Matthew, speaking outside court, demanded the laws be updated. He said: ""This case has clearly and evidently demonstrated that there is a gap in the law when it comes to dealing with death or serious injury caused by dangerous cycling. ""To have to rely on either manslaughter at one end or a Victorian law that doesn't even mention causing death at the other end tells us that there is a gap. The fact that what happened to Kim is rare is not a reason for there to be no remedy."" Matthew Briggs said he refused to live his life in anger and vowed to bring up the couple's 14-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter ""in a way that Kim would have been proud of, to honour my wife""."

But the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is poised to win seats in the Bundestag. For the first time in 60 years, a radical right-wing party will have gained a foothold in the nation's parliament. That would be a turning point to change the nature of political debate in Germany. A party with racist and nationalist tendencies may well become the country's official opposition if, as expected, Germany's two mainstream parties renew their coalition. That will give AfD the perks of parliamentary office to entrench its power and influence. The possibility is deeply alarming the German political establishment. And so is the campaign behind it. :: Will anti-Islam AfD win their first seats? AfD is using adverts that blend nationalist sentiment, xenophobia and misogyny in a way that defies the stodgy, staid conventions of political campaigning in Germany. In an offensive poke at the fact Muslims don't eat pork, there is the picture of a piglet under the provocative slogan: ""Islam? It doesn't fit in with our cuisine."" There's also the image of two women pictured from behind wearing bikinis, with the strapline: ""Burkas? We prefer bikinis."" Another features a smiling, pregnant white woman lying on her back on a picnic blanket in a field of flowers. It reads: ""New Germans? We'll make them ourselves."" For many, the imagery and message is unmistakably reminiscent of Nazi-era propaganda urging ""Aryan"" German women to reproduce in order to advance the so-called ""master race"". :: All you need to know ahead of the key European vote Social media is playing a key role as it did in recent French, British and US elections. Digital analytics company Newswhip reported AfD enjoying far higher engagement on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. One AfD ad promoted on Facebook uses a motif of bloody tyre tracks. Under date stamps recording recent European terror attacks, the title reads: ""The tracks left by the world Chancellor in Europe."" The ad is wrongly imputing blame on Ms Merkel's immigration policies for those terror attacks carried out using vehicles. The brains behind the iconoclastic ads is author Thor Kunkel, best known for writing a controversial novel about Nazis making pornography. But the ad strategy promoting his images is driven by US media company Harris Media, which has also worked for Donald Trump. They are combining to bring Germans a new style of political campaigning, fusing provocative imagery with radical messaging - propelled through state-of-the-art social media technology."

Asked if she believed there will be unity at a special meeting of her top ministers before the speech, the Prime Minister said: ""Yes, the Cabinet is absolutely clear about the destination we are aiming for in relation to our European negotiations."" Mr Johnson's decision to pen an explosive 4,000-word newspaper article setting out his own Brexit blueprint prompted calls for Mrs May to sack the Foreign Secretary over the breakdown in Cabinet discipline. But asked whether Mr Johnson should be dismissed, the Prime Minister said: ""Boris is doing good work as Foreign Secretary. He has been doing that here at the United Nations."" When questioned on what she wanted Mr Johnson to do, amid reports he could be set to resign from the Government, Mrs May added: ""What I want the Government to do is what the Government is doing, Boris and others, all very clear about the destination we have as a country. ""That is getting that deep and special relationship with the EU when we leave. ""But, a partnership that still leaves us, as the UK, free to make trade deals around the world and free to take control of our laws, our borders and our money."" Mrs May and Mr Johnson are yet to meet since his dramatic intervention, which some viewed as the Foreign Secretary paving the way for a leadership challenge, or to force the Prime Minister's hand ahead of a Brexit speech in Italy. Asked if she would find time to meet Mr Johnson while they are both in New York this week, Mrs May said: ""I will be seeing Boris at various stages during our time here, but of course we have got very busy programmes."" In his article, Mr Johnson had suggested Britain should not pay money to Brussels for access to the EU's single market beyond the date the UK leaves the bloc. The Prime Minister remained tight-lipped on Mr Johnson's demand, but referred to her Lancaster House speech last January in which she claimed the UK ""will not be sending huge sums of money into the EU"" after Brexit. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Johnson dismissed suggestions he could quit the Cabinet in protest if Mrs May offers too many concessions to the EU. Denying the Government is split on Brexit, Mr Johnson told reporters in New York: ""We are a nest of singing birds."""

He was nearly three times over the limit when he was pulled over by police at 2.10am on 1 September. The black Volkwagen Beetle that was stopped in Wilmslow, Cheshire, belonged to lettings agent Laura Simpson. Rooney's wife, Coleen, was away with the couple's three sons when he was arrested. When he was stopped he was found to have 104 microgrammes of alcohol in every 100ml of his breath. The limit is 35 microgrammes. Rooney's legal team had asked the judge at Stockport Magistrates' Court to consider not imposing a community order because of the charity work he undertakes. But District Judge John Temperley said he was ""not convinced"" that imposing a large fine ""would have the same effect"". He said: ""This was a serious offence that you admitted. You were driving a motor vehicle nearly three times the limit. ""You were carrying a passenger, which is an aggravating factor."" The judge added: ""You are a young man with no similar previous convictions. ""I have read a bundle of character references handed in on your behalf and they speak very highly of you as a person. I accept your remorse is genuine."" The Liverpool-born player, whose wife is expecting their fourth child, retired from international football in August having captained the Three Lions since 2014. His solicitor Michael Rainford said in court: ""Wayne Rooney wishes to express his genuine remorse for what was a terrible mistake, a terrible error of judgement on his part that evening. ""He realises he has not only let himself down very badly but his family."" In a statement issued after his guilty plea, tweeted out to his Twitter followers, he said he was sorry. He said: ""Following today's court hearing I want publicly to apologise for my unforgivable lack of judgement in driving while over the legal limit. It was completely wrong. ""I have already said sorry to my family, my manager and chairman and everyone at Everton FC.

But it was his direct threat to North Korea that will have got the world leaders gathered in New York to sit up and listen. ""If America is forced to defend itself and its allies,"" he said, ""we will have no choice but to destroy North Korea."" This was a direct threat of a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the north of the Korean peninsula. There is no other way to ""destroy North Korea"" or destroy any country. He's used similar language - ""fire and fury"" - in the past, but that was off the cuff. This was a carefully considered, direct threat that needs to be taken at face value - no matter how unpredictable, vain or downright silly Mr Trump's enemies may like to see him as. This was a threat made in the temple of international diplomacy - not in a moment of frustration or an ill-considered early morning session on Twitter. A regime he described as ""wicked"" was being supported, he said, by others (he did not name China nor Russia but thanked them for backing the last set of UN Security Council sanctions). But these two global powers will take him as seriously as he intends them to. Iran, meanwhile, was singled out. Not for destruction, but the deal done to suspend its development of a nuclear weapon in return for the lifting of sanctions. He warned that Iran could not continue to sponsor terrorist groups in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Assad regime in Syria. Yet Mr Trump stopped short of saying that he would abandon the Iran agreement. Venezuela's ""socialist dictator"" Nicolas Maduro was singled out for a cuffing too. This government, he said, should come under greater pressure from its neighbours and others in the region to bring about the restoration of democracy. In the case of both Iran and Venezuela, he went to some lengths to point out that the oil rich nations had impoverished their own people and appealed to those same people to choose between continued oppression and freedom. This may be a weakness. If the US calls on the ""oppressed"" to rise up, just as America freed itself of British rule, those who rise might expect help from the nation that said it would back them. It's not clear that Mr Trump understood that."

Yahyah Farroukh, 21, is listed as living at an address in Stanwell, Surrey, which was searched by officers on Sunday. The 18-year-old man is suspected of planting the device, which exploded on a District line train shortly after it pulled into the station. Magistrates have granted warrants allowing Farroukh to be held until Thursday, and the younger suspect until Saturday. The news came as CCTV footage emerged which appears to show the Parsons Green bomb suspect on his way to plant his homemade device. The video shows a figure dressed in grey carrying a white supermarket carrier bag about 80 minutes before the blast. Both Farroukh and the younger man are believed to have spent time in foster care with Penelope and Ronald Jones, who previously received MBEs for their services to children and families."

Users can avoid being locked out of their favourite apps by making sure they are updated before upgrading their operating system, which is optional. Apple has consistently warned about its intentions to get rid of 32-bit apps, and users have been presented with pop-ups telling them about the slowdown for a long time. Back when Apple released iOS 9, it explained that 32-bit apps could cause iPhones and iPads to perform a little worse than usual. :: What's the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit? The numbers 32 and 64 refer to the amount of information that a processor can handle. While a 64-bit processor may seem as if it could only cope with twice as much information as a 32-bit processor, it is actually capable of handling magnitudes more. A bit - a single unit of information - has two values, and can be either a 1 or a 0. Two to the power of 32 is just under 4.3 billion, but two to the power of 64 is more than 18 trillion. Theoretically, the number of values that a 64-bit processor could address is thousands of times larger than that of a 32-bit processor."

""It's likely moved - we don't know for sure that it was ever in one specific location,"" a British military intelligence officer told me in the Middle East. ""They're very, we call it 'operationally security aware' - so they know that if they're holed up in one building, doing one particular job from that building, then we'll soon find out. ""Key commanders will spread themselves around a place. ""We saw the movement out of Raqqa from these types of people much before the Raqqa operation really started in earnest."" Sky News has visited the Coalition Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC) this week. Based in Qatar, it controls all air operations above Iraq and Syria - it's so sensitive that it took us three years to get access. Live feeds from aircraft above Iraq and Syria are watched on big screens in a darkened hub - 700 military personnel from a number of different nations work out of here. Every morning, there is a conference call at 8.30am with Russian commanders using a dedicated secure line. This is to prevent any clashes over Syria. ""Red badge"" holders make the final decision to strike - that can sometimes take hours or just a few seconds. They are backed up by a team of analysts, policy advisers and lawyers who guide on the rules of engagement. Wing Commander Mark Still is a UK red badge holder in the CAOC. He explained: ""It's all about: is it a valid target? Is this going to have a military advantage for what we're trying to do here? ""If that is the case then we'll complete the strike. I don't think any deeper than that, to be honest. ""You always replay and think through - but if the hairs on the back of your neck are up, then actually we probably shouldn't be completing that strike in the first place."" In the last 12 months, the British rules of engagement have changed to allow pilots in the cockpit to strike without authorisation from the CAOC if they deem it necessary. The coalition is making progress reclaiming territory from IS in Iraq and Syria. It is estimated 75% of Raqqa has now been retaken. Recent airstrikes have been successful taking out senior leaders of IS - also known as Daesh - and the intensity has increased as the push on Raqqa has developed. Air Commodore Jonny Stringer, the senior British officer in Qatar, said: ""What we have seen recently is a number of key individuals in Daesh in their contributions to the fight in Iraq and Syria but also those who are enabling directly attacks in Europe, including the UK, and we've been able to go out and take them out."""
2017-09-19,"The pound may have been the worst performing major currency of recent times, but during the last three months it has been on an absolute tear.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170920055436/http://news.sky.com/story/a-rate-rise-conundrum-despite-sterling-surge-against-dollar-11036647,"Having traded as low as $1.2587 as recently as 21 June, it hit $1.3615 earlier on Friday, a gain of 8%. The pound is now trading against the greenback at levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU in June last year. That may not sound like much, given that the pound was trading at $1.50 before news of the Leave vote came through, but it does represent a significant recovery given that, around the time of the 'flash crash' on 7 October last year, some wild-eyed souls in the currency markets were talking seriously about the pound going all the way to $1.05. Against the euro, the gains have been less dramatic, reflecting the single currency's status as the best-performing major currency this year. Sterling's recent rally has merely brought it back to levels seen in mid-July. However, given that it was not that long ago that some people were speculating the pound might hit parity against the euro, it still represents a solid recovery. No one is talking any more about one pound being equal in value to one euro, at least, not outside the price-gouging currency exchange units at one or two UK airports. The reason for this rally, of course, is that the market is starting to price in an interest rate rise. A series of events have given this sentiment impetus, including news on Tuesday this week that consumer price inflation had hit 2.9% and Wednesday's news of another drop in the jobless rate to just 4.3%. This was followed on Thursday by minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee that revealed a majority of members believe that, in the absence of bad news, ""some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months"". That was reinforced in a speech on Friday by Gertjan Vlieghe, previously seen as one of the 'doves' on the MPC, in which he said ""the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when Bank rate may need to rise"". Mr Vlieghe added that this ""may be as early as the coming months"". These developments raise two questions. The first is the extent to which Bank Rate may have to increase. There is a school of thought in the market that the UK economy, in spite of the robust job creation figures, is losing momentum and may continue to do so while uncertainty persists over the Brexit deal that the UK is going to strike with the EU. That is certainly believed to be the view of Mark Carney, the Bank's governor. If shared by most other members of the MPC, it could mean monetary policy could merely be tightened to the extent of reversing last year's emergency rate cut made by the Bank following the Leave vote, bringing Bank rate back to 0.5%. This view, summed up in the phrase 'one and done', has it that the UK economy faces several years of uncertainty and that household finances are still quite fragile. The jobless rate may be falling but earnings growth is not keeping pace with inflation. Some UK households, it is argued, might struggle to meet their mortgage repayments even if there is a modest rate rise. Yet there is also a case for going further. Inflation is well ahead of the Bank's central target of 2%, unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and the UK economy is set to grow this year at around 1.7% which, while low, is not wildly out of kilter with the growth rates seen since the global financial crisis. Add to that the fact that the UK stock market is now into the eighth year of its current bull run and, on Wall Street, the rally has been going on longer than that. We are due another big stock market reversal together with the hit to confidence that would involve. Raising rates further now, it can be argued, will give the Bank scope to cut them again if it needs to rebuild confidence in the future. The other question is whether the MPC can be believed when it makes hawkish noises of the kind it has been this week. Mr Carney has, in the past, dropped heavy hints that interest rate rises are on the way - most famously at a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 and at Lincoln Cathedral in 2015 - only for him not to follow through with them. This led Labour MP Pat McFadden, then a member of the Treasury Select Committee, to dub him the ""unreliable boyfriend"". There are, however, alternatives to raising interest rates. One would be to start unwinding the Bank's £435bn worth of asset purchases undertaken since the financial crisis - Quantitative Easing in the jargon - which would have a similar impact to raising longer-term interest rates. Another would be to call a halt to the Term Funding Scheme, part of the stimulus package that was introduced after the Brexit vote, which aimed to ensure that banks passed on the full extent of the emergency rate cut. There is a view that all the scheme has done is fatten the profits of the banks and helped pump up another bubble in consumer borrowing - something about which the Bank itself has been worrying. A final measure that could be taken to stop consumer borrowing expanding dangerously could be taken by the Treasury, rather than the Bank, which would be to end the Help to Buy scheme. All the evidence suggests that this measure, introduced by the former Chancellor George Osborne in the hope of winning a few votes from would-be homeowners, has merely boosted the profitability of the housebuilders by stimulating demand for homes without doing anything to encourage building more of them."

Mr Simmonds was speaking following the news that the two suspects in custody over the Parsons Green terror attack had both arrived in the UK and had been fostered as part of their resettlement from Iraq and Syria. While not commenting directly on the case, he outlined a worry that he says is shared by many local authorities across the UK. ""Councils have long been raising concerns that the information we get is inadequate,"" he said. ""It was a big concern that was raised at the time when the Calais camp was closed last year and a significant cohort of children all arrived at the same time and that hasn't gone away. ""But clearly we are trying to ensure that we work with ministers to make sure the checks that are done at the border pick up those risks as best they can."" Mr Simmonds, who has responsibility for children's services in the London borough of Hillingdon next to Heathrow airport, added: ""I understand that the Home Office is in a difficult position. ""It won't always be able to do the kind of in-depth vetting, but in many situations we know from foster carers and others involved with those children is that the warning signs are there. ""Where we have those concerns at the point when they arrive we can be much more certain at protecting them or protecting other people that if it is kept confidential."" The details of when and how the Parsons Green suspects entered the UK have not been disclosed. Both are still in custody and have not yet been charged with any offence. The Home Office told Sky News individuals who seek asylum in the UK are subject to checks. It added that if the results of those checks are of concern, they are shared with the local authority."
2017-09-19,Doctors say bullets used in the popular toy Nerf guns can cause serious eye injuries.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170920055436/http://news.sky.com/story/doctors-issue-warning-over-toy-nerf-guns-11042842,"Accident and emergency medics from Moorfields Eye Hospital in London say they have treated three patients who have suffered internal bleeding as a result of being hit. Nerf toys are manufactured by Hasbro and include a range of guns, blasters, and bows and arrows aimed at children aged eight and over. The doctors say a 32-year-old man shot in the eye from eight metres away by a child with a Nerf gun suffered blurred vision and a red eye. A 43-year-old woman also complained of blurred vision and a red, sore eye after being shot in her right eye from a distance of one metre. And an 11-year-old boy, who was shot in his right eye from a distance of two metres, ended up developing swelling of the outer and inner layers of the eye. Writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the doctors said that while all three recovered their sight fully, the ability of Nerf guns to cause problems was worrying and could lead to long-term vision loss. They said: ""This case series emphasises the seriousness of ocular injury from Nerf gun projectiles and calls into consideration the need for protective eyewear with their use. ""It also calls for reconsideration of the safe age limits for Nerf gun use in children."" The team also raised concerns about unbranded Nerf gun bullets, which they say can be harder than branded ones. The authors said that, from the cases seen, they are unable to establish any safe distance for avoidance of significant eye trauma. A spokeswoman for Hasbro said: ""Product safety is of utmost concern at Hasbro. ""Nerf products are designed based on years of consumer insights and research and undergo rigorous reviews and testing to assure that they are safe and fun to play with and meet or exceed global standards and regulations. ""Nerf foam darts and foam rounds are not hazardous when used properly. ""Consumers must never aim Nerf blasters at a person's eyes or face, should only use the foam darts and foam rounds designed for specific Nerf blasters and never modify darts or blasters."""

He would then pair these with antique revolvers and weapons purchased from legitimate firearms dealers and auctions across the country. The 22-year-old was arrested on 20 February after arranging for a hand grenade to be delivered to his home in Bordesley Green, Birmingham. Intercepting the parcel, officers replaced the contents with a non-explosive substitute before allowing it to be delivered. Four revolvers and 15 rounds of ammunition were also discovered at the property. A second man, Nazim Hussain, 47, who helped store and distribute the weapons and ammunition, was jailed for nine years at Birmingham Crown Court. The judge described both men as being in the 'premier league' of firearms suppliers. Ammunition was smuggled into the UK via postal parcels and packets sent from Sweden in sophisticated vehicle concealments. Signed for at multiple addresses across Birmingham, the ammunition was then sold by Khan - along with the antique firearms - to organised crime groups across the UK. Officers described Khan as having ""no thought for where or how the weapons would be used"". One weapon was recovered fully loaded and in the hands of a Class A drug dealer who was stopped in a stolen vehicle during a West Midlands investigation. Two stun guns were also imported, disguised as a knuckle-duster and torch. Khan is known to have bought more than 50 revolvers and 1,600 rounds of ammunition over the course of two years, but police believe he could be linked to many more cases. Officers are urging anyone who bought illegal weapons from the men to either contact their local firearms licensing department or surrender any weapons to avoid a criminal conviction or possible custodial sentence.Anyone with information about illegally held firearms can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111."
2017-09-19,"Some people, who should probably know better, are describing Ryanair's current difficulties as a ""Ratner moment"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170920055436/http://news.sky.com/story/why-ryanairs-own-goal-is-no-ratner-moment-for-the-brand-11043192,"That, to say the least, is over-egging things. Is this hugely embarrassing to Ryanair? Yes. Is this going to hit its sales and profits this year? Yes. Is this going to damage the confidence of some customers to the extent that they will never again fly with the airline? Yes. But does this situation pose an existential threat to Ryanair? Absolutely not. Gerald Ratner, who ran a jewellery chain bearing his name, made some ill-judged remarks at an after-dinner speech to the Institute of Directors in April 1991 that knocked £500m from his company's stock market value. It almost collapsed in the aftermath and, within 18 months, Mr Ratner had left the business, which shortly afterwards changed its name to Signet Group. :: Ryanair passengers livid over cancellations The only thing that Ryanair's current turmoil has in common with the ""Ratner moment"" - an expression which has become shorthand for a catastrophic error of judgement that threatens the existence of a business - is that roughly the same amount of money, £500m, has been knocked off the airline's stock market value. However, this sum represented nearly 90% of Ratner's stock market value at the time, while Ryanair is a €20bn (£17.7bn) business. However much some financial commentators - most of whom seldom travel economy class, let alone fly with a budget airline - may fulminate, Ryanair's brand is robust and will survive this turbulence. Consumer attitudes have moved on since 1991. When Mr Ratner made his gaffe, describing some of his products as ""total cr**"", it was genuinely shocking. By contrast, Ryanair's mercurial chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has never pretended that the airline offered the last word in passenger comforts. For him, it has always been about the price. Offer the lowest seats in the business and people will travel with you, even when they have foresworn never to do so. Customers have accepted it. As long ago as 2002, Mr O'Leary was telling The Independent newspaper: ""Do we sometimes p*** people off? Of course we do. ""But 60% of the complaints we get are people looking for refunds of what everyone knows is a non-refundable ticket. And the answer to that will always be 'No, you're not getting a refund, we told you it was non-refundable, go away'."" He went further than this a year later when he told the Financial Times: ""We don't fall over ourselves if, say, they say 'My granny fell ill'. What part of no refund don't you understand? You are not getting a refund so f*** off."" Those claiming this latest crisis will bring down Ryanair should read the history books. The low-cost airline has gone through worse problems than this in the past. Back in 2001, when foot-and-mouth disease caused the cancellation of the Cheltenham Festival - the equivalent of a religious pilgrimage for tens of thousands of Irish racing fans - Ryanair refused to give refunds unless customers had bought a changeable ticket. Mr O'Leary himself is a racing nut who owns a number of previous winners at Cheltenham and who well understands the importance of the event to customers in the market that first helped Ryanair become the world's most profitable airline. He knew this would make Ryanair unpopular but stuck to his guns. And the airline came through it. There have been numerous other incidents down the years. The only time that Ryanair has softened its attitude towards customer service came in 2013 when easyJet, a rival that Mr O'Leary had routinely disparaged, began offering services such as allocated seating. It quickly won over millions of people who were avoiding Ryanair due to its perceived poor service. So Mr O'Leary, as any good businessman does, adapted to the demands of the market. Ryanair became, in his words, less ""irritating and confrontational"", making changes such as improving its website, offering allocated seating itself and reducing penalties for customers - previously described as ""stupid"" - who forgot to print out their boarding passes. Being ""nice"" to passengers paid off, and Ryanair soon made up ground lost to easyJet. By this summer, it was even complaining that it had become a ""victim of our own niceness"", suggesting customers were abusing the increased on-board baggage allowances it was now offering. These recent flight cancellations imply a return to the bad old days. They are not. They are more a result of the tight margins for error in the way businesses like Ryanair are now run. The so-called ""just in time"" supply chains used by supermarkets are another example. If something goes wrong, problems can swiftly escalate. In Ryanair's instance, it appears that changing the basis on which pilot and crew's flying hours were calculated from an April-to-March basis to a calendar year has led to shortages of pilots, possibly exacerbated by defections of some pilots to the rival airline Norwegian. But the cancellations do need to be put in context. As Mr O'Leary has pointed out, 2,000 flights sounds like a lot, but less than 2% of Ryanair's customers will suffer disruption. ""In the context of an operation in which we operate 2,500 flights every day, it is reasonably small,"" he has said. Analysts at stockbroker JP Morgan Cazenove told their clients this morning to buy the shares following Monday's sell-off. They added: ""While the cancellations are likely to take a toll on Ryanair's reputation, our long-term bullish thesis remains intact."" With the shares in positive territory this afternoon, that looks to have been good advice. This is a short-term row that will blow over."
2017-09-20,More than 200 people have been killed in an earthquake in central Mexico - including at least 21 children whose school collapsed on them.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170921061835/http://news.sky.com/story/mexico-city-hit-by-71-magnitude-earthquake-on-anniversary-of-1985-disaster-11043859,"Dozens of buildings has been reduced to rubble, forcing thousands of volunteers and emergency personnel to scrabble through the debris in a frantic search for survivors. The 7.1-magnitude quake hit hours after preparation drills were held on the anniversary of a devastating 1985 earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people in Mexico City. The death toll has yo-yoed as authorities have struggled to keep up with the number of bodies being brought into hospitals and morgues. But the latest official figures put the number of dead at 216, with fears it could rise further as more bodies are discovered. At the collapsed Enrique Rebsamen school in Mexico City, 25 bodies - all but four of them children - have been recovered, the federal education department said. Thirty children and eight children are still missing. A volunteer rescuer managed to squeeze into a classroom after teams created a cavity into the ruins of the building. He found four bodies, but no survivors. There have been reports of trapped children send WhatsApp messages from underneath the rubble. President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has visited the school, appealed for calm, saying: ""The priority at this moment is to keep rescuing people who are still trapped and to give medical attention to the injured people."" The US Geological Survey (USGS) said Tuesday's quake was centred near Raboso in Puebla state, 76 miles (123km) southeast of Mexico City, but the shaking in the capital was almost as intense. :: Why are there so many earthquakes in Mexico? Panicked workers fled from office buildings and clouds of dust rose up from the crumbling facades of damaged buildings as the quake struck. Amid the screams and shock, terrified parents ran to cradle their children in the worst affected areas of Roma, Condesa and Doctores. At patches of rubble where floors had pancaked on top of one another, cheers and applause occasionally broke out as rescuers pulled people to safety. At others, signs saying ""silencio"" were held up as emergency personnel thrust themselves into hollows in the debris as they tried to hear if anyone was trapped. One of those rescued, Alma Gonzalez, said: ""It was a very hard hit that went down and then I went to find my child and I couldn't so I started to WhatsApp and I was trapped on the third floor... and the people in the house next door helped me get out with a ladder... I am just grateful to God that we are here for something."" Officials asked people not to smoke in the streets of Mexico City - which has a population of 20 million - warning of possible ruptured gas pipes. Mexico City International Airport suspended operations, while electricity and phone lines were down in parts of the capital. The earthquake came less than two weeks after an 8.1 magnitude tremor in southern Mexico killed at least 98 people. Amid the latest quake, the Popocatepetl volcano near the capital had a small eruption, flattening a church on its southern slopes and killing 15 people attending a mass."

Talking about the budget cuts, Chief Constable Andy Marsh told Sky News: ""The number of officers in neighbourhood policing will be affected. ""There will be even less patrols by officers. Those things are all in jeopardy. ""One of the impacts is that in prioritising people's safety by attending to incidents like domestic violence, for crimes such as burglary and vehicle thefts we will have to take a lighter approach."" He added: ""Officers want the best. They're in policing to make a difference, but they're stretched to breaking point. They're not getting their days off, annual leave when they want it, so they're under huge strain."" Around 40% of the Avon and Somerset force have sought professional help for stress. PC Jay Harvey is one of those: he often works well over his hours for a team that is understaffed in Weston-super-Mare. PC Harvey told Sky News: ""It is very draining, going to mental health jobs, different incidents, especially traumatic ones. ""It does have an impact on us. I've noticed it in colleagues, I've noticed it in myself... I'm not afraid to say that I've sought counselling for one particular job that caused me a lot of stress. I've got no shame in saying that."" In Weston-super-Mare, the police emergency response team is clearly under pressure. In a three-hour period, there are three call-outs, all to patients with mental health issues. Comforting and reassuring them is a slow and time consuming process, meaning often there are no resources left for officers to provide a presence on the streets. The threat of extremism is also placing huge amounts of pressure on police forces up and down the country, which are already having to make millions of pounds of savings. The Dorset police force is facing a possible merger with neighbouring Devon and Cornwall, while earlier this year a detective inspector in the Midlands warned that many officers there were contemplating suicide because of the strain they were under. The Government said: ""We protected overall police spending in real terms since the 2015 Spending Review, with Avon and Somerset Police receiving £4.5m more in total direct resources funding this year compared with 2015-16, and we have announced additional funding for counter-terrorism policing."""
2017-09-20,Boris Johnson jogged into the lobby of the W Hotel in downtown New York on Tuesday and straight into the cameras of a mini-press pack waiting to interview the Prime Minister on the 18th floor.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170921061835/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-and-theresa-may-a-nest-of-singing-birds-over-brexit-at-least-for-now-11044323,"A sweaty, but sitting, target, we pressed the Foreign Secretary on rumours that he might resign over the Prime Minister's keynote Brexit speech this Friday: a story that has refused to die ever since he took it on himself to pen a 4,200-word treatise on what Mrs May's Brexit deal should look like. Going to resign? ""No, no of course not,"" smiled the red-faced Mr Johnson. He and the Prime Minister were ""a nest of singing birds"". A (sweaty) hand on my shoulder: ""It's all going to be fine."" They hadn't, he admitted, spoken but there was a concerted effort from No 10 and the Foreign Office to put on a united front. Up on the 18th floor, a rather more put-together Prime Minister laughed when I told her about the impromptu press conference in the lobby. If she felt rattled by her Foreign Secretary's antics over recent days she was trying to give the impression at least that she had moved on. Should he resign? Are you going to sack him? ""Boris is doing a good deal as Foreign Secretary, he's been doing that at the UN,"" said Mrs May. ""Boris and others are all clear about the destination we have and that is getting a deep and special partnership with the EU before we leave."" :: May expects Johnson to remain in Cabinet Emphatic nos from both then, on Mr Johnson's exit from high office. He was a little more equivocal the day before. It's likely that behind-the-scenes some envoy, perhaps Theresa May's newish chief of staff Gavin Barwell, has offered the Foreign Secretary some reassurances that she will not try to fudge Brexit. Perhaps she has offered reassurances that she is not planning to advocate a Swiss-style Brexit deal, whereby the UK permanently pays money into EU coffers long after it has left in order to get access to the single market. After all, Mr Johnson has publicly made this a red line. Perhaps she has offered reassurances that she won't pay an exorbitant Brexit bill. Mr Johnson - who used to insist Britain shouldn't pay a bean on leaving - now agrees that the UK should ""settle its accounts"". So perhaps, as the FT has reported, she'll offer up €20bn to fill the Brexit back hole. Difficult for Brexiteers to swallow perhaps - but it's a lot less than the €60bn that was being bandied around Brussels a few months back. The Prime Minister has a difficult balancing act to play as she prepares to deliver a ""significant"" speech in Florence. :: Why Theresa May's Florence speech is critical She must do enough to break the three-month impasse in Brexit talks over the terms of the divorce (the money) so she can move onto discussions about a future trading relationship between the EU and the UK. But she must also avoid angering the likes of Mr Johnson and other Brexiteers by trying to carve out a Brexit that they cannot accept. The fact that Mr Johnson says he's staying in post, and Donald Tusk, the President of the European Commission, is coming for talks at No 10 just days after the Florence address suggests Mrs May is somehow managing to walk that tightrope - for now. But we'll have to wait for the fallout from Friday to find out whether she can stay on."

A crowd of parents waiting outside claimed two families have received WhatsApp messages from two trapped girls. The newspaper El Universal reported that one trapped girl, Fatima, sent a WhatsApp message to her relatives saying: ""I'm fine, I'm with four other trapped children, help us, we're thirsty."" It is not known if Fatima is among the 30 or so children who have been rescued so far from the Enrique Rebsamen School, which like dozens of other buildings in Mexico City has been turned to rubble. Up to 30 youngsters and eight adults were initially declared missing in addition to those who were known to have died. TV pictures showed rescue teams working in the dark, using picks, shovels and their hands as well as heavy lifting gear in an attempt to find survivors. One boy who was pulled out alive by a soldier, named Victor by El Universal, said he was thirsty but could barely breathe after being crushed by a fence. A volunteer rescue worker, 29-year-old doctor Pedro Serrano, crawled through a crevice in the debris and made it into a classroom. He found the bodies of three more people - two adults and a child - which he was unable to remove because it was too dangerous. He said: ""We dug holes, then crawled in on our bellies. We managed to get into a collapsed classroom. We saw some chairs and wooden tables. ""The next thing we saw was a leg, and then we started to move rubble and we found a girl and two adults a woman and a man."" Anxious relatives have described their fears as they grow increasingly concerned. ""They keep pulling kids out, but we know nothing of my daughter,"" said 32-year-old Adriana D'Fargo, whose seven-year-old was missing. The doctor said he had not given up hope of finding more children alive. ""We can hear small noises,"" he said. ""We don't know if they're coming from above or below - from the walls above, or from someone below calling for help."" Occasionally, the volunteers and emergency personnel at the school have been asking for silence so they can listen for signs of life. Silently, as they continue to work way into the night, they hold their fists in the air in a gesture of hope and solidarity."
2017-09-20,"Scotland's Universities say they are suffering ""financial stress"" under current funding arrangements. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170921061835/http://news.sky.com/story/scottish-universities-under-financial-stress-with-calls-for-more-investment-11045781,"Universities Scotland, which represents the top educational institutions north of the border, has called on the Scottish Government to balance its policy of no student tuition fees with appropriate investment, warning that Scotland's world-class academic reputation is at stake. Alistair Sim, the Director of Universities Scotland, told Sky News: ""It think we're seeing that there's some financial stress in the system at the moment. ""We're certainly making an argument to Scottish Government that if you really want to make sure that we sustain our position, contributing as much as we can to inclusive economic growth, you're going to have to invest. ""Let's make sure, at least in real terms, we're maintaining investment at current levels, even in current difficult circumstances.""Mr Sim called the no-fees policy a ""fair political choice"", but added: ""Let's make sure that we're backing that up with the resources to keep Scottish higher education really world class, really competitive and as widely accessible as we can make it to the people of talent."" In Scotland's higher education establishments, students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have to pay tuition fees of around £9,000. Only Scottish students studying for a first degree benefit from the policy of free tuition north of the border, as well as students from European Union countries. This is in accordance with EU law - it's only within the United Kingdom that the Scottish Government can differentiate. Sky News gauged the view on either side of the 'feed divide' among students starting their 2017/18 academic session at the University of Edinburgh. Ruby Kelman, studying French and Italian, is from Leicester and so is paying tuition fees. She said: ""It creates a strange dynamic at university. It's lots of people paying different amounts - some none, some loads for exactly the same education and that feels a bit strange and it's a bit tense sometimes."" Ben Cunningham, studying electronics, is from the Scottish Borders and so pays no fees. He said: ""I think that makes sense. If I want to go to an English university, I have to pay £9,000 a year. ""If it was free for the rest of the UK, most English students would come here and there wouldn't be any places left. It's how you spend your money - the Scottish Parliament has a budget, it chooses to spend some of it on tuition fees. Westminster could easily do the same for English universities."" Andrew Dickie is studying for a Masters in International Development, for which he's paying tuition fees. As a native of Edinburgh, he didn't pay fees for his undergraduate degree. He said:""I wouldn't have been able to go to university had I not had free tuition fees. It is a Scottish Government piece of legislation that allows Scottish students to come to University. ""It's a devolved issue and that's what they've chosen to legislate on. It's up to the UK government if they want to introduce that for everyone else."" Eve Brandon, studying history, is from Taunton in Somerset and so pays fees. She said: ""I always expected to pay fees, so it's not really in the forefront of my mind. I'm generally okay with it. ""The Scottish degree system makes up for it. I guess it is unfair and it does create a dynamic - having conversations about money do take on a certain slant when it comes to tuition fees but, other than that, I don't think it's my biggest problem with the education system."" Critics of Scotland's SNP Scottish Government point to studies that have shown poorer students are borrowing most student loans and that fewer of them end up in university education compared to south of the border. Currently, the bursary available to students from households with an income lower than £18,999 is £1,875. Scottish Labour's Iain Gray MSP told Sky News: ""The problem we have with the SNP is yes, they support free tuition but they haven't really increased funding to universities and, worse than that, they've slashed in half the grants which are available for low-income students.""Shirley-Anne Somerville MSP, Scotland's education minister, defended her Government's record. She said: ""While the UK government has ended bursaries for students within England, we have increased the threshold for bursaries in Scotland. ""We're 10 years into Government and we are already taking concerted effort to ensure that we're dealing with debt in students, that's why we're looking to increase and have increased the amount of bursary for the poorest students. But again, we're always challenging ourselves to see what more we can do. ""That's why I've asked an independent review to look at bursaries, not within just within higher education but also in our colleges as well. We're very keen to support our colleges and their higher education income as well."""

Later this year, a trial will rule on the underlying legal dispute over the council's bid to shed staff and change working patterns. A number of bin workers attended the two-day hearing, with one hailing the judge's ruling as ""fantastic"" and a ""massive victory"". Unite's assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said the ruling left the authority's ""unfair and unjust plans in tatters"". Mr Beckett said: ""This judgment will be a huge relief to Birmingham's bin workers, who in just a matter of weeks were facing losing their job or pay cuts of up to £5,000 a year. ""As part of the ruling, Unite will suspend its industrial action until the matter is put before a full court hearing at a later date."" The union also repeated calls for Stella Manzie, the council's chief executive, to resign. A council spokesperson said: ""We obviously accept today's ruling which will mean further consideration by the courts. ""The council wants to offer the best possible refuse service for citizens and wants to work with Unite and all the other unions to do this. ""We remain committed to resolving the dispute as quickly as possible and we hope Unite will support us in doing this."" The High Court judge described the dispute over Birmingham's bin services as ""extraordinary and astonishing"". Mr Justice Fraser said there was a ""schism"" within the council, with officers and the executive ""positively working against one another in some respects"". ""Neither party emerged from this remarkable saga with any credit,"" the judge said. Last week, John Clancy quit as leader of the council claiming ""ill-informed"" media speculation about the strike was harming the local Labour party. At the beginning of September, a previous suspension of the strike was ended after a draft agreement between union leaders and the council broke down. During the strike, piles of waste mounting in some parts of Birmingham led to a feeding frenzy for rats, maggots, flies and other vermin."
2017-09-20,"The burden of finding a solution to the issue of the Irish border after Brexit lies firmly with the UK Government, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170921061835/http://news.sky.com/story/finding-irish-border-solution-after-brexit-lies-with-uk-verhofstadt-11044687,"Guy Verhofstadt spoke about the issue in Belfast at the start of a two-day fact-finding mission. Reiterating the EU stance, he said ideas to solve the problem of the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland proposed by the Government so far were not acceptable. In an interview with RTE Radio One, he said: ""There are possibilities, for example you could imagine one proposal on the table that Northern Ireland continued to be part of the customs union and even of the single market. ""The point is it is the UK Government that has to come forward with such unique solutions."" He said a ""resurrection of a hard border in Northern Ireland"" is ""not in the interests of business in Northern Ireland and Ireland, neither in the interests of the citizens"". Mr Verhofstadt, an MEP who liaises between the EU negotiating team and the European Parliament, met with Northern Ireland's political leaders. His trip also includes a visit to Irish border communities that harbour concerns about the impact of Brexit, and a stop in Dublin to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and address a special joint sitting of a number of Irish parliamentary committees. In Stormont hearing all political forces involved in finding a workable solution for the Ireland issue in #Brexit talks Mr Verhofstadt said he was sceptical of the UK's position paper on the border post-Brexit, which suggested there would be no need for physical customs checks on the frontier even if the UK is outside the customs union. The Whitehall paper effectively recommended no changes to the current arrangements, with the Government saying it wanted a seamless and frictionless frontier. Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said the proposals are ""unacceptable"". After talks at Stormont, MEP Diane Dodds, who was part of the Democratic Unionist delegation meeting with Mr Verhofstadt, said Northern Ireland could not be treated differently from the rest of the UK. She took Mr Verhofstadt to task for saying the onus of a solution rests with the UK. ""These talks will only be successful if the two sides are willing and able to talk through a sensible solution to Brexit,"" she said. ""Soundbites like this ... will not reflect the reality of the solution when it comes."" Sinn Fein's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said after the talks: ""We've made very clear to him today the issues which we need to see - we need to remain in the customs union, we need to have access to the single market, we need to see no return to hard borders and to see citizens have access to the European Court of Justice."" Mr Verhofstadt's visit comes shortly before a crucial summit in Brussels next month, when leaders of the EU27 will decide whether ""sufficient progress"" has been made in the first phase of Brexit talks - and determine whether the negotiators can move on to discussing a future relationship. The EU has insisted progress has to be made in three key areas: citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligations and the shape of the Irish border. Mr Verhofstadt, who refused to speculate on Theresa May's upcoming Brexit speech in Florence, said there remained a ""dispute"" on the exit bill and that there were ""big differences"" in terms of both sides' position on citizens' rights."

An assessment was made that concluded he did not pose a risk to those working in the game. However, tonight the FA released a statement saying the full report of that probe was only brought to their attention last week and shows ""clear evidence of inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour by a coach"". The statement said: ""The Football Association can confirm that Mark Sampson's contract as England Women's Head Coach has been terminated with immediate effect. ""Prior to taking charge of the national team in December 2013, Mark was manager of Bristol Academy. In 2014, safeguarding allegations were made against him about his time with Bristol. The safeguarding assessment was that he did not pose a risk working in the game. ""However the full report of that investigation was only brought to the attention of the current FA leadership last week and it is our judgement that it revealed clear evidence of inappropriate behaviour by a coach. It is on this basis that we have acted quickly to agree a termination of Mark's contract."" The 34-year-old has been at the centre of discrimination allegations made by Chelsea Ladies and England striker Eniola Aluko. Sampson denies the claims and was cleared by two investigations of any wrongdoing. The FA said it stood by the findings and says no evidence of wrong-doing was found. It added: ""We will continue to support the independent investigation as it reviews the recent evidence presented to it and publish any new findings and recommendations."" FA bosses face a parliamentary inquiry over their investigations after Aluko initially made ""bullying and harassment"" allegations against Sampson. Aluko and fellow England forward Lianne Sanderson have been asked to give evidence at a select committee hearing in October. Minister for Sport Tracey Crouch said: ""This situation is a mess and raises very serious questions about whether the historic processes that the FA had in place around the recruitment of coaches were appropriate, for something like this to have been missed. ""The FA are right to have taken action but reassurance is needed to make sure this does not happen again at any level of coaching."" Sampson has managed the Lionesses since 2013, leading them to third place at the 2015 Women's World Cup. On Tuesday, the team beat Russia 6-0 in a World Cup qualifier at Tranmere Rovers' Prenton Park. He was appointed England boss in December 2013, succeeding Hope Powell to become the second permanent manager of the England Women's team."
2017-09-20,The widower of a mother-of-two who was knocked over and killed has welcomed the announcement of a Government review into dangerous cycling.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170921061835/http://news.sky.com/story/government-to-consider-death-by-dangerous-cycling-offence-11045771,"The Government has said it will conduct an urgent review into whether cyclists who put lives at risk should be subject to laws equivalent to those applied to drivers. Ministers will look at creating a new offence for cyclists comparable to causing death or serious injury by careless or dangerous driving. It follows the high-profile death of mother-of-two Kim Briggs, 44, who was knocked over and killed by cyclist Charlie Alliston, 20, in east London last year. Alliston, whose fixed-wheel track bike had no front brakes, was cleared of manslaughter but sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders' institution after being found guilty of bodily harm by ""wanton or furious driving"" - an obscure 19th century offence. Mrs Briggs' widower Matthew said the case highlighted a ""large gap"" in the law. ""I'm very grateful to the Government that they've been so swift and so responsive in calling for this urgent review,"" Mr Briggs told Sky News. ""What we're calling for is for laws of causing death and serious injury by dangerous cycling and careless cycling - much the same as they are for drivers for other vehicles."" In 2015, two pedestrians were killed and 96 seriously injured after being hit by a bicycle, while every year more than 100 cyclists are killed and more than 3,000 seriously injured on British roads. This man wants a change to the law on dangerous cycling. His wife was killed by a cyclist in east London last year pic.twitter.com/GMepWO83Vf The Government's review will also consider wider improvements for cycling road safety. Transport minister Jesse Norman told Sky News the review will be organised in two stages. The first part will be focused by whether there is a proper remedy in law for a crime of bodily harm or death inflicted by a cyclist, as highlighted by Mrs Briggs' case. The second will look at ""wider questions that balance all interests of pedestrian, cyclists and motorists"". ""We want to be sure that all the things we can do to improve cycle safety and all well-being of all road users can be wrapped up together in one review,"" Mr Norman said, adding the review would not discriminate against cyclists. Mr Briggs said the campaign was not meant to be anti-cyclist, but an attempt to remedy a gap in the law. ""Kim is not the first person that has been killed in this way, "" he said. ""And very sadly, I don't think Kim will be the last. ""I acknowledge it's very rare. But just because something is rare doesn't mean to say there shouldn't be a remedy in law."" For him, he said, it is also a way to move forward and ""do something positive out of something so negative"". ""I don't want to allow anger into our house. Kim was a real fun-loving woman,"" he said. The Government will take independent legal advice on the introduction of a new offence for cyclists and hopes to reach a decision early next year. A wider review of road safety issues for cyclists will consult cycling groups and the general public."

Cameron announced he was reuniting the first film's two main actors, Schwarzenegger and Hamilton, in an effort to change the perception of gender roles in action films. ""As meaningful as she was to gender and action stars everywhere back then, it's going to make a huge statement to have that seasoned warrior that she's become return,"" he said. ""There are 50-year-old, 60-year-old guys out there killing bad guys, but there isn't an example of that for women."" The film is already in pre-production, with Deadpool's Tim Miller behind the camera and Cameron himself coming up with the story. According to THR, Cameron and Miller have created a writers room to turn the story into a script and hired David Goyer, whose writing credits include the Dark Knight series. Hamilton first starred as Sarah Connor in the 1984 original film, reprising her role seven years later for Judgement Day. The actress was married to Cameron in the late 1990s, but the couple split a few years later, leaving plans for her appearance in further films on hold. When the first Terminator came out, it was praised for its feminist stand regarding Hamilton's character, but Cameron has lately come under fire for his remarks regarding Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman. ""All of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood's been doing over Wonder Woman has been so misguided,"" he told The Guardian. ""She's an objectified icon, and it's just male Hollywood doing the same old thing,"" he added. Jenkins replied on Twitter, saying Cameron's ""inability to understand Wonder Woman"" comes from the fact that ""he is not a woman"". Cameron defended his Sarah Connor character, saying she was ""not a beauty icon"", but ""strong, troubled and a terrible mother"". ""She earned the respect of the audience through pure grit,"" Cameron added. A release date for Terminator 6 is yet to be revealed."

He was detained under section 41 of the Terrorism Act. It means six people are now being held in connection with Friday's attack, which saw a crude home-made bomb left on a London Underground train. No-one was killed when the device failed to properly detonate, but 30 passengers were injured. Thursday's arrest follows those of three men in Newport on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Their ages are 25, 30 and 48. The latter two were said to have been arrested in a ""halfway house"" for asylum seekers, according to neighbours. Police are searching properties in the Gwent town, two addresses in Surrey, and have started searching the Thornton Heath property. An 18-year-old, arrested in Dover on Saturday, and suspected of planting the device, is also still in custody after police got a warrant to hold him until 23 September. The sixth man, Yahyah Farroukh, 21, was arrested at a fried chicken shop in Hounslow, west London, on the same day. A warrant for his detention is expected to expire today (21 September). Both Farroukh and the 18-year-old are believed to have spent time in the care of Penelope and Ronald Jones, from Sunbury-on-Thames, who received MBEs for services to children and families in 2010. The Joneses have been highly respected foster parents for almost 40 years and looked after up to 300 children, including eight refugees. Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We now have six males in custody and searches are continuing at five addresses. ""Detectives are carrying out extensive inquiries to determine the full facts behind the attack. ""We anticipate that the searches will take some days to complete and may cause further disruption."""
2017-09-20,"Students paying £9,250 fees risk being failed by degree courses with huge dropout rates, the universities minister has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170921061835/http://news.sky.com/story/education-minister-jo-johnson-warns-universities-over-67-dropout-rates-11045610,"Jo Johnson said the institutions urgently need to review the ""value for money"" of some courses after research by Sky News found withdrawal rates of up to two thirds. Dropout rates per course are not published by universities, but according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act::: At Wrexham University, a BSc course in Entrepreneurship had a 50% withdrawal rate while 67% dropped out of a degree in Marketing and Consumer Psychology at the same university :: 67% dropped out a Human Resources Management course at Middlesex University and 28.5% left a BA in Business Management:: At the University of East London, the dropout rate for a BSc course in Computer Games Development was 58%:: At Sunderland University, 33% dropped out of a degree in Information Communication Technology:: At London Metropolitan University, 59% left a BA course in Film, Media and Music Mr Johnson said: ""I urge these universities to take action and look urgently at these courses to ensure that students and the taxpayer are receiving value for money for their investment in higher education. ""Dropout rates are lower now than they were in 2009, but we know there is more work to do."" Requests were made to two dozen universities about how many first-year students withdrew from, rather than failed, their course. Students who drop out are liable for fees for part of the year, depending on the point they leave. The universities pointed out that some of the highest dropout rates involved very small numbers of students and that there may be a variety of reasons for the decision. But Lord Adonis, the former Labour education minister and ""architect"" of the fee rise to £3,000-a-year in 2004, said: ""For each individual student who leaves their course early, this is a personal tragedy since they've invested a huge amount of time, emotional energy and ambition into their courses. ""But it's very telling that the universities where individual courses have drop rates of 40, 50, 60% are the same universities are the same universities that have overall drop rates of more than 10 percent. So it's clear that there's something systematically going wrong."" Tory MPs are urging action over fees, and the 6.1% interest rates students pay on them, in this autumn's Budget, to try and win back younger voters. In the aftermath of the election, an insider revealed there had been discussion in Downing Street about abolishing fees altogether. But the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is now understood to be standing firm against cutting the interest rates students pay, and to be considering how to pressure universities whose graduates are less likely to get high-skilled jobs. Reports that he was planning to cut the rate of fees from £9,250 to £7,500 a year were described by Treasury sources as ""speculation"". But ministers are alert to concerns about students' living costs at university, which can contribute to drop-out rates, and the salary threshold at which loans are paid back which has been frozen at £21,000-a-year since 2012. Universities will soon have to publish data on their applications, drop-out rate and attainment, and prove they are boosting access for disadvantaged students, under new laws aimed at holding institutions to account. Mr Johnson has already announced that vice-chancellors paid more than the Prime Minister will have to improve their performance. Tory MP Robert Halfon, former education minister and now chair of Commons Education Committee said the Chancellor must act in his Budget. ""There are too many universities where students go there, they pay their £9,000 tuition fees and are coming out with a huge loan yet not getting the high-skilled, quality jobs that they should be. ""I think we need to take urgent action. I think the level of interest rates for students is far too high,"" he said. ""We need to either look at lowering the interest rate or look at introducing a new system like a graduate tax, or possibly raising the level at which students have to pay back their student loan, maybe we should push that up to £25,000."" The University of Wrexham said both courses had been withdrawn for 2017/18 and that the programmes had low numbers of students ""hence one or two students leaving early have skewed the figures significantly."" A Middlesex University spokesman said: ""We take every student withdrawal very seriously and we have teams in place to support individuals with their decision. ""Many of our students come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are often the first in their family to go to university so we understand that while this is a complex issue and there is no one reason for dropping out, we need to provide additional targeted support."" The University of Sunderland said: ""There are many reasons why students may decide to drop out in their first year. We have a number of measures in place, including infrastructure and staff training, to support students through what can be a huge shift."""
2017-09-20,"Some people, who should probably know better, are describing Ryanair's current difficulties as a ""Ratner moment"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170921061835/http://news.sky.com/story/why-ryanairs-own-goal-is-no-ratner-moment-for-the-brand-11043192,"That, to say the least, is over-egging things. Is this hugely embarrassing to Ryanair? Yes. Is this going to hit its sales and profits this year? Yes. Is this going to damage the confidence of some customers to the extent that they will never again fly with the airline? Yes. But does this situation pose an existential threat to Ryanair? Absolutely not. Gerald Ratner, who ran a jewellery chain bearing his name, made some ill-judged remarks at an after-dinner speech to the Institute of Directors in April 1991 that knocked £500m from his company's stock market value. It almost collapsed in the aftermath and, within 18 months, Mr Ratner had left the business, which shortly afterwards changed its name to Signet Group. :: Ryanair passengers livid over cancellations The only thing that Ryanair's current turmoil has in common with the ""Ratner moment"" - an expression which has become shorthand for a catastrophic error of judgement that threatens the existence of a business - is that roughly the same amount of money, £500m, has been knocked off the airline's stock market value. However, this sum represented nearly 90% of Ratner's stock market value at the time, while Ryanair is a €20bn (£17.7bn) business. However much some financial commentators - most of whom seldom travel economy class, let alone fly with a budget airline - may fulminate, Ryanair's brand is robust and will survive this turbulence. Consumer attitudes have moved on since 1991. When Mr Ratner made his gaffe, describing some of his products as ""total cr**"", it was genuinely shocking. By contrast, Ryanair's mercurial chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has never pretended that the airline offered the last word in passenger comforts. For him, it has always been about the price. Offer the lowest seats in the business and people will travel with you, even when they have foresworn never to do so. Customers have accepted it. As long ago as 2002, Mr O'Leary was telling The Independent newspaper: ""Do we sometimes p*** people off? Of course we do. ""But 60% of the complaints we get are people looking for refunds of what everyone knows is a non-refundable ticket. And the answer to that will always be 'No, you're not getting a refund, we told you it was non-refundable, go away'."" He went further than this a year later when he told the Financial Times: ""We don't fall over ourselves if, say, they say 'My granny fell ill'. What part of no refund don't you understand? You are not getting a refund so f*** off."" Those claiming this latest crisis will bring down Ryanair should read the history books. The low-cost airline has gone through worse problems than this in the past. Back in 2001, when foot-and-mouth disease caused the cancellation of the Cheltenham Festival - the equivalent of a religious pilgrimage for tens of thousands of Irish racing fans - Ryanair refused to give refunds unless customers had bought a changeable ticket. Mr O'Leary himself is a racing nut who owns a number of previous winners at Cheltenham and who well understands the importance of the event to customers in the market that first helped Ryanair become the world's most profitable airline. He knew this would make Ryanair unpopular but stuck to his guns. And the airline came through it. There have been numerous other incidents down the years. The only time that Ryanair has softened its attitude towards customer service came in 2013 when easyJet, a rival that Mr O'Leary had routinely disparaged, began offering services such as allocated seating. It quickly won over millions of people who were avoiding Ryanair due to its perceived poor service. So Mr O'Leary, as any good businessman does, adapted to the demands of the market. Ryanair became, in his words, less ""irritating and confrontational"", making changes such as improving its website, offering allocated seating itself and reducing penalties for customers - previously described as ""stupid"" - who forgot to print out their boarding passes. Being ""nice"" to passengers paid off, and Ryanair soon made up ground lost to easyJet. By this summer, it was even complaining that it had become a ""victim of our own niceness"", suggesting customers were abusing the increased on-board baggage allowances it was now offering. These recent flight cancellations imply a return to the bad old days. They are not. They are more a result of the tight margins for error in the way businesses like Ryanair are now run. The so-called ""just in time"" supply chains used by supermarkets are another example. If something goes wrong, problems can swiftly escalate. In Ryanair's instance, it appears that changing the basis on which pilot and crew's flying hours were calculated from an April-to-March basis to a calendar year has led to shortages of pilots, possibly exacerbated by defections of some pilots to the rival airline Norwegian. But the cancellations do need to be put in context. As Mr O'Leary has pointed out, 2,000 flights sounds like a lot, but less than 2% of Ryanair's customers will suffer disruption. ""In the context of an operation in which we operate 2,500 flights every day, it is reasonably small,"" he has said. Analysts at stockbroker JP Morgan Cazenove told their clients this morning to buy the shares following Monday's sell-off.

""It is only right that those who've performed above and beyond in this fight against the evil of our time get the recognition they deserve. This medal will do just that,"" he told troops at a base just north of Baghdad. ""Our troops have made huge contributions to the fight against Daesh, helping end its tyranny in large parts of Iraq and Syria."" Sir Michael met personnel in Erbil and Taji, where they have been involved in training Iraqi security forces, Kurdish soldiers and Ninewah police. The RAF has conducted more than 1,500 strikes against Islamic State targets and the British military has helped train nearly 60,000 Iraqi Security Forces so far. Around 1,400 British personnel have been deployed over the three years so the medal will be awarded retrospectively. It is estimated 3,600 will receive the honour from next year. :: IS cell planning Europe attacks 'has moved' The British military has been deployed on and off in Iraq for the best part of the last 25 years. Sir Michael said that they would stay there at least until Islamic State was defeated but hoped that then ""British troops wouldn't need to come back to Iraq"". He also met the Kurdish President on his visit to Erbil and passed on a message that the British Government does not support the upcoming independence referendum. Kurdistan will hold the vote next Monday and the government is expecting to receive overwhelming support for its push for independence. The US, UK and others have opposed it however, saying the timing is wrong and it will damage the fight against Islamic State."

The trial involved three Muslim men and a teenager who were eventually convicted of rape and jailed. Police said Golding had been charged with three counts of harassment while Fransen was charged with four. Both have been bailed to appear before Medway magistrates on 17 October 2017.

Thousands of motorists were trapped on the motorway for around 12 hours after emergency services were called at 7.30am on Tuesday. Pictures on Twitter showed people playing football and other sports on the clear side of the carriageway as their cars were stationary for so long. The substance was found in a 5 litre container in a black refuse bag on the hard shoulder, underneath a road connecting the villages of Little Linford and Gayhurst, near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. The bomb squad was called and a robot dispatched to examine what appeared to be a sack or bag containing the substance. Inspector Scott Long of Thames Valley Police said: ""We are appealing to anyone who knows why or how this object was left under a bridge about two miles past the Newport Pagnell services on the southbound carriageway of the M1. ""The object has now been removed from the scene in a secure container but is still being analysed - however, we do know the substance is a highly corrosive material, possibly hydrochloric acid."" He said the substance had reacted with something else, causing it to discharge on to lane one and lane two of the southbound carriageway. ""We are keeping an open mind as to how the object was left at the scene but at this stage we are investigating the incident as an offence under Section 23A of the Road Traffic Act, which is placing an item on a highway or carriageway with intent to cause danger to other road users."" Inspector Long said there was no evidence to suggest it was a terror-related incident. ""We apologise for the inconvenience caused to motorists who were stuck in queues yesterday but your safety, and the safety of our officers and the staff of our partner agencies, Is our priority,"" he added. Anyone with information about the incident, including motorists who may have dashcam footage of the object being left at the scene, are asked to contact Thames Valley Police by calling 101 and quoting reference 138 (19/9)."

The Central American country suffers so much because of its position on a large grid of tectonic plates, on which all the Earth's countries and seas sit. Mexico is on the edge of two the world's largest - the North American and Pacific plates - as well as the smaller Cocos plate. It also falls on the 'Ring of Fire', a horseshoe shaped area around the edges of the Pacific Ocean, from Australia to the Andes, along which 90% of all earthquakes occur. Mexico's location makes it particularly vulnerable to earth tremors. The Earth's plates grind against each other all the time. Sometimes they get stuck and pressure builds-an earthquake is the sudden and violent release of this pressure. On top of this, the Cocos plate is denser than the landmass of Mexico itself, meaning the country's soft earth crumbles more easily. This combination makes it one of the most seismically active countries on the planet. Mexico City, where more than 200 people have been killed in the latest tremor, was also mostly built on a former lakebed, making it even more susceptible. Japan, Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nepal, the Philippines, India and El Salvador are also among the countries most vulnerable to earthquakes."

They shuffled stolen funds through these accounts to disguise the source of the money before transferring it back to cybercriminals in Eastern Europe. Nilesh Sheth, 53, who was then a personal banking manager at Barclays, was ""instrumental"" in opening the ""mule accounts"", the NCA said. While under surveillance by the agency, the gang was seen meeting with Sheth at the bank and in public places including restaurants and car parks. The money laundering operation was run by Iurie Mereacre, a 37-year-old Moldovan national, from his home in Woodford Green, northeast London. He was assisted by associates, brothers Iurie Bivol, 36, and Serghei Bivol, 31, and Ryingota Gincota, 28, also of Woodford Green. Mike Hulett, head of Operations at the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: ""Criminals rely heavily on money launderers like Mereacre and his associates in order to access their profits."" When the NCA had enough evidence to make the arrests in November 2016, they found multiple mobile phones both at Sheth's house in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, and Mereacre's house in Woodford Green. The phones had been used to communicate with Mereacre and contained messages organising meetings and payment. More than £16,000 in cash was also recovered at Sheth's house. Mereacre, Sheth and both Bivol brothers pleaded guilty to their roles in the conspiracy at Old Bailey in June. Gincota decided to go to trial, but instead pleaded guilty to fraud offences on Wednesday. Rose-Marie Franton, from the CPS International Justice and Organised Crime Division, said: ""These men deliberately and persistently set about transferring millions of pounds of stolen money out of the UK to Eastern Europe. ""The evidence we gathered showed how Nilesh Sheth abused his position as a bank employee for personal gain by facilitating the laundering the criminal proceeds of an organised crime group both within the UK and across borders."" A Barclays spokesperson said: ""This is a rare occasion where an individual deliberately exploited our systems. We have worked with and supported the NCA with this investigation and welcome the outcome of proceedings. ""Barclays will always support law enforcement in identifying criminal activity and bringing prosecutions."""

Mr Simmonds was speaking following the news that the two suspects in custody over the Parsons Green terror attack had both arrived in the UK and had been fostered as part of their resettlement from Iraq and Syria. While not commenting directly on the case, he outlined a worry that he says is shared by many local authorities across the UK. ""Councils have long been raising concerns that the information we get is inadequate,"" he said. ""It was a big concern that was raised at the time when the Calais camp was closed last year and a significant cohort of children all arrived at the same time and that hasn't gone away. ""But clearly we are trying to ensure that we work with ministers to make sure the checks that are done at the border pick up those risks as best they can."" Mr Simmonds, who has responsibility for children's services in the London borough of Hillingdon next to Heathrow airport, added: ""I understand that the Home Office is in a difficult position. ""It won't always be able to do the kind of in-depth vetting, but in many situations we know from foster carers and others involved with those children is that the warning signs are there. ""Where we have those concerns at the point when they arrive we can be much more certain at protecting them or protecting other people that if it is kept confidential."" The details of when and how the Parsons Green suspects entered the UK have not been disclosed. Both are still in custody and have not yet been charged with any offence. The Home Office told Sky News individuals who seek asylum in the UK are subject to checks. It added that if the results of those checks are of concern, they are shared with the local authority."

Amid a flurry of complaints about customers being left stranded - with many forking out for accommodation and struggling to contact the airline - it announced on Wednesday that it was making progress in tackling the backlog. Ryanair said it expected to have re-booked 55% of the total affected by close of business on Wednesday, with 20% of customers receiving their refunds by then. :: Ryanair row will not bring down the airline The airline said it had hired extra staff to help process the refund and re-booking requests - adding that it was on track to have resolved 95% of the work by the end of the week. The company's colourful chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Monday that he took personal responsibility for the ""mess"" which he mainly attributed to the planning of pilot holidays. A backlog of crew leave, air traffic control strikes and weather disruptions were other factors. He denied reports that the defection of 140 pilots to a Norwegian rival was a factor. The airline's marketing chief, Kenny Jacobs, said of its work to resolve passengers' plans: ""The vast majority of these requests are being dealt with online, but as our call centres and chat lines are extremely busy, we ask affected customers to bear with us as we do everything we can to respond to their requests and try to resolve any problems we have created for them, for which we again sincerely apologise."" :: Full list of Ryanair's cancelled flights Living proof that cheap is expensive !  £25 to call their ""helpline"".

The feathered animals, which include puffins, razorbills and gulls, have been rushed to vets to be cleaned with washing-up liquid. Using the product not only cleans them but also makes the birds waterproof, ensuring they will keep warm enough to stay alive when released, Ms Miller said. Some of the birds have been less lucky than others. ""The first ones to come into us were of a good weight and alert but some of the ones coming in over the past day have been less so and very sadly a couple of them have not made it,"" Ms Miller said.

""What's really amazing to see is the range of people who were inspired by his work,"" curator Eleanor Nairne admits. ""On one hand you have a film-maker like John Akomfra, who says that was it not for Basquiat he wouldn't be an artist today, (and on the other) a huge figure like Jay Z who not only cite him as a really influential figure but also own some of these pieces."" At the start of the 80s, in a matter of years, Jean-Michel Basquiat went from being a homeless graffiti artist to a star of New York's art scene. ""I never went to art school,"" he said. ""I just looked at a lot of things, and that's why I think I learned about art by looking at it."" He emerged at a moment in New York when, for the first time, graffiti was being seen as art rather than a defacement, but Basquiat wasn't one to be pigeon-holed. Ms Nairne says: ""He was conscious in his own lifetime that this label of a street artist could be limiting to him. ""Although he is involved in graffiti that's quite a brief chapter in his career."" So what would Basquiat make of street artist Banksy's latest works which, at the start of the week, popped up on the side of the Barbican? On social media the infamous art figure seems to mock the location of the Basquiat retrospective, writing how it's ""a place that is normally very keen to clean any graffiti from its walls"". Diego Cortez, a curator and friend, believes ""he'd like it"". ""Of course, he's not alive and I'm just speculating, but I think he'd be honoured by it."" Almost as quickly as Basquiat's career begun it was over. At 27 he died of a heroin overdose. Those who knew him say he'd found the rockstar-like attention he received overwhelming. He'd collaborated with Andy Warhol, dated Madonna - the New York art scene of the 80s was wild. Suzanne Mallouk knew him from when he was homeless through to his death. ""One day he came home with five Armani suits - he must have spent $40,000 - and he looked sad. He sat on the couch and said, 'Suzanne I don't know what else do buy - do you want something?' ""I think he was very attracted to the money but at the same time he saw a danger in the fame."" Now a psychologist, Ms Mallouk insists he had a rare gift. ""He is able to capture his own mind in a way that is profound and prolific. It's rare that someone, through creativity, can show someone their own mind like that.""

Mrs May's top EU adviser Oliver Robbins told his counterparts in EU capitals, including Berlin, that the offer would be included in the Prime Minister's address, the report says. Downing Street has dismissed it as ""pure speculation about a speech that has not yet been given"". The so-called Brexit bill has emerged as a main stumbling block in divorce talks with Brussels, and Mrs May might look to break the deadlock with a financial offer. No figure so far has been floated by the British Government or the EU. If confirmed, the €20bn figure might be significantly lower than what Brussels reportedly wants - around €60bn (£53bn) The Government has said the time of big sums of cash going to the EU ends with Brexit, but has acknowledged in principle that it will make a payment. Downing Street has been tight-lipped about Mrs May's speech, seen as the most important intervention on Brexit since her Lancaster House address in January. It comes amid reports of a split in the Cabinet over the Brexit strategy, after Boris Johnson wrote an explosive 4,000-word newspaper article setting out his own vision for the divorce. Mr Johnson's blueprint calls for a clean-break Brexit that envisages no payments to gain access to the European single market. The intervention prompted calls for Mrs May to sack the Foreign Secretary over the breakdown in Cabinet discipline, as well as reports Mr Johnson might be ready to resign if his vision is not heeded in Mrs May's speech. Both sides have sought to play down the row. Mr Johnson has dismissed speculation he might resign this weekend, telling the Guardian newspaper that he was ""mystified"" by the suggestion. ""It feels to me like an attempt to keep the great snore-athon story about my article running. I think that is what is going on,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I am confident she will set out an exciting and positive vision for Brexit and it will be a speech around which everyone can unite.""

The ministry's Mikhail Ulyanov said the country was working ""behind the scenes"" to find a political solution, but admitted the use of sanctions against North Korea is almost exhausted. China echoed Russia's concerns, and said war on the peninsula would have ""no winners"". On Monday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said the isolated state had the right to ""shoot down"" US planes - even if they were not in the country's airspace. It followed President Trump's claim that Mr Kim may not be around much longer - a statement the foreign minister said amounted to a declaration of war. The Pentagon responded with its own threat, saying that if North Korea did not stop its provocative actions, it would make sure the ""President is provided with options to deal with Pyongyang"". However, the White House said it was ""absurd"" to suggest the US had declared war. ""We have not declared war against North Korea and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. Speaking in India, US defence secretary James Mattis stressed that the US wants to resolve the escalating nuclear crisis with North Korea diplomatically. Praising India's efforts to step up pressure on North Korea over its ""dangerous and destabilising behaviour"", Mr Mattis added: ""We maintain the capability to deter North Korea's most dangerous threats but also to back up our diplomats in a manner that keeps this as long as possible in the diplomatic realm."" Last week, in his first speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Trump vowed to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it continued to threaten the US and it allies. The Pentagon called Saturday's flight by bombers and fighter jets a ""show of force"" designed to demonstrate the range of military options available to President Trump."

However, the management has now put a stop to the 18-year-old's aquatic exploits, citing health and safety reasons. ""It's mainly the health and safety risk, because the legs are bound together and they worried that I might get into trouble in the water or that I might end up hitting somebody,"" she said. While Miss Trigger's tail, made of spandex-type material, cost £150, they can be purchased for up to £4,000. The teenager said she had received positive feedback from others about the costume and is hoping she can find another pool that will allow her to wear it. She said she was first inspired to try a tail after watching a YouTube video about mermaid outfits. ""But I'm out of action now,"" she said. ""It's more of a case of trying to find somewhere else to swim or seeing if there's another path I can take with this. ""It's quite a big drawback at the moment."""

The Duke and Duchess live in Kensington Palace, a royal residence in one of the most affluent parts of the borough. Ms Dent Coad also complained it was ""disgusting"" the Duchess of Cambridge had bought jumpers at an estimated cost of £150 each when ""that's a food bill for a family of four"", adding: ""That's absolutely outrageous."" She also attacked the BBC for producing ""sickeningly gratuitous coverage of anything royal"" and accused the broadcaster of being ""very heavily directed by right-wing politics and the monarchy"". ""It is a piece of the whole propaganda machine,"" she said. Ms Dent Coad won the Kensington seat in June's general election, her slim majority of 20 giving Labour its first win in the constituency. She was thrust into the limelight almost immediately after the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed around 80 people. London Mayor Sadiq Khan called her an ""amazing advocate for the neglected residents"" who were left devastated by the disaster."
2017-09-26,It's quite the leap from cordless vacuums to electric cars - but Dyson is in a good position to attempt the jump.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170926220345/http://news.sky.com/story/dysons-electric-car-plan-all-about-one-thing-batteries-11054598,"The vacuum cleaner manufacturer's announcement of an electric vehicle is about one thing: batteries. Dyson has been working on battery technology for a while now, to make its vacuum cleaners last longer on a charge. Most of its products are now cordless. Last March, the company announced it was investing £1bn in battery research and development. Batteries are, of course, what electric cars run on. But more than that, they're the competitive edge for the entire industry. Every auto manufacturer, from Tesla to Jaguar Land Rover, is working on the next breakthrough. That's because, with the internal combustion engine and drivetrain removed, electric cars are radically simpler to make than traditional vehicles. James Dyson just announced to @Dyson employees that we’ve begun work on a battery electric vehicle, due to launch in 2020. pic.twitter.com/yUZNvIsYIi Analysts at JP Morgan say that the average electric vehicle has only 20 moving parts, compared to 2,000 in an internal combustion vehicle. So battery know-how becomes relatively more important than the traditional expertise of a car maker. That opens the car market to a whole host of new competitors - now including Dyson. Still, a whole new market is a big ask for any company. Making an electric car at scale and cheaply has flummoxed incumbents like Volvo and JLR, as well as disruptors like Tesla, for a while. But Dyson did a similar thing back in 2006, with the introduction of the Air Blade, the fanciest hand dryer ever developed. It looked like a bit of a punt but now it and its knock-off versions are everywhere. The same goes for its desktop fans and hairdryers. They're also built around a bit of kit that's quite useful for cars: electric motors. Dyson has been transporting its core technologies into different products and markets for some time. Electric cars are just the latest, most ambitious manifestation of that."

The figure marks a 17% increase in the use of low carbon sources in four years, while over the same period average carbon dioxide emissions for each unit of power fell by more than half (56%). This summer, almost a quarter of power generation (24%) came from renewable sources, up from just 9% four years ago. To further reduce the amount of carbon emissions, the National Grid is working with the Environmental Defense Fund Europe and WWF to make software that can forecast the ""carbon intensity"" of electricity generation up to two days ahead. WWF is using the data to develop an online tool that can inform homeowners of the best times to turn on or off home appliances to minimise carbon emissions. Changing times of usage can reduce household bills and the need to use back-up fossil fuel power plants to meet demand, National Grid said. The network's director of operations, Duncan Burt, said: ""Clear and concise information that can tell you in advance when's best to turn on the washing machine, load the dishwasher or charge your car for example, is a step in the right direction towards a low carbon future. ""This technology puts people at the heart of it, helping everyone to use power when it's greenest, and likely, more cost efficient."" Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate and energy at WWF, described the developments as a ""game changer"". He said: ""It's time for the UK Government to step up and deliver a strong and ambitious clean growth plan, continuing to support renewables, cleaning up our transport and making our homes more energy efficient."""

The ordeal, after the pair met on a dating website, lasted for six hours and was caught on a camera at the victim's home. Mr Fasoli, a computer repairman, could be heard begging for his life on the film. But Marshall threatened to cut his tongue out unless he gave him his bank cards and PIN numbers, the Old Bailey heard. To cover his tracks, Marshall set fire to Mr Fasoli's bungalow in Northolt, west London, leaving him for dead, in January 2013. The 29-year-old attacker then stole nearly £800 from his victim and fled to Rome in Italy - where he killed again. He also attacked a third man in his own home in Italy before being caught. For nearly two years, Mr Fasoli's death was put down to an accident. However, his nephew stumbled across harrowing webcam footage of the killing on his uncle's computer hard drive. During his trial, Marshall told the jury he could not remember the attack, which was replayed in the court. In the disturbing footage, Myleene Klass's Classic FM show can be heard in the background. On Tuesday, Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC sentenced Marshall to life with a minimum of 39 years for murder. He said: ""I am sure you were motivated by a desire to cause Mr Fasoli pain without his consent, which would be a significantly greater source of pleasure or gratification to you. ""You tortured him for so long because you enjoyed it so much. ""I'm sure that you can have felt no remorse whatsoever for what you have done. ""On the contrary, you derived pleasure from it."" Judge Hilliard asked for more information about why the initial police investigation did not examine Mr Fasoli's bank records or social media activity. These eventually revealed Mr Fasoli's bank card had been used after his death, as well as details about the pair's date. He said: ""I express the hope that someone who is in a position to do so, so far as the Metropolitan Police is concerned, will look at whether procedures for investigations are significantly comprehensive and robust in such circumstances."" Prosecutor Ed Brown QC told the court a detective superintendent looked ""very carefully"" at what happened and found there was ""no breach of any procedure"". Marshall, from East Ham, east London, is already serving 16 years for the attacks in Italy. He showed no reaction as he was sent down. In mitigation, his lawyer Tomas Quinn said he had a ""bizarre"" history of impersonating police officers, ticket inspectors and special constables. Detective Inspector James Stevenson, of Scotland Yard, said: ""He is clearly a very sadistic individual. ""He has a psychopathic personality disorder but does not have a treatable mental illness."""
2017-09-26,"The dangers of pregnant women using epilepsy drug valproate have been kept from patients for decades, according to documents uncovered from The National Archives. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170926220345/http://news.sky.com/story/valproate-risk-hidden-from-pregnant-women-for-decades-11053919,"Two years ago, a new Europe-wide alert warned that the drug caused disabilities in 40% of the babies of mothers who used valproate. But campaigners have discovered documents, seen by Sky News, suggesting that in July 1973 regulators decided not to warn patients directly for fear it ""could give rise to fruitless anxiety"". :: Valproate behind thousands of birth defects - study At the time health professionals were told: ""This compound has been shown to be teratogenic in animals, meaning it could harm the human foetus."" But the Committee on Safety of Medicines, a precursor to the MHRA (Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), instructed the same alert should ""not (go) on the package inserts, so that there would be no danger of patients themselves seeing it"". Estimates of the number of babies born with disabilities by women who used the drug range from 7,000-20,000. Recent research by epilepsy charities found that one in every six users remain unaware of the risks. Campaigners are passing their findings to the European Medicines Agency and are calling on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to make an urgent public warning and ensure all women and girls taking the drug have annual consultations about the risks associated with pregnancy. Valproate syndrome sufferer, Branwen Mann, 21, will tell the hearing of the horrendous side effects she suffers after her mother, Deborah, who took valproate from the age of 14, was prescribed a higher than normal dose during pregnancy. Ms Mann told Sky News: ""I've developed issues with my brain, I've got these blanking spells that I know is not epilepsy, I suffer from migraines, I've been told I could die any time soon."" Janet Williams, chief executive of In-Fact, a support group for victims of the drug, found the documents in The National Archives. She told Sky News: ""We want to make sure that all women get the informed choice and it is made mandatory that doctors must warn women pre-pregnancy. ""The documents show that the MHRA's predecessors have know about this since 1973 - and chose not to inform the patients who were prescribed it. ""I'm appalled - it's astonishing how they can carry on knowing children are being harmed by this drug and refuse to do anything about it."" Mrs Williams was encouraged to seek out the documents after meeting with alleged victims of the drug Primodos, who also believe they were let down by the same regulator. The licence issued in 1974 for Epilim, a trade name for sodium valproate, insisted that doctors and pharmacists should use it only in severe cases of epilepsy or where there was no alternative. About 28,000 women aged 14-45 receive a prescription for valproate in the UK in a six-month period, with about 450 children born to these women a year. A MHRA spokesperson said: ""At that time, it would have been for the doctor to decide how much information a patient was given about their medicine. ""This attitude to provision of information to patients would not have been unusual at that time, particularly in relation to lifesaving medicines such as anticonvulsants, as there was a concern that information about side effects may have caused people to stop treatment."""

The condition of her remains, found on Saturday, suggest she was not attacked by stray dogs as initially thought, coroner Nikolaos Kifinidis said. ""It seems like she may have been attacked by other wild animals, like rabid wolves and jackals,"" he told The Times. Ms Hollingworth reportedly tried to contact family members in London after being attacked but lost signal on her phone. The 62-year-old was a former Oxford professor who worked as an administrator for the University of Bristol. She spent time campaigning for the Bath Against Cuts group, which described her as ""always optimistic"".

Woodward, of Christ Church, St Aldate's, Oxford, had pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding her partner at an earlier hearing. Woodward stabbed her then boyfriend in the leg after punching him in the face and then threw a laptop, glass and jam jar at him during the attack on 30 September 2016, the court previously heard. The court had also heard the student has already had articles published in medical journals and a prison term could have resulted in her being barred from working as a doctor. Last May, Judge Ian Pringle QC told Woodward she was unlikely to go to prison after he imposed a restraining order on her and delayed sentencing. He told her at the time: ""If this was a one-off, to prevent this extraordinarily able young lady from following her desire to enter the medical profession would be too severe."" On Monday Judge Pringle handed Woodward, who faced a maximum of three years in prison, a 10-month jail sentence, suspended for 18 months, and told her: ""There are many mitigating features in your case. ""Principally, at the age of 24 you have no previous convictions of any nature whatsoever. ""Secondly, I find that you were genuinely remorseful following this event and, indeed, it was against your bail conditions, you contacted your partner to fully confess your guilt and your deep sorrow for what happened. ""Thirdly, whilst you are a clearly highly intelligent individual, you had an immaturity about you which was not commensurate for someone of your age."" The judge continued: ""Fourthly, as the reports from the experts make clear, you suffer from an emotionally unstable personality disorder, a severe eating disorder and alcohol drug dependence. ""Finally, and most significantly, you have demonstrated over the last nine months that you are determined to rid yourself of your alcohol and drug addiction and have undergone extensive treatment including counselling to address the many issues that you face. ""In particular, you have demonstrated to me since I adjourned this matter in May a strong and unwavering determination to do so despite the enormous pressure under which you were put and which has been referred to me by your counsel."" College dean the Very Rev Professor Martyn Percy said afterwards: ""We are concerned for the welfare of all our students and it is clearly a matter of regret and sadness when any young person blights a promising career by committing a crime. ""Ms Woodward is not currently studying at Oxford, having voluntarily suspended her medical studies. ""The question of her future will now be decided by the university, which has procedures in place when a student is the subject of a criminal conviction."""

Booth was the father of Cherie Blair - and when his son-in-law Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, the actor's political views proved to be an occasional thorn in his side. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2004 and had also suffered heart problems. In Till Death Us Do Part in the 1960s, Booth became known to viewers as ""Scouse git"" Mike - the long-haired, left-wing son-in-law of right-wing cockney Alf Garnett. Booth was the father of nine daughters, and he was married four times. His third marriage was to Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner in Coronation Street. She died from cancer a week after their wedding in 1986. He married his fourth wife Stephanie Buckley in 1998. Cherie Booth was born in Lancashire in 1954 during his marriage to Gale Booth, but her father left his young family when she was five. A political campaigner, Booth joined the Labour Party when he was 15, and in later years he did not hold back from criticising the government when Mr Blair was given the keys to Downing Street. In 2000, he claimed Mr Blair had stuffed the House of Lords with ""Tony's Cronies"". Two years later, he controversially lifted the lid on life in Downing Street with his autobiography, What's Left? Despite the political differences, Booth remained close to his daughter, and was with her and her husband at his constituency election count at the 2005 general election. Born in Liverpool in 1931, Booth discovered a talent for acting during his national service. As well as his role in Till Death Us Do Part, he spent a brief time on the cobbles in Coronation Street between 1960 and 1961, playing Malcolm Wilkinson. His acting career enjoyed a revival in the 1990s, with roles in Holby City, The Bill and Mersey Beat. In 1979, Booth almost burned himself to death in a fire at his flat, and he remained in hospital for months."

Holidaymakers have been flocking to the Spanish mainland, as well as the Canaries and the Balearics (Ibiza, Menorca and Majorca) - following political instability and concerns over safety in other tourist destinations. Last month, the tour operator said it had resumed selling holidays to Tunisia for the first time since the terrorist beach attack in the resort of Sousse in 2015, when a gunman killed 38 people, including 30 Britons. The tour operator said while it had seen a pick-up in demand to other destinations such as Turkey and Egypt, Spain remained its customers' number one choice and accounted for around 40% of the holidays the group sold this summer. The pound has fallen from €1.30 just before the EU referendum to around €1.13 on Tuesday - a drop of 13%. Thomas Cook's warning on prices came as chief executive Peter Fankhauser said the firm had dealt with an ""operationally challenging"" past month as it dealt with the impact of Hurricane Irma on up to 22,000 of its customers in the Caribbean and Florida. In its latest trading update, the company reported total bookings this summer were 11% higher across the group, with UK bookings up by 8%. Bookings to Greece, which is dealing with a migrant crisis, were up 20% compared with last year, while holidays sold in Cyprus saw a 16% bounce. The firm also unveiled a tie-up with Swiss-based hotel property development firm LMEY Investments to grow its own-brand hotel portfolio, acquiring a 42% stake in Aldiana, a German tour operator and hotel management firm. It follows an alliance with Expedia earlier this month, to make the US travel giant its preferred provider of hotels for city and domestic holidays."

The survey of 1,000 workers found that two out of five workers believed they were paid less than their colleagues, while only a fraction (6%) thought they were paid more. More than half (53%) admitted they have no idea of their true value to employers, and said they would never discuss salaries with a co-worker. :: Women managers earn 12k less than men As a result, just 13.6% said they had successfully lobbied their boss for a pay rise. Workers in their 20s were more confident in their levels of pay, while those aged 35-44 were most insecure. ""British workplaces are rife with uncertainty over pay,"" said Adzuna co-founder Doug Monro. ""An ingrained lack of transparency over earnings and salary bandings has created a culture of conviction others must be paid more than us.

The letter, which Mr Morgan posted on Facebook, added: ""I must apply the same standards to Labour as I would to any other party conference or political event; whilst none of us can control what is said at meetings we do not run, I have to make the strongest possible representation on behalf of the residents of the city who are Jewish.

The actress went on to star in more than 6,700 episodes as Vera Duckworth and husband Jack, played by Bill Tarmey, became two of Coronation Street's best-loved characters. Dawn was diagnosed with emphysema in 2004 and left the soap four years later in an episode which attracted more than 12.5m viewers. She returned to make a cameo appearance in 2010, as Jack Duckworth saw a vision of his wife before passing away.

Former Coronation Street actress Tracy Brabin described the 77-year-old as ""warm hearted, generous and hilarious"". Ms Brabin, now MP for Batley and Spen, told Sky News: ""I always thought she was incredibly humble and that she knew the importance of it.

That's good news."" The reference was a clear dig at Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who has claimed Britain could have its cake and eat it when it comes to leaving the EU. On the progress of the negotiations, Mr Tusk said Brexit was an exercise in ""damage control"", adding: ""I feel now we will discuss our future relations with the UK once there is so-called sufficient progress.

In a statement after the meeting, Mrs May said her Florence speech had been intended to create ""momentum"", but it was now important for EU negotiators to ""respond in the same spirit"". In the speech she set out plans for a two-year transition period before Brexit takes full effect and promised the UK would ""honour its commitments"" on the EU budget. Mr Tusk told the PM: ""After your excellent speech in Florence I am much more optimistic. Of course, still we have to do something maybe more substantive."" Mrs May said the pair agreed that ""things have moved on"" in the Brexit process. She stressed the need for a ""good economic and security partnership"" between the UK and EU once the divorce is finalised. The PM said: ""I set out in my speech last week in Florence the hope for working together to that deep and special partnership I think we want to create with the European Union once we leave the European Union. ""And the commitment we have to looking for a really good economic partnership. ""I think that by being creative in the ways that we approach these issues we can find solutions that work both for the remaining 27 but also for the UK and maintain that co-operation and partnership between the UK and the EU."" Mr Tusk discussed progress in the exit negotiations with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier before heading to London. The fourth round of talks began in Brussels on Monday, with Brexit Secretary David Davis insisting there are ""no excuses"" for blocking progress. Mr Davis said the PM's speech set out ""concrete proposals"" and a breakthrough was now needed. But Mr Barnier insisted real progress on citizens' rights, the Irish border and the so-called ""exit bill"" was ""essential"" to move discussions to the next phase. He said he was ""keen and eager"" to see how Mrs May's speech would be turned into a negotiating strategy."

""Officers forced entry and found an 80-year-old woman unresponsive. ""Although we await formal identification we are confident that the deceased is Lady Lucan."" Her death is being treated as unexplained, but is not believed to be suspicious. George Bingham, her son and the 8th Earl Lucan, told the Daily Mail: ""She passed away yesterday at home, alone and apparently peacefully. ""Police were alerted by a companion to a three-day absence and made entry today."" Lady Lucan was one of the last people to see her husband John Bingham, the 7th Earl of Lucan, alive before he mysteriously disappeared. He vanished after the body of Sandra Rivett, nanny to his three children, was found at the family's London home on 7 November, 1974. Lady Lucan was also severely beaten but managed to escape and raise the alarm at a nearby pub. Lord Lucan's car was later found abandoned and soaked in blood in the port town of Newhaven, East Sussex, and an inquest jury later ruled that he was the killer. Earlier this year, Lady Lucan - formally known as Veronica, Dowager Countess of Lucan - said she believed her husband had made the ""brave"" decision to take his own life. She told an ITV documentary: ""I would say he got on the ferry and jumped off in the middle of the Channel in the way of the propellers so that his remains wouldn't be found - I think quite brave.""

Mrs May has lobbied US President Donald Trump over the dispute, and raised it in talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on a visit there last week. Bombardier labelled the decision ""absurd"" and said Boeing was guilty of hypocrisy. But the US aerospace giant said the row ""had nothing to do with limiting innovation or competition"" but was about ""maintaining a level playing field and ensuring that aerospace companies abide by trade agreements"". Unions accused Mrs May of being ""asleep at the wheel"" on the dispute, saying the preliminary finding was ""unlikely"" to be overturned by Mr Trump. Ross Murdoch, the GMB union's national officer, said it was a ""hammer blow"" to Belfast and could have wider ramifications. On top of the 4,000 people directly employed at Bombardier's plant, Mr Murdoch warned another 9,400 supply chain jobs could be wiped out.

2017-09-27,Labour has been threatened with a ban on holding future conferences in Brighton unless it tackles anti-Semitism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-could-face-brighton-conference-ban-over-anti-semitism-claims-11054721,"Brighton and Hove's Labour council leader Warren Morgan said he was very concerned at ""the anti-Semitism being aired publicly in fringe meetings and on the floor of conference"". In a letter to Labour Party general secretary Iain McNicol, Mr Morgan said: ""As the Labour leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, I will undoubtedly face questions as to why we allow any event where anti-Semitic views are freely expressed to happen in the city, particularly on council premises. :: Corbyn should be embarrassed by anti-Semitism row ""As a Labour Party member, I expect the inquiry announced today to take firm action; as leader I will need reassurances that there will be no repeat of the behaviour and actions we have seen this week before any further bookings from the party are taken."" The letter, which Mr Morgan posted on Facebook, added: ""I must apply the same standards to Labour as I would to any other party conference or political event; whilst none of us can control what is said at meetings we do not run, I have to make the strongest possible representation on behalf of the residents of the city who are Jewish. ""We are a city of sanctuary and I have to speak up against any form of racism as and when it is given a platform in the city."" An anti-Semitism row threatened to overshadow the third day of Labour's conference after a fringe event speaker reportedly said people should be allowed to question whether the Holocaust happened. Activists were also claimed to have cheered calls for Jewish and pro-Israel groups to be expelled from the party. The chair of the Jewish Labour Movement said Jeremy Corbyn should be ""acutely embarrassed"" by the row, while the party was told to ""do more to establish that it is not a racist party"" by Britain's equality watchdog. Party members backed a move to toughen Labour's regulations on ""incidents involving racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or otherwise racist language, sentiments, stereotypes or actions"" in a conference vote on Tuesday."
2017-09-27,"Actor and political campaigner Tony Booth, who starred in the sitcom Till Death Us Do Part, has died.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/cherie-blairs-father-actor-tony-booth-dies-aged-85-11054124,"In a statement, the 85-year-old's family said he passed away with ""close family members in attendance"". Booth was the father of Cherie Blair - and when his son-in-law Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, the actor's political views proved to be an occasional thorn in his side. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2004 and had also suffered heart problems. In Till Death Us Do Part in the 1960s, Booth became known to viewers as ""Scouse git"" Mike - the long-haired, left-wing son-in-law of right-wing cockney Alf Garnett. Booth was the father of nine daughters, and he was married four times. His third marriage was to Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner in Coronation Street. She died from cancer a week after their wedding in 1986. He married his fourth wife Stephanie Buckley in 1998. Cherie Booth was born in Lancashire in 1954 during his marriage to Gale Booth, but her father left his young family when she was five. A political campaigner, Booth joined the Labour Party when he was 15, and in later years he did not hold back from criticising the government when Mr Blair was given the keys to Downing Street. In 2000, he claimed Mr Blair had stuffed the House of Lords with ""Tony's Cronies"". Two years later, he controversially lifted the lid on life in Downing Street with his autobiography, What's Left? Despite the political differences, Booth remained close to his daughter, and was with her and her husband at his constituency election count at the 2005 general election. Born in Liverpool in 1931, Booth discovered a talent for acting during his national service. As well as his role in Till Death Us Do Part, he spent a brief time on the cobbles in Coronation Street between 1960 and 1961, playing Malcolm Wilkinson. His acting career enjoyed a revival in the 1990s, with roles in Holby City, The Bill and Mersey Beat. In 1979, Booth almost burned himself to death in a fire at his flat, and he remained in hospital for months."

The ministry's Mikhail Ulyanov said the country was working ""behind the scenes"" to find a political solution, but admitted the use of sanctions against North Korea is almost exhausted. China echoed Russia's concerns, and said war on the peninsula would have ""no winners"". On Monday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said the isolated state had the right to ""shoot down"" US planes - even if they were not in the country's airspace. It followed President Trump's claim that Mr Kim may not be around much longer - a statement the foreign minister said amounted to a declaration of war. The Pentagon responded with its own threat, saying that if North Korea did not stop its provocative actions, it would make sure the ""President is provided with options to deal with Pyongyang"". However, the White House said it was ""absurd"" to suggest the US had declared war. ""We have not declared war against North Korea and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. Speaking in India, US defence secretary James Mattis stressed that the US wants to resolve the escalating nuclear crisis with North Korea diplomatically. Praising India's efforts to step up pressure on North Korea over its ""dangerous and destabilising behaviour"", Mr Mattis added: ""We maintain the capability to deter North Korea's most dangerous threats but also to back up our diplomats in a manner that keeps this as long as possible in the diplomatic realm."" Last week, in his first speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Trump vowed to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it continued to threaten the US and it allies. The Pentagon called Saturday's flight by bombers and fighter jets a ""show of force"" designed to demonstrate the range of military options available to President Trump."
2017-09-27,"A blood test that speeds up the diagnosis of heart attacks could save the NHS millions of pounds every year, according to new research.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/new-heart-attack-blood-test-could-save-nhs-millions-11055423,"The new test is much more accurate than the one currently used and could free up doctors' time and NHS beds. More than two-thirds of people who go to A&E with chest pains have not suffered a heart attack. But all of those patients undergo a blood test when they arrive and again three hours later to try and detect damage to the heart muscle. The current test works by analysing biomarkers - including cardiac troponin. Those with undetectable levels of cardiac troponin are classified as low risk and are discharged from hospital. :: Heart attack and cancer deaths could be cut by new drug But up to 85% of all patients fall into an intermediate risk group and require an overnight stay and further blood tests. Scientists from King's College London have developed a new test which looks at another biomarker - cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC) - which is more sensitive to damage in the heart muscle. Levels of cMyC in the blood increase rapidly after a heart attack - to a higher extent than troponin. The new test - which could be rolled out across the NHS in the next five years - can detect a heart attack much more rapidly and could see those not suffering a heart attack sent home sooner. The study, on more than 2,000 people in Switzerland, Italy and Spain, was funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and published in the journal Circulation. It found that the new test doubled the number of patients diagnosed as not having a heart attack. Experts worked out that just one UK hospital - St Thomas' in London which carries out 7,800 heart attack tests each year - could save £800,000 a year in reduced admissions and freed up beds. Dr Tom Kaier, one of the lead researchers, said: ""We often see patients in hospital who have to stay for further tests as a result of a mildly abnormal blood test - this is stressful and often unnecessary. ""Our research shows that the new test has the potential to reassure many thousands more patients with a single test, improving their experience and freeing up valuable hospital beds in A&E departments and wards across the country."""

And our message to the country could not be clearer: Labour is ready. :: Meet the man preparing Labour for government ""Ready to tackle inequality. Ready to rebuild our NHS... and ready to build a new and progressive relationship with Europe."" It will be his third conference leader's speech, but this one occurs against a radically different backdrop, having asserted his control over the party's decision-making bodies. He also brandishes an improved mandate after a far better than expected election result with some 12.6 million votes won for his radical manifesto at June's general election. Mr Corbyn will talk about Brexit, a subject matter for which policy making votes were avoided at this conference. But he will accuse the Government of ""self-interested Brexit bungling"". :: Corbyn 'embarrassed' by personality cult He will say: ""The Tories are more interested in posturing for personal advantage than in getting the best deal for Britain. ""Never has the national interest been so ill-served on such a vital issue... I have a simple message to the Cabinet: for Britain's sake pull yourself together or make way."" Mr Corbyn will say the Grenfell fire disaster is a monument to a ""more brutal and less caring"" society with ""disdain for the powerless and the poor"", which was ""an entirely avoidable human disaster"" that should ""haunt all politicians"". And he will call on Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi to ""end the violence"" against Rohingya in Myanamar. Looking to the future, Mr Corbyn will stress the challenges of robotics and automation which could make much work redundant. He will call it a ""threat in the hands of the greedy, but an opportunity if managed in the interest of society as a whole"". Labour's National Education Service will help retrain and reskill millions of workers whose jobs are lost to robots, he will argue. The penultimate day of conference was overshadowed by the fact that the shadow chancellor had suggested that he had looked at scenarios including there being a run on the pound in the event of a Labour election victory. But the conference has seen huge support among Labour activists for Mr Corbyn's agenda and a sidelining of MPs, as delegates have taken centre stage. Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn was asked if he was made deeply uncomfortable by the emerging cult of personality about him among his activists. He replied: ""I often think it's deeply embarrassing. It's not my wish."""

That's good news."" The reference was a clear dig at Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who has claimed Britain could have its cake and eat it when it comes to leaving the EU. On the progress of the negotiations, Mr Tusk said Brexit was an exercise in ""damage control"", adding: ""I feel now we will discuss our future relations with the UK once there is so-called sufficient progress. ""The two sides are working and we will work hard at it. ""But if you ask me, and if today member states ask me, I would say there is no sufficient progress yet. But we will work."" Arriving at Number 10 earlier, Mr Tusk described the PM's address in Florence last week as ""excellent"". In a statement after the meeting, Mrs May said her Florence speech had been intended to create ""momentum"", but it was now important for EU negotiators to ""respond in the same spirit"". In the speech she set out plans for a two-year transition period before Brexit takes full effect and promised the UK would ""honour its commitments"" on the EU budget. Mr Tusk told the PM: ""After your excellent speech in Florence I am much more optimistic. Of course, still we have to do something maybe more substantive."" Mrs May said the pair agreed that ""things have moved on"" in the Brexit process. She stressed the need for a ""good economic and security partnership"" between the UK and EU once the divorce is finalised. The PM said: ""I set out in my speech last week in Florence the hope for working together to that deep and special partnership I think we want to create with the European Union once we leave the European Union. ""And the commitment we have to looking for a really good economic partnership. ""I think that by being creative in the ways that we approach these issues we can find solutions that work both for the remaining 27 but also for the UK and maintain that co-operation and partnership between the UK and the EU."" Mr Tusk discussed progress in the exit negotiations with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier before heading to London. The fourth round of talks began in Brussels on Monday, with Brexit Secretary David Davis insisting there are ""no excuses"" for blocking progress. Mr Davis said the PM's speech set out ""concrete proposals"" and a breakthrough was now needed. But Mr Barnier insisted real progress on citizens' rights, the Irish border and the so-called ""exit bill"" was ""essential"" to move discussions to the next phase. He said he was ""keen and eager"" to see how Mrs May's speech would be turned into a negotiating strategy."

Many of these people are hidden from official statistics and, therefore, cannot receive the help they need. Their desperation can also place them in dangerous situations and they risk being abused or assaulted. Sian Berry, chair of the London Assembly housing committee, which compiled the report, said the people sleeping on the streets are ""just the tip of an iceberg"". She added: ""In fact, 13 times more Londoners are hidden and homeless than are visibly sleeping rough. ""Young people, asylum seekers and people escaping domestic violence can find it hard to get help due to gaps in current policies, and many don't even try to seek help. ""So-called sofa surfing is common and people can end up staying with virtual strangers where they are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. ""With the Homelessness Reduction Act coming soon, the housing committee wants to see more action on this problem. ""We need the Mayor and the Government to rally behind local authorities with support to reach every Londoner who needs help."" Among those affected are young people, with only one in five asking for help from their local council. Some of those who do request help are not seen as vulnerable, despite being in danger. Others affected include those ineligible for homelessness support and those escaping domestic violence. The report calls for the Government to give more funding to London's local authorities to deal with the problem and also for legislation guaranteeing an abuse victim's right to remain in their home, instead of their abuser. Terrie Alafat, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said the homelessness problem is ""acute"" in London, having risen ""steadily"" since 2010. ""To have so many people homeless in 2017 is quite simply a national disgrace and something we must act on now."""

Few industries are so utterly wedded to the courts as this one. Why? Well partly because there really aren't that many companies that manufacture big aeroplanes for the commercial world, so it's very competitive between the handful that do. The biggest of them is American - Boeing. The second biggest is European - Airbus. And then, some way behind, there's the Canadian company, Bombardier. If you want to understand the dynamics of this, though, you need to start in one place - the battle between the two giants at the top. In the star-spangled corner is Boeing, America's $250bn aviation giant, a company worth five times as much as Ford and General Motors put together. In the blue and yellow stars corner is Airbus, the European conglomerate that produces the world's biggest passenger aircraft. And between Boeing and Airbus is a wide ocean, and a deep well of mistrust. These two enormous companies live on some kind of a huge corporate see-saw. What pushes down one tends to drive up the other. Put bluntly, if an airline is somehow persuaded not to buy a Boeing, then it might well be getting an Airbus instead. Hence they've developed a protracted Tom and Jerry-style battle, constantly trying to hobble the other. It was only three weeks ago that Boeing declared victory in its latest legal bout against Airbus. The European company claimed that Boeing had received an illegal Government subsidy when it built a factory in Washington State. The World Trade Organisation first backed Airbus, and then changed its mind. Boeing declared victory; Airbus said it would fight on. Behind these companies sits the might of huge Governments. Both America and the European Union push the rules as hard as they can to support their own aviation industries. Building planes is one of those businesses that has an importance that spreads far beyond the balance sheet - it has strategic significance, employs highly-skilled people, and is allied to national prestige. Boeing has plans to tip its toes into the world of European manufacturing by opening a component factory in Sheffield but it is a wholeheartedly American company. Airbus has facilities in Alabama and China, but is seen by everyone as a European company. Bombardier is a smaller concern, but faces a familiar accusation - that the £740m investment it received from the province of Quebec was used to subsidise the cost of making the company's C-Series jets, allowing them to be sold into the American market at lower than cost price - effectively letting Bombardier unfairly ""buy"" a share of the market. Boeing's guard dogs woke up, snarled and sent off the writs. For Northern Ireland, there is the nervousness about jobs. When Bombardier took over the former Shorts factory in Belfast, it safeguarded livelihoods and also a rare skillbase. Little wonder that Theresa May, worried about the support of the DUP, got on the phone to Donald Trump and asked him to intervene. The Canadian Government, meanwhile, is also sticking up for Bombardier - it is said to have threatened to cancel a $5bn order of Boeing F1-8 fighter jets. Aviation works like that - huge legal battles, Government interference and cutting-edge engineering. Boeing and Airbus are producing planes at breakneck speed, and both are worrying about a global slowdown that could shred demand. That's why they do everything they can to protect their markets, and why Boeing has launched its missiles towards Bombardier and Belfast."
2017-09-27,A 16-year-old girl has been charged with attempted murder after a welfare officer at a school near Scunthorpe was stabbed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/girl-16-accused-of-attempted-murder-at-school-near-scunthorpe-11054889,"The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested after Joy Simon, 61, was attacked at Winterton Community Academy. She will appear before Grimsby Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, following the stabbing on Monday morning. Humberside Police said the girl has been charged with attempted murder and carrying a blade or pointed article on school premises. Chief Superintendent Christine Wilson said: ""Joy Simon is in hospital and is as well as can be expected following this serious incident. ""Her family has agreed to her being named but will not be releasing a photograph."" Ms Wilson said the school had no history of violent incidents and remained open. She said her officers responded to reports of an incident in an office in the school. Headteacher Gareth Morris described the attack as horrific. He said Mrs Simon was ""a very well regarded member of staff - a very important member of our pastoral team""."
2017-09-27,It's quite the leap from cordless vacuums to electric cars - but Dyson is in a good position to attempt the jump.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/dysons-electric-car-plan-all-about-one-thing-batteries-11054598,"The vacuum cleaner manufacturer's announcement of an electric vehicle is about one thing: batteries. Dyson has been working on battery technology for a while now, to make its vacuum cleaners last longer on a charge. Most of its products are now cordless. Last March, the company announced it was investing £1bn in battery research and development. Batteries are, of course, what electric cars run on. But more than that, they're the competitive edge for the entire industry. Every auto manufacturer, from Tesla to Jaguar Land Rover, is working on the next breakthrough. That's because, with the internal combustion engine and drivetrain removed, electric cars are radically simpler to make than traditional vehicles. James Dyson just announced to @Dyson employees that we’ve begun work on a battery electric vehicle, due to launch in 2020. pic.twitter.com/yUZNvIsYIi Analysts at JP Morgan say that the average electric vehicle has only 20 moving parts, compared to 2,000 in an internal combustion vehicle. So battery know-how becomes relatively more important than the traditional expertise of a car maker. That opens the car market to a whole host of new competitors - now including Dyson. Still, a whole new market is a big ask for any company. Making an electric car at scale and cheaply has flummoxed incumbents like Volvo and JLR, as well as disruptors like Tesla, for a while. But Dyson did a similar thing back in 2006, with the introduction of the Air Blade, the fanciest hand dryer ever developed. It looked like a bit of a punt but now it and its knock-off versions are everywhere. The same goes for its desktop fans and hairdryers. They're also built around a bit of kit that's quite useful for cars: electric motors. Dyson has been transporting its core technologies into different products and markets for some time. Electric cars are just the latest, most ambitious manifestation of that."
2017-09-27,Uber is set to fight a landmark ruling that said its drivers must be given basic employee rights.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/uber-in-landmark-appeal-after-workers-rights-ruling-11055404,"In October, drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam went to an employment tribunal saying they should be classed as workers, with access to the minimum wage, sick pay and paid holiday. They won the case but the taxi-hailing app will today begin a two-day appeal against the ruling. The appeal comes at a time when the firm is under pressure, battling TFL over its decision to strip it of its right to operate in London on the grounds it is ""not fit and proper"". The company previously argued that it was just a platform not an employer. But judges disagreed, saying: ""The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common 'platform' is to our minds faintly ridiculous. ""Drivers do not and cannot negotiate with passengers… They are offered and accept trips strictly on Uber's terms."" Uber spokesperson Fred Jones told Sky News: ""This case involves just two drivers, both of whom don't drive on the app anymore in London. ""What we see in polling is that drivers overwhelmingly want to be self employed."" Jason Moyer Lee, general secretary of IWGB union, which is helping to challenge Uber, said the final ruling could set a precedent affecting millions of other workers. ""Out of all the companies in the so-called gig economy Uber is probably the one with the biggest stomach for the fight. ""So if Uber keeps losing you're going to have smaller companies in the so-called gig economy accept that the lay of the land is worker status for these people. ""If we win enough of these cases, the companies will stop fighting and will give the minimum wage and holidays and pensions from day one."" Garry Barone and Conrad Dalphinis both drive for Uber but have very different views of their role. Mr Barone agreed with Uber, saying: ""It's very attractive to be self employed. ""Many of the drivers have more than one job. ""The attraction to Uber is because of that status, so had it not been self employed I don't think I'd have been interested."" But Mr Dalphinis disagreed, claiming the company has too much power for workers to be classed as self employed. He said: ""Because of the way we are working with Uber I'd like sick pay and holiday pay. ""I haven't had a holiday for years now."" It could be months before the appeal ruling is announced, which will only add to the uncertainty already being faced by thousands of drivers."
2017-09-27,England one day international vice-captain Ben Stokes has been dropped after being arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/england-cricket-star-ben-stokes-dropped-after-arrest-over-incident-in-bristol-11054188,"The 26-year-old was held in Bristol at 2.35am on Monday morning - hours after hitting 73 runs to help England beat West Indies. Avon and Somerset Police said the arrest followed an incident in which a 27-year-old man suffered facial injuries and was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary for treatment. Stokes remains under investigation after being released by police. Teammate Alex Hales, who was with Stokes on Sunday night, returned to Bristol on Tuesday to help officers with their inquiries. Both players have been dropped from England's squad to play West Indies at The Oval on Wednesday. The Three Lions' Ashes squad announcement is set to take place immediately before the fixture. Andrew Strauss, director of England cricket, said: ""You will understand that we cannot offer detail at this stage but will provide any updates when we can."" He added: ""Selectors have been instructed to select the Ashes squad based on form and fitness as they normally would."" Stokes is fourth in the International Cricket Council all-rounder rankings and was considered to be a certainty for England's Ashes squad. Hales is a less likely contender, having played the last of his 11 Tests more than a year ago. England one-day captain Eoin Morgan said the arrest had been ""a little bit of a distraction"" to players. ""Certainly in the past the best thing we've always been able to do is to focus on our cricket, and this instance is no different,"" he added. ""There is a little bit of a distraction outside the team, and it has the potential to affect the game tomorrow. But not letting that happen is something we can strive to do."""
2017-09-27,"Retail staff and teachers are among the unhappiest workers in the UK when it comes to their pay, according to a survey.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/who-are-the-uks-most-unhappiest-workers-11053588,"A study by jobs search engine Adzuna found that some of the happiest workers are those in human resources, consultancy and construction. The survey of 1,000 workers found that two out of five workers believed they were paid less than their colleagues, while only a fraction (6%) thought they were paid more. More than half (53%) admitted they have no idea of their true value to employers, and said they would never discuss salaries with a co-worker. :: Women managers earn 12k less than men As a result, just 13.6% said they had successfully lobbied their boss for a pay rise. Workers in their 20s were more confident in their levels of pay, while those aged 35-44 were most insecure. ""British workplaces are rife with uncertainty over pay,"" said Adzuna co-founder Doug Monro. ""An ingrained lack of transparency over earnings and salary bandings has created a culture of conviction others must be paid more than us. ""Combined with a lack of knowledge of what our own skills are worth to employers in today's job market, this spells a recipe for disaster for ambitious career builders."" Official data from the Office of National Statistics earlier this month pointed to the lowest jobless rate since 1975 - but wage growth remained stubbornly slow at 2.1%."

""Their MP thinks the system is ridiculous,"" she told delegates at a Labour conference fringe event entitled Reigning in the Monarchy. ""We should not be funding them."" The Duke and Duchess live in Kensington Palace, a royal residence in one of the most affluent parts of the borough. Ms Dent Coad also complained it was ""disgusting"" the Duchess of Cambridge had bought jumpers at an estimated cost of £150 each when ""that's a food bill for a family of four"", adding: ""That's absolutely outrageous."" She also attacked the BBC for producing ""sickeningly gratuitous coverage of anything royal"" and accused the broadcaster of being ""very heavily directed by right-wing politics and the monarchy"". ""It is a piece of the whole propaganda machine,"" she said. Ms Dent Coad won the Kensington seat in June's general election, her slim majority of 20 giving Labour its first win in the constituency. She was thrust into the limelight almost immediately after the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed around 80 people. London Mayor Sadiq Khan called her an ""amazing advocate for the neglected residents"" who were left devastated by the disaster."
2017-09-27,A psychopathic killer has been jailed for at least 39 years for torturing a man to death -  as a judge asked how police failed to spot it was murder for two years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170927075038/http://news.sky.com/story/psychopath-who-tortured-man-to-death-is-jailed-11054343,"Jason Marshall posed as an MI5 agent before stripping, gagging, handcuffing and smothering 58-year-old Peter Fasoli with cling film. The ordeal, after the pair met on a dating website, lasted for six hours and was caught on a camera at the victim's home. Mr Fasoli, a computer repairman, could be heard begging for his life on the film. But Marshall threatened to cut his tongue out unless he gave him his bank cards and PIN numbers, the Old Bailey heard. To cover his tracks, Marshall set fire to Mr Fasoli's bungalow in Northolt, west London, leaving him for dead, in January 2013. The 29-year-old attacker then stole nearly £800 from his victim and fled to Rome in Italy - where he killed again. He also attacked a third man in his own home in Italy before being caught. For nearly two years, Mr Fasoli's death was put down to an accident. However, his nephew stumbled across harrowing webcam footage of the killing on his uncle's computer hard drive. During his trial, Marshall told the jury he could not remember the attack, which was replayed in the court. In the disturbing footage, Myleene Klass's Classic FM show can be heard in the background. On Tuesday, Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC sentenced Marshall to life with a minimum of 39 years for murder. He said: ""I am sure you were motivated by a desire to cause Mr Fasoli pain without his consent, which would be a significantly greater source of pleasure or gratification to you. ""You tortured him for so long because you enjoyed it so much. ""I'm sure that you can have felt no remorse whatsoever for what you have done. ""On the contrary, you derived pleasure from it."" Judge Hilliard asked for more information about why the initial police investigation did not examine Mr Fasoli's bank records or social media activity. These eventually revealed Mr Fasoli's bank card had been used after his death, as well as details about the pair's date. He said: ""I express the hope that someone who is in a position to do so, so far as the Metropolitan Police is concerned, will look at whether procedures for investigations are significantly comprehensive and robust in such circumstances."" Prosecutor Ed Brown QC told the court a detective superintendent looked ""very carefully"" at what happened and found there was ""no breach of any procedure"". Marshall, from East Ham, east London, is already serving 16 years for the attacks in Italy. He showed no reaction as he was sent down. In mitigation, his lawyer Tomas Quinn said he had a ""bizarre"" history of impersonating police officers, ticket inspectors and special constables. Detective Inspector James Stevenson, of Scotland Yard, said: ""He is clearly a very sadistic individual. ""He has a psychopathic personality disorder but does not have a treatable mental illness."""
