""The investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further enquiries,"" senior coroner Darren Salter said in a statement. :: Celebrity deaths: The big names mourned in 2016 According to the British Heart Foundation, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is ""a disease of your heart muscle where it becomes stretched and thin"". This means that it is unable to efficiently pump blood. Possible causes for the disease include viral infections, high blood pressure, problems with heart valves, excessive amounts of alcohol and pregnancy. The post-mortem had been deemed ""inconclusive"" by Thames Valley Police in December, with officers adding at the time his death was ""still being treated as unexplained but not suspicious"". The 53-year-old star was found dead at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on Christmas Day. His partner, Fadi Fawaz, said he found the singer dead in bed when he arrived to wake him. His publicist also confirmed at the time there were no suspicious circumstances. Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in 1963. He sold more than 100 million albums, firstly as a member of Wham!, then as a solo artist."
2017-03-08,A rhino has been shot dead by poachers who broke into a zoo and sliced its horn off with a chainsaw.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/rhino-shot-dead-at-paris-zoo-by-poachers-who-chainsawed-its-horn-off-10793683,"Four-year-old Vince was found dead by one of his keepers at Thoiry zoo, near Paris, on Tuesday morning. One or more attackers are believed to have broken into the zoo in the night. The rhino was shot three times in the head, French investigators said. Staff at the zoo are said to be ""extremely shocked"" and an investigation into the ""massacre"" is under way. Vince's second horn was partially cut, which the zoo said suggested either his attackers were disturbed or their chainsaw stopped working. ""This odious act was perpetrated despite the presence of five members of the zoological staff living on the spot and surveillance cameras,"" the zoo wrote on its Facebook page. ""The other two white rhinoceros living in Thoiry, Gracie aged 37 and Bruno aged five years, escaped the massacre and are safe."" It is believed to be the first attack off its kind at a zoo in Europe, the post added. Vince was born in late 2012 at Burger Zoo in The Netherlands and had been at Thoiry, situated 30 miles west of Paris, since March 2015. France's environment minister Segolene Royal said: ""The killing of a rhinoceros at Thoiry is criminal. ""It is time countries outlaw the trade in ivory and horn as I have done in France."" Ivory horns can be sold on the black market for tens of thousands of pounds. Southern African countries are battling increased poaching levels as organised gangs from mainly Asian countries try to meet the growing demand from countries such as Vietnam and China."
2017-03-08,"Sometimes when we journalists say things like ""this is no ordinary Budget"", we do it to try to get you excited. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/budget-why-chancellor-philip-hammond-is-aiming-for-no-thrills-10794027,"As in: ""This is no ordinary Budget... it'll be chock full of so many measures it'll change your life forever. So pay attention!"" This week, when you hear someone say ""this is no ordinary Budget"", I'm afraid it means something else. Unless Philip Hammond surprises us all, this will be a far thinner, less exciting Budget than most. :: Live - Hammond to deliver first Budget It might, by some measures, feel even less interesting than last November's Autumn Statement. After all, back then we had yet to learn how the Office for Budget Responsibility would react to the Brexit vote (they did so by cutting the outlook for UK GDP growth this year from 2.2% to 1.4%). :: Sky News will have live coverage and analysis of the Chancellor's Budget from 12.30pm, with a special programme starting at 10am This time around they will probably increase their in-year forecast a bit, but they are unlikely to map out the precise long-term impact of leaving the single market, since they can legitimately say there's no point in doing so until we know what kind of a deal we negotiate. If I'm wrong on this, which is quite possible, then I take back the stuff above about this being a boring Budget. The main reason this Budget will feel a bit like an Autumn Statement is because that's precisely what Mr Hammond wants. :: Chancellor set to hold back on Budget giveaways When he became Chancellor he decided to change the political timetable so that the Budget would take place in the autumn, with the Autumn Statement moved to the spring. For constitutional reasons (something to do with the political timetable) he couldn't cancel this year's spring Budget. The upshot is that this Budget is a bit of a charade. :: Budget brief: What to expect from the Chancellor Yes, there will be some eye-catching stuff: more money for schools, more for social care and businesses struggling to pay their rates. But if you're expecting any far-reaching reforms of the UK economy, you've picked the wrong event. But that suits the Chancellor. Unlike most of his predecessors, Mr Hammond has shown little interest, thus far at least, in fiddling with the economy or pulling rabbits out of hats. He does not see himself as a social reformer, like Gordon Brown and George Osborne. But he would like to improve the tax system. He would like to make it simpler. He would like, in the case of corporation tax, to make it work. Such things take time, and lots of forethought. So while this Budget won't change the state of the economy overnight, it might give us a hint of the direction of travel. We may get promises of a big look at social care and at corporation tax - though for the time being that means commissioning some new reviews rather than actually doing anything. However, the main priority at the Treasury this month is to do as little as possible. Before you assume that that makes this a total non-event, don't be fooled. For beneath the surface some important political manoeuvrings are occurring. While the Treasury is still determined to try to reduce the deficit as quickly as possible, the same thing could not be said about Number 10. So in an odd way, the less extra spending there is tomorrow, the bigger the achievement from the Treasury's perspective. Keep a particular eye on how much of the deficit reduction gets banked by the Government - and how much gets spent. If the majority is left in the bank, that means Mr Hammond has won a very important battle indeed. The more boring it is, the better he is doing."
2017-03-08,Chancellor Philip Hammond has received a pre-Budget boost as the OECD upgraded the UK's growth forecast for this year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/boost-for-hammond-as-oecd-upgrades-uk-growth-forecast-to-16-10793868,"The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pencilled in expansion of 1.6%, up from its previous estimate of 1.2% in November. But the Paris-based think-tank stuck to its prediction that the pace would slow to 1% next year as Brexit negotiations intensify and rising inflation dampens consumer spending. The rise in the cost of living has been driven higher by the collapse in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. The OECD report came a day ahead of updated forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), to be revealed as Mr Hammond delivers his Budget. The OBR is also expected to upgrade its outlook for the UK. Britain's economy performed better than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote last year, though gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.8% for 2016 was still a slowdown on 2015's 2.2%. Economic indicators for the start of this year have pointed to further deterioration. The OECD revised its forecasts in its interim economic outlook. It said: ""In the United Kingdom, the pace of expansion in 2016 was lower than in previous years, despite support from resilient household spending, actions by the Bank of England and adjustment to the fiscal stance following the Brexit vote. ""UK growth is expected to ease further as rising inflation weighs on real incomes and consumption, and business investment weakens amidst uncertainty about the United Kingdom's future trading relations with its partners."""
2017-03-08,A Turkish man who shot dead a British toddler in Turkey 14 years ago has been shot and killed at his own wedding.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/turkish-man-who-murdered-toddler-alistair-grimason-is-shot-dead-at-own-wedding-10793774,"Two-year-old Alistair Grimason was asleep in his pram at a cafe in Foca in 2003 when he was hit by a bullet fired by Daimi Akyuz. The following year, Akyuz, now 46, was sentenced to life for killing Alistair and another man after a gunfight broke out. He was released early and on Saturday, just six days after his release, he was gunned down at his own wedding in Izmir, according to reports in Turkish media. Turkish police are interviewing five suspects over the shooting. The toddler's father, David Grimason, from East Kilbride, said the news did not give him any satisfaction: ""I don't take any joy in what has happened. ""I would rather that he was in prison and being punished for what he did. ""I was told that he was at his wedding and stepped outside for a cigarette and someone came along and shot him."" Mr Grimason has since split up from Alistair's Turkish-born mother Ozlem, who has moved back to Izmir. He added: ""Ozlem has moved back to Turkey recently, so there was an opportunity they could have bumped in to each other. ""It is a horrible thought. No-one informed us that he was being let out. ""We were told at the time he would serve his full sentence. They were making an example of him. ""It was a tough time for us. But it's worse for his family at the moment, I remember he had two kids."" On the evening of 7 July 2003, Alistair and his mother and grandmother had been at a cafe in Foca, about an hour from Izmir. Car salesman and taxi driver Akyuz, who was at a nearby table, pulled a gun on three other men, killing Ali Bektas, a mobile phone salesman, and injuring two other men. Alistair was caught in the crossfire and died instantly when a stray bullet pierced his lung. Akyuz was found guilty of murder and ordered to serve a maximum of 36 years. He admitted causing Alistair's death but denied murder. However a judge found him guilty of deliberately killing the toddler. Akyuz, who insisted that the gun had gone off after others grabbed his hand, failed in a court appeal against his sentence. Alistair's father went on to campaign for tighter gun controls, even visiting the United Nations in New York to help secure an international arms trade treaty. Akyuz's early release is reported to have been the result of mass arrests following Turkey's failed coup last year, which has left prisons ""overflowing"", according to sources in the country."
2017-03-08,"Peers have backed an amendment to the Brexit bill which demands a ""meaningful"" vote on Theresa May's final deal with the EU.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-bill-defeated-for-second-time-as-lords-call-for-meaningful-vote-10793889,"A total of 366 voted for an amendment to the bill to trigger Article 50, with 268 voting against. It proposes that the Prime Minister would not be able to finalise a deal with the European Union without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Under the amendment, Mrs May would also require the prior approval of MPs and Lords if she decides to conclude talks ""without an agreement as to the applicable terms"". It is the second time in a week the Lords have defeated the Brexit bill - on Wednesday a Labour amendment demanding protection for EU citizens in the UK was passed by a majority of 102. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the outcome of the amendment vote was ""disappointing"". He said: ""(The bill) has a straightforward purpose - to enact the referendum result and allow the Government to get on with negotiating a new partnership with the EU. ""It is clear that some in the Lords would seek to frustrate that process and it is the Government's intention to ensure that does not happen. ""We will now aim to overturn these amendments in the House of Commons."" Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown described the second amendment as a chance for the Commons ""to think again"". Lord Ashdown told Sky News: ""This is about the sovereignty of Parliament, the Prime Minister was trying to get away without Parliament having a say - we've insisted it should. ""What else is democracy about?"" He added: ""The Government have abused the people's vote, they have hijacked the Brexit referendum result for the hardest possible Brexit, the one that leaves us the most distant from the European Union."" With the Prime Minister vowing to trigger Article 50 before the end of March, senior peers now expect ""ping pong"" on Monday, with the Lords amendments being debated - and thrown out - by MPs in the Commons in the afternoon. The bill would then return to the Lords that evening, when peers are expected to end their demands for changes and allow the legislation to reach the statute book."
2017-03-08,"E.On has become the latest Big Six energy supplier to announce an increase in its standard tariff, following Npower, ScottishPower and EDF.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/eon-to-raise-standard-energy-prices-by-average-88-from-april-10793564,"The company confirmed an average 8.8% increase from 26 April - saying the move would affect 2.5 million customers unless they changed contract or supplier. It gave a breakdown of the additional charges by saying standard electricity prices would rise by an average of 13.8% and standard gas prices by 3.8%. E.On blamed cost increases ""it doesn't control"", with the bulk of the rise down to a 36% hike in the cost of supporting various social and environmental programmes, such as the Renewables Obligation and Electricity Market Reform. Chief executive Tony Cocker said: ""This is the first time since January 2014 that we have increased our standard variable prices. ""It is an announcement we never want to make but is due in large part to the fact that many of the costs we don't directly control, such as policies including EMR, RO and the Energy Company Obligation (ECO), which are paid for via people's energy bills, are increasing. ""We have been able to partially offset some of these rises through our wholesale hedging policy and other means, but we do have to make an increase."" E.On said it would be writing customers as part of efforts to ensure they were on the best tariff for them. The price comparison service, uSwitch, said customers could avoid higher standard charges - and save themselves up to £618 annually - by switching account. SSE is the only member of the Big Six yet to declare where its prices are going. British Gas confirmed a month ago it would freeze standard prices until August."

A reform to the tax treatment of the self-employed is expected to raise hundreds of millions of pounds. The Chancellor will not present his debut red box outside Number 11 with a deluge of extra red ink. He will hold back about £50bn of fiscal space against his watered-down fiscal rules to deal with a possible future deterioration in public finances during the Brexit process. :: Sky News will have live coverage and analysis of the Chancellor's Budget from 12.30pm, with a special programme starting at 10am But Mr Hammond, who has been meeting with Conservative MPs concerned about funding in a variety of public services, faces a key challenge as the impact of years of spending cuts start to be seen publicly. :: Why Hammond is aiming for a no-thrills Budget The long-term focus will also be evident in a series of reviews into thorny public policy issues from social care to business rates. An extra £1bn to £1.5bn will be found to fund immediate social care pressures. Rolling reviews of three to four years will also be announced on social care and business rates for council funding. There is some expectation of a change to the way funding formulae for a variety of local services are calculated, including changes to ""needs-based"" systems. Faced with the threat of a revolt by Tory MPs, he will also find funds to help firms hit by the sharpest rises in business rates, and he is also looking to overhaul the whole business rates system. The Chancellor will also announce a new £5m fund in the Budget for women's equality projects, to mark the upcoming centenary of legislation which gave women the right to vote. :: Budget brief - What to expect from the Chancellor A Sky Data survey found most people disagreed with this decision. Some 61% thought he should spend the money on things such as the NHS, while just 34% agreed with his savings plan. The survey also suggests 49% supported ending austerity, with only 27% opposed to ending it. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News he expected the Government to do more in the Budget. He said: ""They're living in a different world. People are suffering at the moment. ""Stagnating wages, prices increasing because of inflation, insecure work, cuts to public services - they've got to address those issues."" Mr Hammond will set out plans for £500m in additional spending on education, with £320m for 140 new free schools - including new grammars promised by Theresa May. He will say that the Government will invest in young people's ability to go to a good school, achieve good qualifications and get the right skills ""equipping them for the jobs of tomorrow"".

Detective Superintendent Katie Elliott said the search of a landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire was ""the next logical step to try to find Corrie"" after the details of the rubbish collection were clarified. In a message on the Find Corrie Facebook page, the 22-year-old gunner's mother wrote: ""With the weight of the bin that was lifted the night Corrie went missing has been incorrect and the true weight is over 100kg. This can really devastatingly only mean one thing. ""I can only pray that Corrie is found quickly and that we are able to get answers as to how this could have happened. ""Please can I ask everyone on here to try really hard not to speculate just now. Each second waiting to find Corrie is torture enough. ""This page was set up to find Corrie. We still need to do this."" Mr McKeague, who was stationed at RAF Honington in Suffolk, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds in the early hours of 24 September 2016. CCTV showed him going into the 'Horseshoe' at 3.25am. Later in the day there was a rubbish collection from the area. It has also been confirmed that a 26-year-old man arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice would face no further action."

After the amendment passed with a majority of 98, Lord Heseltine was told that the Prime Minister was firing him from his roles in advising the Government on a number of issues, including its industrial strategy. Following his dismissal, the Tory grandee told Sky News: ""I have been working for the Government now for six years. It has been a privilege. ""Of course I'm very sad and sorry to see it go - but in the end you have to be true to yourself and I knew I had to make that speech today in the House of Lords. ""None of us can see what governments we're going to be dealing with in Europe. We can't see what the circumstances are going to be, we can't see what the deal is going to be.

That's what the Brexit people have been saying along: 'We've got to have sovereignty back.'"" Lord Heseltine also warned that European governments will not offer the UK a good deal, as it could spark other EU members to leave. The former deputy prime minister has said he is not interested in sparking a ""constitutional crisis"" if the Commons decides to reject the amendment submitted by the Lords. ""We're not trying to overrule the Commons, or become an equal partner to the Commons, we're merely doing what the House of Lords traditionally is expected to do, which is to ask the Commons to think again,"" he added. Prior to the vote, the former deputy prime minister had warned that quitting the European Union was the ""most momentous peacetime decision of our time"".

2017-03-08,"A new campaign is urging boys to open up about their emotions, following research which suggests they are six times less likely than girls to seek support for suicidal feelings.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/boys-urged-to-open-up-about-suicidal-feelings-by-new-campaign-10793258,"ChildLine says it delivered 1,934 counselling sessions for boys, compared with 11,463 for girls - however, national figures show the number of suicides among young men is considerably higher. Official figures from across the UK in 2015 show there were 168 deaths attributable to suicide among boys aged 10 to 19, and 63 deaths among girls in the same age range. It is hoped the Tough to Talk campaign will help boys struggling with suicidal feelings to realise they can seek support from ChildLine if they are unable to talk to friends or family. Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said: ""For boys in particular, it can be harder to ask for help due to a reluctance to talk about their feelings, but this could be stopping boys from accessing support when they most need it. ""We hope that by putting the spotlight on male suicide, we can help boys see that they are not alone."" Boys who did get in touch with the NSPCC-run ChildLine during 2015/16 discussed a wide range of issues with counsellors beyond feeling suicidal - including abuse, relationship concerns, bullying, sexuality, gender identity, and mental health issues. Footballer Wayne Rooney is among those supporting the new campaign. The Manchester United captain, who is an NSPCC ambassador, said: ""Growing up in the world of football, I know there can be a stigma attached to young men showing emotion and talking about their feelings. ""It can be seen as a weakness but the opposite is true and it takes great strength to open up and reach out for help. ""They don't need to suffer in silence. I would encourage any young person struggling with suicidal thoughts to talk to someone they trust or contact ChildLine."" :: Young people aged 18 and under can call Childline on 0800 1111, or visit www.childline.org.uk :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can also call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK."

He also wants to tool up the nation for leaving the EU. And Theresa May wants some grammar schools. :: Live - Budget 2017 Here's what we expect: :: NHS and social care A £1.3bn cash injection is expected amid an NHS crisis exacerbated by problems caring for the elderly and disabled in their own homes. It is estimated there will be a £2.6bn blackhole in the social care budget by 2020. The extra money is a sticking plaster and a long-term review of social care is expected to be announced. Labour has called for £12bn to be ploughed into the NHS. :: Cigarettes and alcohol Look for increases in cigarette and alcohol duty. The cheapest packet of cigarettes is forecast to increase to £8.68. :: Brexit The Chancellor is building a £60bn Brexit fighting fund/war chest/safety net. Economists expected him to announce a £45bn windfall over the next five years from tax receipts. Mr Hammond says he is stashing this away - not spending it. :: Education A £500m education boost for 140 new free schools, including a new generation of grammar schools, and for refurbishing existing schools. There is also expected to be £500m for technical education, introducing 'T-levels' to provide skills that businesses say are currently lacking and to prepare for Brexit needs. It is billed by the Government as the biggest shake-up of over-16s education in 70 years. :: Technology Another half a billion is destined for high-tech investment: for trailblazers in the areas of artificial intelligence and robotics, and for the roll out of super-fast 5G mobile phone services. :: Growth Economists expected 2017 growth to be revised from 1.4% to 1.9%. :: Taxes The Chancellor cannot raise income tax, VAT or national insurance contributions because of pledges in the manifesto. Instead, it has been suggested Mr Hammond might increase National Insurance contributions for the self-employed by 3p in the pound to bring them in line with those paid by employees at 12%. :: Property There is pressure on the Chancellor to shake up stamp duty, which has failed to keep pace with the increase in property prices. Also some property experts have suggested there could be some ""bells and whistles"" on existing help for first-time buyers. :: Business The Chancellor has promised measures to help those firms hardest hit by the first review of business rates in seven years, which has left some facing increases of 400%. There are significant concerns high street shops and pubs face closure, while internet giants such as Amazon with big out-of-town warehouses benefit from cheaper rates. :: Petrol Petrol prices have risen sharply since this time last year and it is expected that the fuel duty freeze will continue. However, the Chancellor is understood to have been mulling the idea of incentivising drivers to get rid of highly polluting diesel vehicles. :: Netflix and Phil? There could be a crackdown on small print being used to mislead customers. Also, there will be an end to deals where customers are offered a free trial, asked for their payment details and then fail to cancel in appropriate time and get billed, as used by the likes of Amazon and Netflix. :: Watch full coverage of the Chancellor's first Budget on Sky News from 10am"

",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/courts-to-consider-young-offenders-backgrounds-when-sentencing-10793392,"New guidelines, to be introduced in England and Wales on 1 June, will emphasise the need to avoid criminalising under-18s unnecessarily. The Sentencing Council says offending by a young person is ""often a phase"" which ""passes fairly rapidly"", and that a custodial sentence should be viewed as a ""last resort"". Certain factors that are regularly present in the background of youngsters who come before the courts include deprived homes and poor parental employment records, the guidance says. The youngsters may also have been exposed to drug or alcohol abuse. In addition to mitigation, ""aggravating"" factors will also be taken into account when offenders aged from 10 to 17 are sentenced. For the first time, these will include the deliberate humiliation of a victim when an offence is filmed and the intention is to post it on social media. Chairman of the Sentencing Council, Lord Treacy, said: ""Our guideline on the sentencing of children and young people has the prevention of reoffending at its heart. ""No one wants children who commit offences going on to become adult criminals. ""The guideline therefore looks with far greater detail at what kind of sentence would prevent this based on the age, background and circumstances of each child or young person, so that it can help them reintegrate instead of becoming alienated further."" The Council has also published specific guidance for courts dealing with youngsters who have been convicted of sexual offences and robbery. On sex crimes, it says: ""Offending can arise through inappropriate sexual experimentation; gang or peer group pressure to engage in sexual activity; or a lack of understanding regarding consent, exploitation, coercion and appropriate sexual behaviour."" More than a third (37.9%) of young people commit a new offence within a year of being released from custody. The Government is planning to introduce ""secure schools"" as part of a number of measures intended to reduce re-offending rates."

The so-called ""weeping angel"" programme would trick users into thinking their TV was off when it was actually on, it is claimed. WikiLeaks says the documents show smart TVs were then used as a bug ""recording conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a covert CIA server"". WikiLeaks described the development as an ""emblematic realisation"" of George Orwell's 1984 - a novel which imagines how TV screens could be used to monitor the every move of citizens. It is claimed a different CIA unit produced malware to ""infest, control and exfiltrate"" data from iPhones and iPads, while a similar team is said to target Google's Android operating system - allowing agents to ""bypass"" the encryption of messaging apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram. :: What is in WikiLeaks' 'Vault 7' release of 'CIA' documents? WikiLeaks adds that the US intelligence agency ""runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware"". Meanwhile, it is also alleged the CIA looked into ""infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks"", allowing it to ""engage in nearly undetectable assassinations"". The CIA said it would not comment ""on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents"". WikiLeaks says it obtained the ""Vault 7"" collection of 8,761 documents and files after they were circulated among former US government hackers and contractors ""in an unauthorised manner"". It added that ""Vault 7"" is the largest intelligence leak in the CIA's history which shows the ""scope and direction"" of the agency's ""global covert hacking programme"". In a statement, WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange described the spread of cyber weapons as an ""extreme risk"". He said: ""Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade."" WikiLeaks and its allies have embarrassed Washington before. Previous releases of classified material have included hundreds of thousands of documents from the Pentagon and the State Department."

Police said officers were called to reports of a serious collision in the grounds of the hospital just after 2pm on Tuesday. Two women were taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. Greater Manchester Police later said they had both subsequently died. The driver of the vehicle, a man in his 80s, was arrested at the scene. He is being held on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and serious injury by dangerous driving. Senior Investigating Officer Sergeant Lee Westhead, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: ""My thoughts go out to anyone affected by this tragic incident. ""An investigation has commenced to establish the circumstances. ""We are in the very early stages of the investigation and I would urge anyone who witnessed the collision, or saw the vehicle beforehand, to contact my team as soon as possible.""

She said one casualty was taken to Wythenshawe hospital and one to Manchester Royal Infirmary."
2017-03-08,"The leader of Surrey County Council has been secretly recorded telling colleagues he had secured a ""gentleman's agreement"" with ministers on social care. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/surrey-council-leaders-social-care-gentlemans-agreement-revealed-10794031,"David Hodge is heard telling them he had spoken directly to the local government secretary, who intervened with the Chancellor, before calling off a damaging referendum to raise council tax. Mr Hodge and Downing Street last month both denied there was a ""sweetheart"" deal to get more social care funding for Surrey after it was raised with Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions. But in a leaked recording obtained by Sky News, Mr Hodge explains he has called off his demand for a 15% rise. The council opted for a 4.99% hike instead, which does not require a referendum. ""There may come a time, if what I call gentleman's agreements the Conservative Party often does, are not honoured, we will have to revisit this in nine months or a year's time,"" he says. ""If we do, let me assure you that you'll have to drag me kicking and screaming not to go for a referendum next year."" Mr Hodge continues: ""A series of conversations took place with the secretary of state for local government in his car outside Number 10 Downing Street looking for assurances, looking for clarification, looking for help basically for how we can stop the referendum. ""He then went inside and spoke to the Chancellor and his adviser … then the spad (special adviser) rang me with what we can and cannot say. There are certain things we cannot say, and yes there are certain risks to the decision we decided to go with."" He adds: ""But every one of us knows in this room that we have what we call a gentleman's agreement with the Chancellor and the secretary of state."" Mr Hodge warns colleagues not to discuss the arrangement publicly. Gareth Thomas, Labour's spokesman for local government finance, said: ""Theresa May and her ministers, including Sajid Javid, have been playing political games, conducting backroom sweetheart deals for their friends, whilst councils across the country struggle to cobble together the money to adequately fund social care. ""Theresa May must come clean about the terms of the deal offered to Surrey County Council, apologise for her Government's misleading suggestion that there had been no such deal and ensure other local councils get the same treatment."" Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: ""This was denied by both sides. The PM called this 'alternative facts'. She should now come to the House of Commons and apologise."" Mr Hodge told Sky News it was ""deceitful"" of a colleague to record the private meeting and make it public. But he said: ""There's nothing I can do about it. I'm straight and honest. All I ever wanted is the best for the people of Surrey, I make no apology about that."" He said he had previously been asked by fellow councillors ""to go and negotiate with the Government for the best deal we can get"". The meeting of the Conservative group on the council is understood to have been held in late January, on the day the council signed off its annual budget. In the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn accused the Prime Minister of giving Surrey a special deal, while other councils across the country were left struggling. In a statement, Mr Javid's department said Surrey was taking part in a pilot scheme to allow the council to fund social care from business rates from next year. Mr Hodge insisted it was not a special deal for Surrey council, in which a number of cabinet ministers have constituencies, and that other councils may be granted the same arrangement in the Budget. Social care is expected to get a funding boost of £1.3bn in the Budget, after a number of Conservative MPs and councillors expressed concerns that the sector was in crisis financially."
2017-03-08,"Northern Ireland was created to give Unionists a built-in majority, to protect their interests.  ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170308090317/http://news.sky.com/story/the-obstacles-facing-northern-ireland-now-unionism-is-no-longer-in-a-majority-10789357,"For half a century it was virtually a one-party state, with no one able to challenge the domination of the Ulster Unionists. That changed in Thursday's election. The Ulster Unionist Party has shrunk to fourth place in terms of elected members. Its leader, Mike Nesbitt, resigned before all the votes had even been counted. And the Democratic Unionists (DUP), who became the biggest force in Northern Ireland politics a decade ago, now have only a one seat advantage over Sinn Fein. But for a community which has also had something of a siege mentality, the biggest shock for Ulster Protestants is that Unionism is no longer in a majority. Nationalists and republicans, those who favour a united Ireland, plus those like the Alliance Party and The Greens who consider themselves independent, can now out-vote the Unionists. The DUP used to be the only party big enough to trigger a Petition of Concern - effectively a veto on issues they didn't support such as marriage equality. You need 30 votes to do that; they now only have 28. How this changes day-to-day politics in Stormont will be fascinating to watch, but at the moment, it's a moot point. The parties have three weeks to try to come together to form a new power-sharing executive, but there seems little prospect of that happening given the breakdown in trust between the DUP and Sinn Fein. Arch-rivals Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness found a way to forge a partnership, so why can't Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill, the next generation of unionist and republican leaders, strike a deal? Sinn Fein voters have increasingly felt frustrated at what they regarded as the arrogance of the former first minister. She in turn called Sinn Fein crocodiles who demanded more no matter how regularly they were fed. Well, they now have a fresh mandate to demand a better deal on issues which are important to them such as an Irish Language Act. And then there's Brexit. The DUP were enthusiastic Leavers of the EU. Sinn Fein backed Remain, and have serious concerns about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland, where a majority voted in favour to continued membership. The UK's only land border with a European neighbour has become virtually invisible since the Good Friday Agreement, and those who favour Irish unity will fight any restrictions or new border controls. Sinn Fein may even use the election result to push for a referendum on Irish unity, even though such a request is likely to be rejected. All these are big obstacles to striking a new power-sharing deal. And until temperatures cool, Westminster may have to pass legislation to take back control of Northern Ireland affairs. Sinn Fein's election mantra was that there should be no return to the status quo. But the long-term alternative of a mothballed Stormont is equally unpalatable."

The court was told Mr Paterson had previously carried out a number of procedures on her to remove lumps from both breasts. The lumps - which she described as uncomfortable rather than excessively painful - turned out to be benign fatty tissue, the court heard. Mrs Conduit told Nottingham Crown Court: ""He (Paterson) said he could not keep removing the lumps because he was removing too much breast tissue and the only way forward would be to have a bilateral mastectomy."" Mr Paterson is alleged to have told her that there was ""no known cure"" and that she was only the third person he had seen during his career with the condition. After the mastectomy, in July 2001, Mrs Conduit had to be rushed to another hospital after a blood clot was discovered close to her heart during the procedure - because surgeons did not have the correct implements to remove it. The court heard she was left with a ""black and rotting"" wound and had to spend 10 days in Solihull Hospital. As part of her recovery, she had to visit the hospital 94 times in the 12 months after the operation. On discovering further lumps in 2008, Mrs Conduit returned to Solihull for it to be removed and was told although the lump was benign that there was breast tissue left. She said: ""I believed for 10 years I had no breast tissue left because I was assured Ian Paterson had removed it all and I would never get breast cancer."" Philip Drew, a senior lecturer in general surgery at the University of Hull, said that while some of the operations carried out would appear reasonable, he believed the mastectomy was not. He told the court: ""In my opinion, the mastectomy was too much surgery for what was in effect recurrent fat necrosis."" Mr Drew also said he believed Mrs Conduit's condition had been ""mislabelled"" as Dercum's disease. Ian Paterson was formerly employed by Heart of England NHS Trust and also practised at Spire Healthcare. Jurors have previously heard claims he carried out completely unnecessary operations for ""obscure motives"" that may have included a desire to ""earn extra money"". He is standing trial after denying 20 counts of wounding with intent against nine women and one man relating to procedures he carried out between 1997 and 2011. He denies the charges. The trial continues."

It later reported a 25% fall in half-year profits - with damage also coming from a challenging trading environment amid a row with MPs over working practices at its main warehouse. In its latest announcement, Sports Direct warned it was facing financial damage from the devaluation of the euro against the US dollar. Sports Direct, which buys its goods in dollars, said its existing hedging position - which essentially protects it from the euro's fall - was due to expire at the end of April. Its statement said: ""In response to certain inquiries received by the company in relation to currency, we continue to believe the devaluation of the euro against the dollar will impact on gross margin. ""Our euro/dollar exchange rate is currently hedged at 1.46, which is due to expire at the end of full year 2017 and we currently have no euro/dollar hedging in place for full year 2018."" The euro is currently worth $1.06. Investors in Sports Direct have endured a rollercoaster - with shares losing more than a quarter of their value over the past 12 months as profit warnings and negative headlines took hold. A corporate governance row, in the wake of the PR disaster over treatment of staff, has seen Mr Ashley twice ride to the rescue of chairman Keith Hellawell - using his voting rights to spare him the axe. Mr Hellawell has said he will resign if investors fail to be impressed by its turnaround efforts come the next annual general meeting. Sports Direct shares pared back some of their losses by the close on Tuesday but were still 5% lower at the close."

Giles told the Radio Times: ""On frosty and snowy nights, does the forecaster really need to tell people to watch out on untreated roads and pavements? ""I think they could safely just mention the ice and expect viewers to use their common sense."" He continued: ""Of course, if the forecast is for exceptionally severe weather, which happens about once every five years, then due warnings and possible consequences must be given. ""But to do this with all of the dozen or so named winter storms risks making people immune to the warnings. ""And just because we're now into spring, at least where weather forecasters are concerned, it doesn't mean the warnings will stop. ""We have yet to get the summer thunderstorms and consequent flooding as well as a warning of impending heatwaves. ""So while we must consider the effects of severe weather on the population at large rather than just pure weather information, for weather warnings to be effective our forecasters must beware of behaving like nannies."" Sky News weather producer, Christopher England, said Giles ""does have a point"". ""It is possible to cry wolf too often, but at the same time there is a need to point out some of the implications of severe weather,"" he said. ""Such things as the naming of storms are an attempt to provide an authoritative indication that something is beyond the usual range of windy weather. ""As with all such things, it's a matter of trying to achieve a suitable balance between nannying and providing sufficient information to people."" Giles concluded his magazine article with his own forecast for the weeks ahead, predicting mild weather and rain for March, with a chance of damaging frosts into April. ""Which, as a gardener, is the one weather warning I do really want to hear,"" he added."

It is thought the alleged attacks took place between 3 February and 5 March, when the woman, also 22, was rescued. She stumbled badly bruised and ""almost zombie-like"" into a remote petrol station in the Australian outback, about 350 miles away from Brisbane. The owner of the petrol station, Beverley Page, called police after she left without paying for fuel, and they later pulled her over on the Warrego Highway at Mitchell. Ms Page said: ""She was very frightened. She was upset and she was shaking, and she had two black eyes and marks on her throat. ""She just seemed too upset at the time to be just upset about a wallet and not being able to pay for fuel."" The woman told officers that she had been held captive by a man she had met at a party in Cairns, and had been travelling around the state in the car since 2 January. Martin, from the Manunda suburb of Cairns, was arrested after he was found stowed in the boot underneath a pile of clothing. He appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences - including four counts of rape, eight counts of assault and four counts of strangulation. His alleged victim was treated for injuries including facial fractures, bruising and cuts to her body. She has now left hospital and although she has spoken to her family back in the UK, she may face a wait until she can fly home because her passport was allegedly damaged by the suspect. On Tuesday, Detective Inspector Paul Hart told a news conference: ""It was established they had previously had a relationship but at some point it had soured and he basically deprived her of her liberty and committed a number of offences against her as they travelled around the state. ""What she has experienced is no doubt horrific and terrifying and we commend her for taking the opportunity to speak to our police. ""We have potentially saved this young girl's life. Given what's happened to her, the extent of what's happened over the period of time, anything might have transpired."""

It is understood the bus had been stuck on the railroad for about five or 10 minutes when the train struck - and although officials are unsure why the bus had stopped, engine failure is a possibility. Craig Robinson, who witnessed the crash, told the Sun Herald: ""My first instinct was to get down there and tell people to get off the bus, but by the time I got there the train had already hit it."" Rescuers have been removing trapped passengers through emergency windows, and at least one person has been taken to hospital by air ambulance. The tour bus had been travelling from Austin in Texas when it crashed shortly after 2pm (8pm UK time), and it is thought those on board may have been heading to one of Biloxi's eight casinos.

Following the 16+ ruling he said he was pleased with the ruling which he believed aimed to impose ""new European standards of tolerance so (children) think this is all the norm"". The outrage has been caused by what the film's director, Bill Condon, described as Disney's ""first exclusively gay moment"". In the re-make, the manservant character of LeFou exhibits attraction towards his master, Gaston. Condon told website ScreenCrush: ""LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston.""

In a statement released through the Metropolitan Police, Ms Hydara said: ""I am saddened and shocked by what Khalid has done. I totally condemn his actions. ""I express my condolences to the families of the victims that have died, and wish a speedy recovery to all the injured. ""I would like to request privacy for our family, especially the children, at this difficult time."" Masood, 52, killed four people and injured dozens more in an 82-second rampage last Wednesday. He was shot dead by armed police after fatally stabbing PC Keith Palmer in Parliament's cobbled forecourt. IS claimed Masood as ""a soldier of the Islamic State"" after the attack, but Scotland Yard has said there is ""no evidence"" that he was linked to the extremist group, or al Qaeda. Experts have pointed to the common IS tactic of opportunistically claiming a link to attacks. The Met Police said that, while it had not found evidence linking Masood to the group, he ""clearly"" had an interest in jihad. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national co-ordinator for UK counter-terrorism policing, said: ""His attack method appears to be based on low sophistication, low-tech, low-cost techniques copied from other attacks, and echo the rhetoric of IS leaders in terms of methodology and attacking police and civilians, but at this stage I have no evidence he discussed this with others. ""There is no evidence that Masood was radicalised in prison in 2003, as has been suggested. This is pure speculation at this time."" Mr Basu went on: ""There has been much speculation about who Masood was in contact with immediately prior to the attack. ""All I will say on this point is that Masood's communications that day are a main line of inquiry. ""If you heard from him on March 22, please come forward now, the information you have may prove important to establishing his state of mind. ""I know when, where and how Masood committed his atrocities, but now I need to know why. Most importantly, so do the victims and families."" Sky News revealed last week that Masood used the the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp just before the atrocity. The Facebook-owned company said it is ""co-operating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations"" - but Home Secretary Amber Rudd has refused to rule out legislation on encrypted messaging if authorities believe terrorists are being provided with ""a secret place"" to communicate. On Monday the family of an American tourist who was killed in the attack said they bear no ill-will over the incident. Kurt Cochran, 54, was killed and his 46-year-old wife Melissa was taken to hospital with a broken leg and rib and a cut head. The others who died after Masood drove into pedestrians on Westminster bridge were Aysha Frade, who is believed to have been a 44-year-old married mother-of-two and retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75.

Paracetamol, sun cream, heartburn and indigestion treatments - as well as cough and cold remedies - may also be targeted as part of the review. ""Low-value"" prescription items are estimated to cost NHS England about £128m a year, and the health service argues this money would be better spent on innovative new drugs. Ten medicines are going to be included in the initial review. They include lidocaine plasters, which treat joint and back pain, and Fentinil - a painkiller for cancer patients. Vaccines against hepatitis A, cholera and typhoid are also under scrutiny, as is the triple jab for diphtheria, polio and tetanus. NHS England says it will take the views of patient groups, clinicians and providers into account when it begins a consultation next month. A spokeswoman added: ""The increasing demand for prescriptions for medication that can be bought over the counter at relatively low cost, often for self-limiting or minor conditions, underlines the need for all healthcare professionals to work even closer with patients to ensure the best possible value from NHS resources, whilst eliminating wastage and improving patient outcomes."""

On 26 March 2017, negotiations between them on the establishment of a new devolved government at Stormont ended without agreement. :: Northern Ireland election: A good day for Sinn Fein With no power-sharing administration in place, they face the prospect of an election just three weeks after the last one. So what has changed since the polar-opposite parties surprised the world by reaching towards each other a decade ago? Sinn Fein claims the DUP has grown increasingly arrogant and points to a series of scandals that have rocked devolution. The party's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill, said: ""We want to see the institutions restored but when we said there will be no return to the status quo, we meant it."" But the Democratic Unionists claimed Sinn Fein had entered negotiations ""as if they were the only participants whose mandate mattered"". DUP leader Arlene Foster, the former First Minister of Northern Ireland, said: ""Negotiations will only ever be successful when parties are prepared to be flexible in order to secure outcomes."" There is another factor that should not be underestimated in terms of the relationship between the two largest parties: Brexit. Northern Ireland, like Scotland, voted to remain in the EU. The DUP campaigned to remain, much to Sinn Fein's frustration. The absence of a devolved government leaves Northern Ireland in limbo as the Prime Minister prepares to trigger Article 50. Northern Ireland is the only UK region sharing a land border with another part of the EU: the Irish Republic. :: Martin McGuinness - from guns to government Something else has changed in the last 10 years - the guard. There is a whole new generation of politicians involved. They have less recall of ""the Troubles"" and less ownership of The Good Friday Agreement that helped end the conflict. Ian Paisley has gone, Martin McGuinness has gone. Northern Ireland can only hope the peace process has not gone too."
2017-03-28,Tesco is to take a £235m hit after it agreed separate deals to pay a fine and compensation to shareholders over the 2014 profits scandal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170328104347/http://news.sky.com/story/tesco-to-take-163235m-hit-from-profits-scandal-fines-and-compensation-10816211,"The country's largest supermarket chain said its subsidiary - Tesco Stores - had reached a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) over historic accounting practices with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The deal emerged just days after Sky News reported an announcement was imminent, but it remains subject to judicial scrutiny on 10 April before it could take effect. The SFO stressed that the DPA does not address liability of any sort. Tesco was to pay, it said, a fine of £129m to avoid prosecution in relation to the £326m overstatement of profits in August 2014. At the same time, the City watchdog said it had forced Tesco to compensate investors who had bought shares and bonds on - or after - 29 August and had held the securities when the profit figure was later corrected on 22 September. The compensation bill was estimated by the Financial Conduct Authority at £85m. Tesco said it would book a total charge of £235m - a figure that took not only the fine and compensation into account but also other sums including the SFO's full costs. Its shares opened 0.8% down as investors digested the news - and an entirely different development over major shareholder opposition to the chain's planned £3.7bn takeover of wholesaler, Booker. Commenting on the proposed SFO settlement, Tesco's chief executive Dave Lewis, said: ""Over the last two-and-a-half years, we have fully co-operated with this investigation into historic accounting practices, while at the same time fundamentally transforming our business. ""We sincerely regret the issues which occurred in 2014 and we are committed to doing everything we can to continue to restore trust in our business and brand."" The financial reporting scandal came to light shortly after Mr Lewis joined the company - dominating his time as the chain scrapped to recover sales lost to rivals in the supermarket price war. Three former Tesco executives were charged last autumn with offences including false accounting and fraud by abuse of position, and are due to stand trial next year. Chris Bush, the company's former UK boss; Carl Rogberg, the ex-UK finance director; and John Scouler, former UK commercial director have all indicated they will plead not guilty."

The sentence means he could be released from prison next month, once the time he has already served for his original conviction in November 2013 is taken into account. There were huge cheers from the Royal Marine's supporters in the public gallery as the sentence was delivered. Announcing the sentence, the panel of judges, led by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, said: ""As with any person sentenced to a determinate term, his release will ordinarily be at the halfway point of the sentence."" Blackman has already served almost three-and-a-half years in prison after originally being sentenced to life with a minimum term of 10 years by a court martial, a sentence which was reduced to eight years on appeal. His legal team say he could be released from jail in around two weeks, with the exact date still to be determined by the Prison Service. Speaking after the sentencing, Blackman's wife Claire said: ""We are overjoyed at the judges' decision to significantly reduce Al's sentence such that he can be released imminently. ""This is the moment we have all be fighting hard for. It is hard to believe that this day is finally here."" Earlier this month, judges at the Court Martial Appeal Court decided the shooting, which took place in Helmand province in 2011, was the result of a mental illness. The shooting was captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of another Royal Marine, who went with Blackman to find the Taliban fighter who had been wounded by an Apache helicopter. In his original court martial, Blackman claimed he had thought the man was already dead, but in the video the body visibly twitches after the shot. During sentencing the judges said that ""this was a deliberate killing of a wounded man"" and that Blackman ""still retained a substantial responsibility"" for the death. Despite this they said Blackman had been ""an exemplary soldier before his deployment to Afghanistan in March 2011"". They said he ""suffered from quite exceptional stressors"" during that deployment and that his ability ""to form a rational judgement"" was ""substantially impaired"". Oliver Lee, Blackman's former commanding officer in September 2011 and a former colonel of the Royal Marines, said he was ""very pleased that Sergeant Blackman has now been dealt with justly and fairly.""

""Linda wants to get it across she's not dying of cancer. She's living with cancer. They've said it is treatable, she could have years. We have to focus on that,"" said Coleen. Linda Nolan had already been treated for breast cancer in 2006 and was considered free of the disease. ""She actually broke her hip. She went to hospital and while they did the scan of her hip, they found secondary cancer. It was earth-shattering for us initially,"" Coleen Nolan revealed on ITV's Loose Women.

2017-03-28,Calls for security agencies to have access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp were raised again after the Westminster attack. Here are the questions surrounding the apps:,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170328104347/http://news.sky.com/story/messaging-apps-and-terror-seven-key-questions-10815589,"1. What is encryption? Encryption means sending information in a way that only authorised people can access it. In practice, this means the original message is scrambled using an algorithm. This creates a new message, or cyphertext, which should look like nonsense to anyone spying in. Only people with the correct decryption keys can unlock the message back into its original meaning. There are different ways to encrypt messages, and many different services, but it is fundamentally based on mathematics. 2. How does it work? Most end-to-end encrypted services rely on a public/private key encryption. Each person has two keys. The private key is yours alone, and used to decrypt messages that are sent to you. For services like iMessage and WhatsApp, this is kept on your device and done automatically. Your public key is available to anyone - it is used to encrypt messages in a way that can only be decrypted by you, with your private key. The public key is a bit like a pickup delivery locker. Anyone can put a package in for you, but only you can unlock it. 3. Which services are encrypted? Pretty much the entire digital world runs on encryption. Any message can be encrypted - and the way the internet works is by swapping messages. Encryption keeps you bank details safe when you shop online or in the real world, when you take money out of a cash machine. Every time you make a mobile phone call, it's (to some extent) encrypted. The current row focuses on messaging apps, though. Services like WhatsApp and iMessage serve more than a billion users and offer encryption. Then there is a host of other, lesser known apps, including Signal and Telegram, that offer secure private messaging. 4. Can the company (ie WhatsApp, Apple) see encrypted messages on their platforms? End-to-end encryption should mean only you and the person you are speaking with can see the message - so Apple and Whatsapp will not see it. However, if you are backing up your messages to the cloud - an option in settings - they keep this data unencrypted, and could hand it over to governments if legally obliged. 5. Can the security agencies see them? In theory, if a message is properly encrypted end-to-end, only the sender and receiver can see it. However, it is possible that a service might not be properly configured, allowing others to exploit weaknesses in the system. And there are other ways around it, including what the security services call equipment interference and what we call hacking. If someone has remote control of a user's device, they can see everything on it - including decrypted messages sitting on the phone. MI5 has said it has ""relied"" on equipment interference in the ""the overwhelming majority of high priority investigations"". 6. Would restricting encryption have stopped the Westminster attack? The Westminster attacker was using WhatsApp, but having access to his messages would not have prevented the attack - because he was not under surveillance or the subject of a warrant. Therefore GCHQ and MI5 would not have read his messages, even if they had been able to do so. 7. What is the concern about allowing official access in terrorist cases? Although Home Secretary Amber Rudd's proposal remains unclear, it seems she is suggesting a back door into these services. This sounds like the Government wants access, in special circumstances, to the private key of users. The problem is that as soon as there is a copy of a key, someone else could steal that copy. That could be a foreign government, like Russia or China, or online criminals. Nor would this necessarily prevent attacks. And if, say, WhatsApp did create a backdoor for government, there are plenty of other encrypted messaging services those determined to evade the law could use. Again, encryption relies on maths which is well understood and public knowledge. Forcing companies to create back doors would make millions of people less safe online. That may be trade off we are willing to make, but it is a choice the Government should lay out clearly."
2017-03-28,UK authorities are facing an increased terror threat from battle-hardened fighters returning from Mosul and other conflict zones in Iraq and Syria.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170328104347/http://news.sky.com/story/battle-hardened-returning-jihadists-pose-uk-terror-threat-10815737,"Security sources have told Sky News more than 400 former fighters are now believed to be back in Britain. The authorities believe there is a growing risk the UK could suffer the kind of mass gun and bomb attacks seen in France and Belgium recently, as many returning fighters will have been trained in the use of weapons and the construction of improvised explosive devices. It is a serious, two-pronged challenge for the police and security services, who are already working flat-out to counter the threat from homegrown lone-wolf extremists, like Khalid Masood, who launched last week's deadly attack on Westminster. :: The battle for Mosul: A timeline Former Scotland Yard Specialist Firearms Officer and author Tony Long said combating an attack launched by a well-trained returning jihadist could be a tough prospect. He said: ""These are combat-hardened soldiers. They might not be trained in the way that NATO might train their soldiers but they've seen more close quarter conflict and more urban fighting than probably most members of the British Armed Forces and you have to respect that. ""Of course they're bringing that knowledge back with them to the UK and it's very very difficult because of the legal restrictions that are put on the security services and the police to actually monitor all of these people."" To date, only a fraction of those returning from the battlefields of Syria and Iraq have been prosecuted, as authorities need enough evidence to put before the courts and often returning fighters go to great lengths to cover up their overseas activities. Imran Khawaja, 29, from west London, is currently serving 12 years in prison after he faked his own death in Syria in an attempt to sneak back into the UK undetected. Khawaja had joined a militant group with links to so-called Islamic State while overseas. He was pictured posing with the severed heads of Syrian soldiers during his six months in the country. He was arrested as he tried to re-enter the UK through the port of Dover and later admitted preparing for acts of terrorism, attending a camp, receiving training and possessing firearms. Security sources said they could not be certain that Khawaja would have launched an attack back home, but the pattern of returning jihadists posing a major risk to national security is well established. More than a decade ago, groups of al Qaeda trained terrorists were responsible for mass carnage in Europe and the United States. Those who launched the devastating attack on the London transport system on 7 July 2005 had attended al Qaeda training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some of the terrorists who launched a similar failed attack on London on 21 July 2005 had received weapons and explosives training, as had some of the plotters who planned to blow up airliners with liquid bombs in 2006. :: Traumatised children of Mosul Security expert Professor Tahir Abbas from the Royal United Services Institute said: ""The police and security services are certainly preparing for all eventualities, because in Britain, we've had our lessons from the past. ""These returning fighters pose a number of threats in relation to security here. ""They've been through a lot of very traumatic conflict and engagement, often involved in street-to-street fighting. ""Now, having made their way back to Britain, they pose a particular threat because of their capacity - and perhaps they've been instructed to return, hold fire and wait for the go ahead to launch attacks. ""They are likely to be traumatised, but also extremely experienced and well trained individuals who pose a serious risk."" With the growing threat from returning fighters, emergency services have been increasing their training to respond to gun and bomb attacks. On March 19, more than 200 police officers carried out a training exercise on the River Thames, where police firearms teams boarded a boat in a training scenario involving dozens of hostages. The UK government has provided millions of pounds in extra funding to help Chief Constables across country to increase their firearms capability to respond to a terrorist attack."

The organisation polled more than 300 women aged under 25 with youngsters and found that two-thirds said they were only just managing financially. The trust found there were a series of barriers that contribute to the strains on family budgets. Most young mums said it would be easier to find work if they had access to cheaper childcare, jobs with flexible hours, part-time work and an employer sympathetic to pregnant women or mothers. Young Women's Trust chief executive Carole Easton said the women they spoke to were clearly committed to their children's upbringing, but often faced ""huge challenges"". Many, she said, suffered discrimination, isolation and financial difficulties. ""A shocking number are having to skip meals or turn to food banks in order to feed their children,"" she said. ""Young mums are telling us they want to work and become financially independent but they face huge barriers like discrimination from employers, a lack of available and affordable childcare, a lack of flexible working opportunities and inconsistent support from Jobcentre Plus. ""On top of that, they are entitled to less government support and lower wages because of their age."" The Trust said what was required was access to affordable childcare, better support for young women at job centres and more jobs on a flexible, part-time or job share basis. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""Encouragingly, the number of children living in working households is now at a record high but we want to go further. ""This is why we're taking steps like increasing the number of work coaches and doubling free childcare for three and four-year-olds. ""Every day our dedicated work coaches help thousands of people across the country, including young mothers, to get into work or access the support that they need."""

Its proposal, worth a total of 814 pence per Bovis share, was made up of cash, new Redrow shares and a dividend payment. But it was later trumped by an all-share merger offer from another rival, Galliford Try, which valued Bovis at 886p-per share. The statement said: ""The Board of Redrow has determined that it is not in its shareholders' best interests to increase its proposal to Bovis above the level which was rejected by the board of Bovis. ""Given this, Redrow confirms that it does not intend to make an offer for Bovis."" Redrow shares were 1.4% up in early trading on the FTSE 250. While Bovis also rejected Galliford Try's opening salvo, the pair have continued talks. A tie-up between Galliford and Bovis would see the country's 6th and 8th-biggest housebuilders by home completions combine at a time when Bovis is attempting to overcome a series of challenges. Its chief executive David Ritchie left the business after the company issued a profit warning in December linked to poor customer satisfaction. Bovis announced last month that it would be slowing the pace of building in 2017 after taking a £7m hit related to complaints about unfinished properties, including electrical and plumbing faults."

The incident sparked a social media storm after another passenger at Denver International Airport, Shannon Watts, tweeted about what happened. She said the girls' father was wearing shorts at the time and was allowed to board the flight. Ms Watts, the founder of anti-gun violence group Moms Demand Action, tweeted: ""This behaviour is sexist and sexualizes young girls."" 1) A @united gate agent isn't letting girls in leggings get on flight from Denver to Minneapolis because spandex is not allowed? 2) This behavior is sexist and sexualizes young girls. Not to mention that the families were mortified and inconveninced. The airline defended the action, explaining the girls were travelling under an employee travel pass that includes a dress code. The dress code bars pass travellers from wearing spandex or Lycra pants, including leggings. @united @shannonrwatts if leggings aren't allowed then what about shorts & dresses. Sounds like united Airlines is body shaming United Airlines spokesman Jonathan Guerin said the company was standing by its decision because the teenagers were essentially representing the company. ""We would ask the same of pass riders who were wearing flip-flops or who were wearing clothing that revealed their undergarments or torn, tattered jeans,"" he said. He added they would not have been turned away if they were paying customers. But many Twitter users condemned the action, with one saying: ""If leggings aren't allowed then what about shorts & dresses. Sounds like United Airlines is body shaming."" Hey @united I fly a LOT.

New barriers are being used to secure the route of the procession in addition to existing road closures. They are being put up in time for the next Changing of the Guard on Wednesday. Tourists flock to see the famous event, which sees soldiers in their red tunics marching through the streets accompanied by a brass band to take over guard duties at the castle. Assistant Chief Constable Dave Hardcastle said ""recent events in Westminster clearly highlight the need for extra security measures to be introduced"". ""The force believes that it is proportionate and necessary to put in place extra security measures to further protect and support the public and the guard change,"" he said. ""This is consistent with security deployments in London. ""Preventative measures such as these have been put in place across the UK over the past 10 years at various events."" In December, after the Berlin market attack, the Metropolitan Police decided to boost security around the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace. Roads were closed and extra barriers put in place to protect the guards. The ceremony also changed its schedule to take place on set days rather than every alternate day."

Nine people have been released without charge, while a 32-year-old woman from Manchester has been released on bail. A 58-year-old man, arrested in Birmingham, remains in police custody after a total of 15 raids across the UK. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has criticised messaging services like WhatsApp for potentially allowing terrorists to communicate undetected. She called for encrypted networks to build ""back doors"" into their system so terrorists' messages can be accessed during investigations. It came after it emerged that Masood sent an encrypted message via WhatsApp just minutes before his murderous assault. :: Amber Rudd warns tech firms face 'ticking off' over terrorism Speaking to Sophy Ridge On Sunday, Ms Rudd also insisted social media companies must do more to deal with extremist material as part of the drive to combat terrorism. She is due to meet with internet giants Google, Twitter, and Facebook later this week to discuss the issue, and warned: ""They're going to get a lot more than a ticking off."" :: Westminster attack was over in just 82 seconds In response WhatsApp said it had been assisting the police investigation. A spokeswoman said: ""We are horrified at the attack carried out in London earlier this week and are co-operating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations.""

""And encryption is a really really important part of that."" :: Messaging apps and terror: Seven key questions Mr Dorsey was speaking to Sky News as Square, a mobile payments company, launched in the UK. Square lets small businesses accept credit and debit cards; its systems use encryption to keep customers' and businesses' financial information safe. After the Westminster attack, Home Secretary Amber Rudd called on companies like WhatsApp to give government access to their encrypted services. On Monday, a spokesperson for Downing Street repeated Ms Rudd's calls: ""What the Home secretary said yesterday is, where there are instances where law enforcement agencies wish to gain access to messages which are important to an investigation, they should be able to do so."" The Home Secretary has also said internet companies need to do more to remove extremist content from their platforms. On Thursday she will summon technology bosses from Twitter, Facebook and Google for discussions. Mr Dorsey defended Twitter. ""I think we've definitely led the industry in that,"" he told Sky News. ""But there's always more work to do. And the question is, how do you do this at massive scale? And that's where using more technologies like machine learning can really help. ""But I think Twitter has a pretty great record in this regard. ""But we're always looking to make sure we have the right partnership with the Government to understand what the needs are and to really push."" In its latest transparency report, Twitter said it had removed nearly 377,000 accounts promoting terrorism in the second half of 2016. Mr Dorsey told Sky News that machine learning could also help curb abuse on the social network, and said it was trying to do more to protect users. ""We can certainly give more controls to people, to make sure that the right things are being amplified. And we're giving people controls to report any sort of targeted harassment or abuse."" Mr Dorsey founded Square in May 2010, four years after co-founding Twitter. On the decision to launch in the UK, he told Sky News: ""The UK has always been a phenomenal market. It's full of entrepreneurs - over five million small businesses - and I think less than half accept credit cards. ""It's really making sure that we were ready for this market. ""A lot of what we have to do is work with banks, work with regulators, make sure that as we bring on more merchants, they trust that we're doing that in the right way. ""We wanted to make sure that we got everything right and understood the model in the US, and then look for the next biggest markets going down the line."""

The avalanche came down the hill at around 8.30am Monday local time. Thirty-eight of the group were injured and two remain in a critical condition in hospital, authorities said. One of the students told public broadcaster NHK that he had felt a strong wind and seen a white mass heading towards him. An instructor told him to get down before everyone was engulfed, he said. The group had been taking part in a three-day training scheme for members of school mountaineering clubs. Heavy snow had fallen overnight, resulting in the cancellation of a planned climbing expedition. Instead, the students had been practising moving through heavy snow. An avalanche warning had been in place for the area. A local government official said there would be an investigation into why the group had been on the slopes at the time of the alert. ""We have avalanche incidents once or twice a year around here, but haven't had anything this big,"" a fire department official said."

The head of the university's school of medicine, dentistry and nursing, Professor Matthew Walters, said it was ""disappointing"" to have discovered the collusion.

The LSE had previously warned the tie-up was all but dead in the water because it would not meet a requirement that it sell a 60% stake in a bond trading platform called MTS. It described that regulatory demand as ""disproportionate"". A deal would have created a trading powerhouse - headquartered in London - to rival the biggest US operators and it remained on track through last summer despite doubts raised by the UK's Brexit vote. The European Commission ruled against it on competition grounds, saying it would have created a ""de facto monopoly"" in Europe. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, said: ""The European economy depends on well-functioning financial markets. ""That is not just important for banks and other financial institutions. The whole economy benefits when businesses can raise money on competitive financial markets. ""The merger between Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange would have significantly reduced competition by creating a de facto monopoly in the crucial area of clearing of fixed income instruments. ""As the parties failed to offer the remedies required to address our competition concerns, the Commission has decided to prohibit the merger."" The LSE Group, which had already sold off its French clearing business LCH to help satisfy Commission concerns, responded: ""LSEG believes the proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse in combination with the LCH remedy would have preserved credible and robust competition in all markets. ""This was an opportunity to create a world-leading market infrastructure group anchored in Europe, which would have supported Europe's 23 million SMEs and the development of a deeper Capital Markets Union."" LSE said it was ""confident in its prospects as a standalone business"" and would move to enhance the value of its stock through a £200m share buyback. Its shares were 3.8% up in the wake of the announcement. The ruling marked the third failed attempt at a merger between the pair in 17 years and it could be seen as an opportunity for Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, to renew its interest in LSE. John Colley, a Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, said: ""Whilst the business is performing well at the moment there is very likely to be some fallout from Brexit. ""A weakened LSE may need to look west for a future partner and strategy. ""There is likely to be plenty of interest from that quarter where Chicago's ICE has grown rapidly in recent years through acquisition. ""Dollar strength against Sterling and low costs of borrowing suggest that ICE will come calling very quickly."" Deutsche Boerse chairman Joachim Faber described the ruling as a ""setback for Europe, the Capital Markets Union and the bridge between continental Europe and Great Britain."""

2017-03-29,A former Royal Marine who shot and killed an injured Taliban fighter in Afghanistan could be released from prison in two weeks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170329141005/http://news.sky.com/story/marine-a-alexander-blackman-could-be-out-of-jail-within-weeks-10816338,"Alexander Blackman, 42, has been sentenced to seven years in prison for diminished responsibility manslaughter after his murder conviction was overturned. The sentence means he could be released from prison next month, once the time he has already served for his original conviction in November 2013 is taken into account. There were huge cheers from Blackman's supporters in the public gallery as the sentence was delivered. Announcing the sentence, the panel of judges, led by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, said: ""As with any person sentenced to a determinate term, his release will ordinarily be at the halfway point of the sentence."" Blackman has already served almost three-and-a-half years in prison after originally being sentenced to life with a minimum term of 10 years by a court martial, a sentence which was reduced to eight years on appeal. His legal team say he could be released from jail in around two weeks, with the exact date still to be determined by the Prison Service. Speaking after the sentencing, Blackman's wife Claire said: ""We are overjoyed at the judges' decision to significantly reduce Al's sentence such that he can be released imminently. ""This is the moment we have all be fighting hard for. It is hard to believe that this day is finally here."" Earlier this month, judges at the Court Martial Appeal Court decided the shooting, which took place in Helmand province in 2011, was the result of a mental illness. The shooting was captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of another Royal Marine, who went with Blackman to find the Taliban fighter who had been wounded by an Apache helicopter. In his original court martial, Blackman claimed he had thought the man was already dead, but in the video the body visibly twitches after the shot. During sentencing the judges said that ""this was a deliberate killing of a wounded man"" and that Blackman ""still retained a substantial responsibility"" for the death. Despite this they said Blackman had been ""an exemplary soldier before his deployment to Afghanistan in March 2011"". They said he ""suffered from quite exceptional stressors"" during that deployment and that his ability ""to form a rational judgement"" was ""substantially impaired"". Oliver Lee, Blackman's former commanding officer in September 2011 and a former colonel of the Royal Marines, said he was ""very pleased that Sergeant Blackman has now been dealt with justly and fairly"". ""My hope now is that the many lessons from this tragic case will be learned and the Royal Marines can look forward to another 350 years of highly distinguished service,"" he said."

Ms Sturgeon's minority Government won the vote with help from the Scottish Greens. After the vote, Ms Sturgeon said the referendum would be ""first and foremost, about giving the people of Scotland a choice on this country's future"". She faces an uphill battle, however, as Prime Minister Theresa May has already promised to block another referendum during the Brexit negotiations. A UK Government spokeswoman echoed this, saying they would ""not be entering into negotiations on the Scottish Government's proposal"". She added: ""At this point, all our focus should be on our negotiations with the European Union, making sure we get the right deal for the whole of the UK. ""It would be unfair to the people of Scotland to ask them to make a crucial decision without the necessary information about our future relationship with Europe, or what an independent Scotland would look like."" But Ms Sturgeon said the MSPs' vote ""must now be respected"". She added: ""The mandate for a referendum is beyond question and it would be democratically indefensible - and utterly unsustainable - to attempt to stand in the way of it."" :: Scotland's path to a second independence referendum Sky's Scotland Correspondent James Matthews said there were cheers from inside Holyrood and from a small crowd of independence supporters stationed outside the building as the result of the vote was announced. He added: ""The problem for Nicola Sturgeon is that (independence supporters) don't number more than 50% of the Scottish population, according to the opinion polls. ""There is still a firm majority in favour of sustaining or retaining the union and that is her challenge now - to turn over that deficit in public support."" :: Second Scottish independence referendum: What are the arguments for and against? Ms Sturgeon will now write a letter to Mrs May ""later this week"" with her Section 30 request, a delay that Matthews said was likely due to ""politics and PR"". ""I think in terms of PR in political campaigning, that letter would have been lost in the coverage and fuss surrounding the triggering of Article 50."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the decision to go ahead with another vote was ""deeply regrettable"", while Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said there was no evidence that Scots want another referendum. She said: ""We have no idea what Brexit looks like, or how it will impact our economy and families in Scotland."" Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens' external affairs spokesman, said: ""It should be our responsibility, as those elected by the people of Scotland, to fight for their right to choose their own future."""
2017-03-29,The latest smartphone from Samsung is expected to be unveiled later today.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170329141005/http://news.sky.com/story/samsung-to-release-new-phone-after-note-7-woes-10817165,"The firm will launch the Galaxy S8 at events in New York and London, according to reports. Industry insiders say it will come in two sizes and will feature a larger screen. Samsung will be hoping the S8 performs well after the company was forced to withdraw the Note 7 because of battery problems. Note 7s were made subject to a global recall in October after the phones were found to set themselves alight. The Note 7 issues are said to have cost Samsung more than £3bn. The firm will sell refurbished versions of the Note 7 with a new battery in South Korea, the country's Electronic Times reported on Tuesday. Environmental groups have also criticised the company over what it planned to do with the more than four million unused devices. Samsung has also faced accusations in 2017 that it provided illegal financial support in connection with an abuse-of-power scandal that led to the arrest for bribery of the group's heir apparent and the ousting of South Korea's president. Industry analysts say the launch of the S8 will provide Samsung with a chance to rebuild its reputation. Samsung boss DJ Koh said at the time the Note 7's problems were discovered that he ""deeply apologised"" to Samsung customers. He also said the internal investigation, which also led to the creation of new stringent safety tests for the company's phones, was the ""first step to regain your (customer) trust"". Last week, the tech giant also unveiled its new artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistant, Bixby. The gizmo aims to be a rival to Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple's Siri."
2017-03-29,"Across the country, emotions ran high during the EU referendum campaign - but there is little sign of Bregret from voters as Theresa May triggers the start of Brexit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170329141005/http://news.sky.com/story/sky-data-brexit-poll-half-of-britons-happy-about-talks-starting-10816972,"A Sky Data poll found one in two people were happy or very happy about the triggering of Article 50, while only 36% said they felt sad about leaving the EU. That suggests that there has been little voter remorse for the referendum decision last June to quit the EU, when 52% of the population voted to leave while 48% voted to remain. Sky News travelled to the East of England to take the Brexit temperature in one of the most eurosceptic parts of the UK. Like many parts of the country, city dwellers were at odds with those living in neighbouring towns and villages. University city Norwich was the only place in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex that voted remain, with 56% of local residents opting to stay in the EU. Locals in Norwich told Sky News they were feeling ambivalent and sad about Theresa May pulling the trigger on Brexit. As one market stall worker said: ""I don't feel right about it. When unions break apart, it never ends well."" Leave the city centre and the surrounding towns and villages tell a very different story. Just 20 miles away in Great Yarmouth, nearly three in four adults voted to quit the EU - making this seaside town the fifth strongest Vote Leave area in the UK. Locals on the seaside promenade told Sky News they were happy with the result: they hope Brexit might bring some benefits for their seaside town ravaged by decades of neglect. One local man, Carl, said he had voted to leave the EU and hoped Brexit might mean more attention; that Government funding might flow into the town where he was born and bred. He said: ""People have had enough. Hopefully it'll mean we can concentrate on the UK."" Great Yarmouth, like many other coastal towns, suffers from high rates of teenage pregnancy, social deprivation, low educational attainment and higher than average levels of unemployment. Support for the UKIP has surged in Great Yarmouth, with the anti-EU party picking up four councils seats in last year's local council election - making it the second biggest party in local government behind the Tories, with 12 councillors. A desire for change in a town with little to lose, Sky Data suggests voters up and down the country are braced for some sort of economic hit from Brexit - but are also undeterred. In a Sky poll, 42% of respondents said they thought Brexit would be bad for the economy, while 36% thought leaving the EU will benefit the economy. The rest didn't know. Chris Hanretty, lecturer in politics at the University of East Anglia, told Sky News there was little reason for people to feel Bregret at this stage of the process. ""There hasn't been much evidence at all of Bregret or remorse or people changing their minds, just because, well, they haven't seen much change - so far."""

The victim was taken to a local hospital but could not be revived and was pronounced dead a short time after midnight. A post-mortem examination found he died from hypovolemic, or hemorrhagic, shock, resulting from catastrophic loss of blood or other fluids and damage to the airway consistent with a dog bite. Officers say his family have been informed and his death is not being treated as suspicious.

A spokeswoman for the group told Sky News that at least one arrest was made and the flight was suspended as a result of the protest. A spokesman for Stansted, a major airport just north of London, said the protest had been restricted to a remote part of the site but flights were being suspended for safety reasons. He said it did not take place beside the passenger terminal. The spokesman confirmed to Sky News that the protest targeted a ""private charter"" flight. He said: ""The runway was closed while Essex Police contained the situation. The protesters were on a remote stand, not on the passenger side.

2017-03-29,To misquote Monty Python's lesson in haggling: €60bn for that? You must be mad.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170329141005/http://news.sky.com/story/will-we-really-have-to-pay-eu-836460bn-for-brexit-10800659,"The EU wants to make sure that the UK doesn't walk away without paying its dues. Equally, the Prime Minister cannot be seen to be giving huge sums of cash to Brussels to get out of the Brexit door. While the art of negotiation may play out in a more sophisticated way than it does between the beard-seller and Brian in the Python's Life of Brian - it may not. Here's what's at stake. :: There's a Brexit bill? Yes the EU has indicated there will be an exit bill. From the European perspective, the UK will have to settle the bar tab before leaving the pub. It's ordered a bunch of rounds already and promised to buy its friends a whole bunch more. Basically the UK has to pay up for spending promised in the past and spending promised into the future. Although there are those in the UK government who have suggested it's more like being a member of a gym. When you leave you aren't asked to continue paying your fees so others can enjoy its benefits without you. :: So how much does the EU say we owe? It's been described (by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker) as ""hefty"" and put at somewhere between €40bn (£35bn) and €60bn (£51bn). The €60bn is most frequently quoted because this is the sum the European Commission has arrived at. But lawyers have told the UK Government it does not owe a penny and should actually be asking for money back. :: €60bn! How did they work that out? Crudely speaking it's: the UK share of EU liabilities - UK share of EU assets = Brexit bill. It has not set out its calculations. However, Financial Times journalist Alex Barker has looked at how the €60bn bill is calculated in a comprehensive paper for the Centre for European Reform. :: OK so what are the assets? Stuff like property and equipment including the Berlaymont Building, which houses the European Commission, in Brussels and Europe House in Smith Square in London - the former headquarters of the Conservative Party. These have been put at around €152bn. :: And the liabilities? The EU spends on projects to even things out and make the bloc of 28 more competitive as a whole - raising living standards in countries that are lagging behind. It means poorer countries get more of the cash than richer countries - and richer countries pay more than poorer ones. (Yes this has always caused some friction). There are other EU-wide projects such as the Galileo satellite navigation system, which is supposed to be fully operational by 2019. Then there's the €63.8bn pensions liability to pay the very generous pensions of EU officials. :: But will we really pay €60bn? The former ambassador the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has warned European leaders will play ""hardball"" and there will be fist fights over ""British dosh"". Alarm bells are ringing in Brussels over the €10bn a year blackhole in EU finances left by the UK's departure. The richer countries don't want to pay more and the poorer countries don't want to receive less. But the UK will push back on quite such a high sum. For a start, it's not going to go down well with the public who are expecting to see £350m a week from the EU pouring back into UK coffers for the NHS. Senior government sources told The Sunday Times that Theresa May will call on the EU to hand back £9bn of UK assets held by the European Investment Bank, when she triggers Brexit. Legal advice by leading Conservative barrister, Martin Howe, passed to the Brexit Department says the UK is not obliged to pay a thing to Brussels to get out of the exit door, according to the newspaper. The scrap will be bloody. :: Can't we just not pay it? It is pretty roundly agreed that the Brexit bill is the cost of a free trade deal with the EU. The man leading the EU negotiations, Michel Barnier, has made it clear settling the Brexit bill is top of his hit list. He wants a deal sorted on this by December. No bill payment deal, no trade deal talks. The UK has made it pretty clear it is not going to agree a Brexit bill without securing trade deal terms. According to Sir Ivan, it's all going to come to a head at a ""gory"" meeting in the autumn of 2018. Legal advice to the Government is that Britain can leave without paying a penny but according to a leaked copy of EU negotiating strategy, if Britain doesn't pay the bloc will take it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. :: And if we pay it will that be the end of payments to Brussels? Yes… and no. The European Commission is offering a payment plan, which will mean instalments, to settle the bill and Mrs May has promised an end to ""vast contributions"" to the EU. However, Brexit Secretary David Davis has said the UK could continue paying for some joint schemes that the Government still wants a part in - or access to. :: So when are we getting the £350m a week back for the NHS? Ah that… No time soon. Yes it was written on a bus, yes it has been credited with winning the Leave campaign but it's now pretty much universally agreed it's just not going to happen. The backslide on it began during campaigning when Vote Leavers like Boris Johnson said it would be more like £100,000. Now he's saying large sums of money will no longer be paid to the UK and can be used for things ""such as"" the NHS. What goes on campaign, stays on campaign."

On the so-called ""divorce bill"" reported on by Sky News at the December EU summit, the Prime Minister has ruled out large yearly payments, but that still allows for a one-off settlement of net liabilities.

His instructions will allow regulators to rewrite key rules curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing and scrap a requirement for federal officials to consider the impact of climate change when making decisions. Central to the changes is a review of Mr Obama's clean power plan - a pledge to cut US emissions by 26-28% by 2025 - which paved the way for the Paris agreement on tackling climate change to be agreed by 195 countries. A senior Trump administration official told the AFP news agency that the prospect of withdrawal from the Paris agreement was ""still under discussion"". The White House said the measures will ""help keep energy and electricity affordable, reliable, and clean in order to boost economic growth and job creation"". The President has already vowed to slash EPA funding by a third and appointed Scott Pruitt - who previously sued the agency - as its head. His pick of former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State has also caused concern among environmental campaigners. But Mr Trump's climate scepticism and promises to bring back coal mining jobs to states like Kentucky and West Virginia appeared to strike a chord with Republican supporters on the campaign trail. Around 68% of Americans believe climate change is caused by humans, but just 40% of Republicans say they worry about it, according to a Gallup poll. Some experts have warned the economic benefit from ditching the clean power plan will be limited, while efforts to undo environmental laws are likely to be challenged in the courts. ""In my view, it will have virtually no impact,"" said professor James Van Nostrand of West Virginia University, who said the decline of coal had more to do with higher mining costs and cheaper natural gas and renewables. ""Defunding or dismantling the EPA and repealing its regulations is not going to bring the coal industry back."" The United States is the world's second largest polluter. Around 37% of domestic carbon dioxide emissions come from electricity generation. Mr Trump has issued a series of executive orders since entering the Oval Office in January. He would claim success for pulling the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership international trade agreement - which he saw as a ""bad deal"" for the country. But his most controversial order - a travel ban on Muslim-majority countries - has twice been blocked by legal challenges."

For four decades, Britain's social and economic foundations have become more and more tightly integrated with the rest of Europe. More than one in ten of all the laws passed in recent decades came from Europe. Now that process will abruptly go into reverse. The economic implications of this process are incredibly far-reaching: now that Britain can forge its own way, will it transform its economic model? Will the process of leaving the EU damage the economy? Will all those predictions about a weaker economy and poorer household incomes come true? :: Half of Britons happy Brexit talks starting Tempting as it is to assume that once Article 50 is out of the way, we will finally get answers to these questions, I wouldn't be so sure. In fact, the chances are the next few months will look rather similar to the last ones: we will still see lots of political noise as both the UK and the EU lay out their negotiating positions. It will be hard, for some time, to get a sense of where things will end up (that is what happens with negotiations). :: Tick-tock: It's the Sky Brexit Countdown And, in the absence of a sudden change of tack from either side, markets are likely to carry on what they've been doing since the dust cleared after the referendum: to tick over, until more clarity emerges about the eventual deal Britain will get. Indeed, the parameters of the negotiations have been clear for some time: before any talks about the trade deal Britain could secure with Europe, some other things will have to be cleared up. :: Brexit timetable: Guide to the next two years Among these are: the divorce proceedings themselves; the question of a cash settlement between the UK and Europe; and the question of what happens to EU assets and, crucially, to EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU. There are big question marks over the land border in Northern Ireland. So, for all the excitement over the Article 50 letter itself, the fundamentals are unlikely to shift in the coming days. :: Twenty big Brexit questions answered Instead we will hear a lot about process. We will hear about how the EU intends to respond, about how open they plan to be about their negotiating position, about the business to be discussed in the next summit in late April. There will be some discussion over whether the UK can start discussions about future ties while also negotiating the divorce (Britain wants to, the EU is apparently reluctant). :: Disunited Kingdom: Has Brexit divided the UK? Such things are incredibly exciting to policy wonks but of less significance to normal human beings. For most of us, what matters is that the economy has not fallen off a cliff in the wake of the Brexit vote, and is unlikely to fall off another one this week. However, it is worth noting that the relatively robust economic growth has started to tail off in recent months. Britain evaded a recession, but much of the consumer spending that fuelled growth in the second half of last year seems to be tailing off. :: Article 50 letter will set mood for negotiations Business investment is weak (as companies tread water to a degree as they try to work out the impact of Brexit). Inflation is rising and wage inflation is staying put. Probably, real wages are already falling. In other words, the economic backdrop is likely to look a lot less rosy over the coming year or so. Not a crisis, but not the feelgood factor. :: Brexit talks: How team UK and team EU line up That is somewhat inevitable. Until businesses and households have more sense of the eventual destination, they are quite rational to cut back on spending. The bad news is that Article 50 and the Great Repeal Bill, which has its White Paper tabled tomorrow, are likely to leave the big questions unanswered. We will need to be more patient. You can't wind up a 40-year relationship overnight."

As Theresa May prepared to trigger Article 50, the Government was urged to help secure a deal on trade that would help preserve the ""life-blood"" of Britain's future economic success. Separately, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published figures outlining the central importance of the trade in goods with the continent. CEEMET urged a pragmatic approach from both sides saying it was not in the interest of either the UK or EU to see a ""cliff-edge"" outcome damaging investment opportunities and business confidence. It called for a ""stable and orderly exit, preserving as much as possible the often complex and delicate trading relationships that are in place"". Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, said: ""These negotiations are likely to be amongst the toughest and most critical the UK has ever been involved in. ""It is imperative that the Government is focussed on securing a deal that will enable both British and European businesses to flourish, investment and innovation to continue and trade to flow. ""This will be the lifeblood that is key to the UK's future economic success - we cannot afford to see it disrupted or turned off in mid flow. ""Forget all notion of crashing out of the EU without a deal and leaving business to pick up the pieces - focus instead on an orderly and smooth transition."" Figures from the ONS showed that 47% of UK goods exports went to the EU while just 7% from the rest of the EU came to the UK, in 2015. In that year, the UK was the tenth largest exporter of goods in the world, with sales of £288bn. Goods accounted for 55% of UK exports in 2016, outweighing sales of services despite the dominance of the latter in the domestic British economy. The intervention from the manufacturing sector is the latest plea from business groups on Brexit. Sky News revealed on Tuesday that the CBI is writing to hundreds of MPs calling for ""an ambitious agreement with the EU that ensures we avoid new barriers to trade and a smooth process without a cliff edge"". Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is calling for ""answers to practical questions, not political posturing"" over Brexit. BCC director-general Adam Marshall said: ""A pragmatic and grown-up dialogue on the real-world issues, rather than verbal volleys between London and Brussels, would give firms greater confidence over the next two years."" Reports by two separate Lords committees have outlined the importance of seeking a free trade agreement both for the goods trade and non-financial services from fashion to aviation. Elsewhere there are fears of an exodus of thousands of jobs from the City if as feared financial firms lose ""passporting"" rights enabling them to sell their services freely across the continent."

Mr Mackey revealed police had up to 3,500 witnesses to the attack, which began on the south side of Westminster Bridge and lasted 82 seconds, before Masood was shot dead by an armed police officer. :: Messaging apps and terror: Seven key questions He told the committee a ""truly enormous"" volume of digital information is being examined as part of the investigation. Mr Mackey added: ""It's a challenge when you are dealing with companies that are global by their very nature because they don't always operate under the same legal framework as us."" Assembly members also quizzed Mr Mackey over concerns about funding and whether the Home Office would pick up the bill for the initial police response and investigation. Mr Mackey said: ""As the officer in charge last Wednesday, I never thought about money."" WhatsApp has said it is ""co-operating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations"". It comes ahead of a meeting between Home Secretary Amber Rudd and technology bosses on Thursday. Facebook, Google and Twitter are among companies that have repeatedly faced calls to do more to detect and remove jihadist and other extreme videos and web pages, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacking a ""disgusting"" failure to remove it at the weekend. Twelve people have been arrested in connection with the Westminster attack. Two remain in custody, one has been released on bail and nine have been released with no further action. An inquest for the victims - Kurt Cochran, 54; PC Keith Palmer, 48; Leslie Rhodes, 75 and Aysha Frade, 44 - will be opened at Westminster Coroner's Court later."

The 29-year-old fitness instructor from Manchester moved to Australia in 2013. According to Australian media reports at the time, Miss Tierney worked at the club and had spent the previous evening drinking with several men who fled the scene without calling for help. Police believed Miss Tierney's body lay undiscovered for up to 12 hours. Victoria Police said officers arrested a 33-year-old Melbourne man on suspicion of perjury on Tuesday as part of the investigation. The suspect, who has not been named, was released on bail pending further inquiries. After her death, Miss Tierney's family described the zumba instructor as ""the most amazing, special, caring person you could ever meet"". Her cousin Colleen Sarah said: ""Stacey was living her life to the full in Australia and she has made a huge impact on everyone who knew her."""
2017-03-29,Calls for security agencies to have access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp were raised again after the Westminster attack. Here are the questions surrounding the apps:,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170329141005/http://news.sky.com/story/messaging-apps-and-terror-seven-key-questions-10815589,"1. What is encryption? Encryption means sending information in a way that only authorised people can access it. In practice, this means the original message is scrambled using an algorithm. This creates a new message, or cyphertext, which should look like nonsense to anyone spying in. Only people with the correct decryption keys can unlock the message back into its original meaning. There are different ways to encrypt messages, and many different services, but it is fundamentally based on mathematics. 2. How does it work? Most end-to-end encrypted services rely on a public/private key encryption. Each person has two keys. The private key is yours alone, and used to decrypt messages that are sent to you. For services like iMessage and WhatsApp, this is kept on your device and done automatically. Your public key is available to anyone - it is used to encrypt messages in a way that can only be decrypted by you, with your private key. The public key is a bit like a pickup delivery locker. Anyone can put a package in for you, but only you can unlock it. 3. Which services are encrypted? Pretty much the entire digital world runs on encryption. Any message can be encrypted - and the way the internet works is by swapping messages. Encryption keeps you bank details safe when you shop online or in the real world, when you take money out of a cash machine. Every time you make a mobile phone call, it's (to some extent) encrypted. The current row focuses on messaging apps, though. Services like WhatsApp and iMessage serve more than a billion users and offer encryption. Then there is a host of other, lesser known apps, including Signal and Telegram, that offer secure private messaging. 4. Can the company (ie WhatsApp, Apple) see encrypted messages on their platforms? End-to-end encryption should mean only you and the person you are speaking with can see the message - so Apple and WhatsApp will not see it. However, if you are backing up your messages to the cloud - an option in settings - they keep this data unencrypted, and could hand it over to governments if legally obliged. 5. Can the security agencies see them? In theory, if a message is properly encrypted end-to-end, only the sender and receiver can see it. However, it is possible that a service might not be properly configured, allowing others to exploit weaknesses in the system. And there are other ways around it, including what the security services call equipment interference and what we call hacking. If someone has remote control of a user's device, they can see everything on it - including decrypted messages sitting on the phone. MI5 has said it has ""relied"" on equipment interference in the ""the overwhelming majority of high priority investigations"". 6. Would restricting encryption have stopped the Westminster attack? The Westminster attacker was using WhatsApp, but having access to his messages would not have prevented the attack - because he was not under surveillance or the subject of a warrant. Therefore GCHQ and MI5 would not have read his messages, even if they had been able to do so. 7. What is the concern about allowing official access in terrorist cases? Although Home Secretary Amber Rudd's proposal remains unclear, it seems she is suggesting a back door into these services. This sounds like the Government wants access, in special circumstances, to the private key of users. The problem is that as soon as there is a copy of a key, someone else could steal that copy. That could be a foreign government, like Russia or China, or online criminals. Nor would this necessarily prevent attacks. And if, say, WhatsApp did create a backdoor for government, there are plenty of other encrypted messaging services those determined to evade the law could use. Again, encryption relies on maths which is well understood and public knowledge. Forcing companies to create back doors would make millions of people less safe online. That may be trade off we are willing to make, but it is a choice the Government should lay out clearly."
2017-03-29,The Prime Minister has triggered Article 50 after her letter to European Council President Donald Tusk was delivered by Ambassador Sir Tim Barrow in Brussels.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170329141005/http://news.sky.com/story/article-50-triggered-formal-brexit-process-begins-10817455,"Mr Tusk immediately responded on Twitter: ""After nine months the UK has delivered. #Brexit."" :: How long until Britain leaves EU? Live countdown Kicking off the two-year process of withdrawal from the European Union, Theresa May told MPs: ""This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back."" She accepted it was ""a day of celebration for some and disappointment for others"". :: Article 50 live: It's time to leave the EU But asserted: ""Now is the time for us to come together, to be united across this House and across this country to ensure that we work for the best possible deal for the UK and the best possible future for us all."" She pledged to deliver ""the democratic will of the British people"" and to take the ""unique opportunity"" to ""shape a brighter future"" for the UK, adding: ""I choose to believe in Britain and that our best days lie ahead."" After nine months the UK has delivered. #Brexit Under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty, a tough two-year period of talks lies ahead with the 27 remaining EU member states. After marking out hard lines on future payments to the European Union and the influence of EU law after Brexit, the text of the Prime Minister's letter offered some room for manoeuvre in negotiations. Mrs May struck a note of conciliation, insisting: ""We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe - as we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent."" But she asserted that a UK exit without a deal ""is not the outcome that either side should seek"". Mr Tusk told a news conference shortly after being handed the Article 50 notice: ""There is no reason to pretend that this is a happy day, neither in Brussels nor in London. ""After all most Europeans, including almost half the British voters, wish that we would stay together, not drift apart. ""But, paradoxically, there is also something positive in Brexit. ""Brexit has made us, the community of 27 more determined and more united than before."" And in a personal message to Britain he added: ""We already miss you. Thank you and goodbye."" The European Commission, Council and Parliament have signalled that ""EU law must apply until Brexit day"" - when Britain officially leaves. The European Parliament, which can veto a UK-EU deal, is next week expected to make the guarantee of full EU citizen rights a red line - a potential sticking point which Mrs May has highlighted as a ""priority"" for the talks ahead. While Mrs May wants to negotiate a new trade deal with Europe alongside the divorce settlement, the EU has said it is reluctant to do so until after the UK has officially left. The Commission also chose the morning of the Article 50 declaration to formally block a key merger between the London Stock exchange and its German counterpart the Deutsche Borse. Some influential commentators believe this decision was a key test of the EUs attitude to negotiations with the UK. The pound pushed higher against the euro as the starting gun on Britain's formal exit from the EU was fired, climbing from a rise of 0.2% to 0.6% by the time the PM had finished addressing Parliament. There was little movement against the dollar. ""Today's the day the impossible dream came true. I'm delighted,"" former UKIP leader Nigel Farage told Sky News, responding to the triggering of Article 50.. More follows..."

Bashir was said to have beaten her with a cricket bat and forced her to drink bleach. Judge Richard Mansell QC was heavily criticised by domestic violence campaigners after he reportedly claimed Miss Karim was not vulnerable because she was ""plainly intelligent"" and had a network of friends. The court was told that if Bashir was spared custody he would be employed as a professional player by the county side. But that claim has been denied by the club. In a statement on its website, it said: ""After Monday's widely reported claim by Mustafa Bashir in his plea of mitigation following his conviction of actual bodily harm against his wife, that he had been offered a playing contract by Leicestershire County Cricket Club, the club have taken immediate steps to bring to the attention of the authorities that Bashir's claim was wholly false. ""The club's legal advisers emailed a letter to Bashir's legal team reiterating that the club had never spoken or had any contact with Bashir or offered him a job. ""They also contacted the CPS to arrange for the club's chief executive, Wasim Khan, to give a statement to the same effect. ""This has now been given to Manchester Police and they and the CPS will now be taking this matter forward."" The county side's chief executive, Wasim Khan, said: ""Leicestershire CCC are appalled that Bashir could have invented a job offer from the club in order, it would seem, to evade a prison sentence. ""The club are actively involved in the fight against domestic abuse and had already arranged a 'Bowling Out Domestic Violence' cricket match in September in support of the White Ribbon Campaign, set up to tackle domestic violence. ""So Bashir's claim was deeply disturbing for the club and we will continue to do what we can to support the authorities bring about justice."" On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the CPS said: ""We are aware of recent developments relating to this case and are currently considering our options."""

Indochinese tigers were once found widely across Asia, but now just 221 are estimated to remain in Thailand and Myanmar. Thailand's department of parks and wildlife said the breeding population found in Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai had ""remarkable resilience given wildlife poaching and illegal rosewood logging"". Footage from 156 camera traps set up around the jungle showed the cubs walking around with female Indochinese tigers. The study was set up with the help of Freeland, an organisation fighting human and animal trafficking, and Panthera, a wild cat conservation group. Panthera director John Goodrich said the discovery was ""nothing short of miraculous"". The conservation group's CEO, Alan Rabinowitz, added: ""The Thai forestry department proved that with protection you can not only bring tigers back, but now the western forest complex, specifically Huai Kha Khaeng, is a global model of tiger conservation. ""It is one of the best protected and best tiger areas left in the world."" Conservationists say aggressive poaching and the loss of habitats has caused the steep decline in the number of Indochinese tigers. Thai authorities attributed the sighting of a new breeding population with its increase in counter-poaching operations. Freeland chairman Kraisak Choonhavan said: ""It's crucial to continue the great progress made by the Thai government to bolster protection for tigers at the frontlines. ""As long as the illegal trade in tigers continues, they will need protection."""

Unions warned the increase would see a staffing crisis in the NHS get worse if wages did not keep up with the cost of food and transport. Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, said: ""This deal amounts to less than £5 a week for most midwives, nurses, cleaners, paramedics, radiographers and other healthcare staff. ""It's a derisory amount in the face of soaring fuel bills, rising food prices and increasing transport costs. ""Without the cash to hold on to experienced employees, the NHS staffing crisis will worsen as people leave for less stressful, better rewarded jobs elsewhere."" Rehana Azam, from the GMB union, said: ""Public sector workers desperately need a real pay rise, not the miserly and cruel decision being imposed on them by the Government. ""Theresa May talks about helping those who are 'just about managing', but it's clear that she doesn't include over five million public sector workers."" The Royal College of Midwives said midwives have seen their pay drop in value by more than £6,000 since 2010. Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said the announcement was a ""bitter blow"" to nursing staff across England. She said: ""The Government will deter new people from joining the nursing profession at the very moment it is failing to retain staff and European colleagues in particular head for the door."" A Department of Health spokesman said: ""The dedication and sheer hard work of our NHS staff is absolutely crucial to delivering world-class care for patients.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission has pledged to investigate the matter. Mr Wilson insisted he was ""not racist"" and said his move was an ""economic decision"". He said his stance was no different from his ban on letting his properties to smokers and dog owners. The 69-year-old said: ""There has been much support for the stance I have taken. I do not apologise for it. Faced with the same circumstances, I would do it again."" His ban came to light in a leaked email listing Mr Wilson's instructions to a letting agent for potential tenants, including: ""No coloured people because of the curry smell at the end of the tenancy."" The landlord, who owns hundreds of properties in Kent and is thought to be Britain's biggest buy-to-let investor, has also banned plumbers from renting his homes - claiming he had been ripped off in the past. He said he was happy to rent to ""negroes"" as ""they haven't generated a curry smell at the end of the tenancy"". But he said he was ""wary"" of letting to Indians after losing more than £12,000 in rent and re-carpeting costs over a six-month period because one of his properties smelled of curry. He said: ""If you want to sell your house to a market mainly composed of white British purchasers, then you considerably reduce your chances of selling by having a house that smells of curry."" Mr Wilson said the leaked email was from August last year, pre-dating his current letting criteria for 2017, drawn up last December. Anti-racism group Hope Not Hate described Mr Wilson as ""the unacceptable face of the housing crisis"" and compared him to the racist bigot Alf Garnett from BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part."

Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire told the House of Commons that: ""In the absence of devolved government, it is ultimately for the United Kingdom Government to provide for political stability and good governance."" He said the Government ""did not want to see a return to direct rule"" but would ""consider all options"" if powersharing talks failed. The joint Democratic Unionist and Sinn Fein administration collapsed in January after a row over a botched green energy scheme. No party gained a majority in the subsequent election and talks to form a new coalition executive have so far proved unsuccessful. On Monday, Mr Brokenshire said that a ""short window of opportunity"" still remained to resolve the outstanding issues between the DUP and Sinn Fein, due to the Easter recess, which lasts until 18 April. If an agreement can be reached by then Mr Brokenshire said he would seek to amend the law to allow a new executive to be formed without the need for another snap election. However, if talks failed he said that at a minimum he would bring forward legislation to ""set a regional rate"" to allow local councils in Northern Ireland to carry out their functions. Without a ruling executive or agreed budget for the upcoming financial year, control of Stormont's finances will be handed to a senior civil servant on Wednesday, subject to tight spending constraints. Mr Brokenshire repeated his view that the situation was ""not sustainable"" in the long term. He said he had spoken with the main political leaders and the Irish government since Monday and detected a ""strong willingness"" to continue the dialogue with a view to resolving the outstanding issues."

PTSD can occur when someone has been involved in an accident, war, torture, rape or other situations where they felt their life, or that of another, was in danger. Symptoms can involve intrusive and unpleasant memories, also known as flashbacks. Researchers from Oxford University and Sweden, as well as other organisations, studied 71 car crash victims admitted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Half of the group were asked to recall the incident briefly and then play the game for 20 minutes, and the rest asked to write about it - all within six hours of being admitted to hospital. Those who played the tile-matching puzzle game were found to have fewer symptoms of PTSD during the week immediately following the accident than the others. Emily Holmes, professor of psychology at Karolinska Institute's Department of Clinical Neuroscience, said: ""It would make a huge difference to a great many people if we could create simple behavioural psychological interventions using computer games to prevent post-traumatic suffering and spare them these gruelling intrusive memories. ""This is early days and more research is needed."" The study, which she undertook with her Oxford colleague Dr Lali Iyadurai, has been published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry."

Animal rights campaigners and vegans were among those to speak out last year, starting a petition when it emerged the Bank's new £5 notes contained a small amount of tallow - derived from beef suet. The polymer - or plastic - note is gradually replacing old-style paper notes as they are more robust and much harder to counterfeit. While the Bank said in February it would not be replacing the controversial fivers, or altering its plans for the launch of polymer £10 notes later this year because of the costs involved, it has been working with note suppliers to identify alternatives. They formed the view that palm oil would be best, the Bank said, though it admitted concerns from a separate independent report it commissioned that production of the vegetable oil has been linked to rainforest destruction. Its is used in the production of hundreds of foods, including chocolate, and biofuels. Commenting on the concerns, the consultation document said: ""These can be potentially mitigated by the Bank's suppliers acquiring additives that meet an associated certification standard for environmentally sustainable production."" It was also minded to take account of any extra costs and sought responses by 12 May. The document added: ""The Bank will reflect upon the various religious, ethical and environmental considerations raised by the inclusion of animal-derived additives and palm oil as the alternative."" Dr Emma Keller, agriculture commodities manager at World Wildlife Fund, said: ""WWF is encouraged to see the thorough and extensive review that the Bank of England have conducted in response to the animal fat issue in new bank notes. ""Palm oil has benefits as it produces more oil per land area than any other equivalent oil crop. Worldwide demand is expected to double again by 2050 but this expansion comes at the expense of human rights and tropical forest - which forms critical habitat for a large number of endangered wildlife - unless it is sustainable. ""People don't want the bank notes in their pocket to come with such a high environmental cost. ""The bank must only source RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) certified sustainable palm oil or none at all.""

But only about one in 400 is recycled. That is because they are made from plastic wrapped in paper - and the mixed material makes them hard to recycle. :: Sky Ocean Rescue: How to get involved To make them waterproof, the card is fused with polyethylene - a material that cannot be separated out again in a standard recycling mill. There are only two sites in the UK where the film is separated from the plastic. Academics from Cardiff University tested a series of ideas to encourage consumers to use re-usable cups. In addition to the charge, there were messages reminding people about the environmental impact of single use cups, while free re-usable cups were made available. In one cafe, the three measures combined increased the use of re-usable cups from from 5.1% to 17.4%. Professor Wouter Poortinga, who wrote the report, said that while the measures only had a ""modest"" impact when used alone, ""the greatest behavioural change was when the measures were combined"". He added: ""Our results show that, on average, the use of reusable coffee cups could be increased by up to 12.5% with a combination of measures. ""With this in mind, the UK's usage of an estimated 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups each year could be cut by up to 300 million coffee cups."" But while a charge on disposable cups had an impact, a discount on re-usable cups did not. ""People are far more sensitive to losses than to gains when making decisions,"" Professor Poortinga said. ""So if we really want to change a customer's behaviour then a charge on a disposable cup is more likely to be effective."" But the British Coffee Association disagreed with that approach. Its executive director, Chris Stemman, told Sky News: ""We believe that developing new packaging materials and enhancing recycling processes and infrastructures will have a significantly greater and longer-term impact compared with other proposed measures such as charging or taxing disposable cups."" The 5p charge for a plastic bag has had a dramatic effect - cutting their use by 85%. Andrew Pendleton from Friends of the Earth said: ""Preferably, non-recyclable paper cups should just be banned outright so that consumers can go into a cafe and simply be served with a cup that can be recycled. ""We have seen the great environmental benefits that a small charge on carrier bags has made, so we know measures like this are proven to work, and are therefore a progressive step in the right direction."""

""Not on the detail, not on the content - that is impossible in 14-15 months to do so. We need the whole transition period of two, three, four years to fill in the content of this new association agreement for the future."" He echoed the words of German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said on Wednesday that the divorce process must be concluded before any trade deals can be negotiated. Mr Verhofstadt said the EU was not in the mood to ""punish or take revenge"" on Britain - but he warned the 27 remaining nations could not allow the UK to be better off outside the bloc. He said: ""We are tough on one issue as the European Parliament, which is that we can never accept that you have a status outside the European Union more favourable than membership inside the European Union. So on that we will be unflexible."" The former Belgian PM refused to be drawn on a number for the UK's ""exit bill"" - with the EU rumoured to be expecting around £50bn. He said: ""What you need to do is make an agreement with each other on a number of key principles - 'sound accounting principles' - and when you have an agreement on that, then you apply them and you have a figure at the end. That's the way to go forward."" He said MEPs wanted to move quickly to protect the rights of citizens across the EU - including finding a way to allow UK citizens to keep EU membership rights. ""We need to examine what we can do for these UK citizens who want keep a link with EU citizenship. It is the citizens who are the victims of this whole political battle and we have to stop this,"" he said. ""We have to find a new relationship we think an association agreement is the best way to go forward."" The European Parliament, which has the power of veto on the divorce agreement, will vote next week in Strasbourg on its negotiating red lines."
2017-03-30,Samsung has unveiled new versions of its flagship smartphone as it looks to bounce back from the disaster of its fire-prone Note 7 handset.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170330130329/http://news.sky.com/story/samsung-galaxy-s8-firm-unveils-comeback-phone-after-note-7-fire-woes-10817882,"The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus bump up the screen size by doing away with a physical home button and dramatically reducing the frame - or bezel. Taking up nearly all of the front of the phone, the screen curves around the side like the previous model. The Samsung logo is gone and the home button is instead 'virtual' and on the display itself. The S8 comes in at 5.8 inches (up from 5.1 on the S7) and the Plus measures 6.2 inches (up from 5.5 on the S7 Edge). Apple's iPhone 7, one of the phone's closest rivals, is sold in 4.7 inch and 5.5-inch versions. But - possibly to cover the cost of such a fancy screen - Samsung has also significantly hiked the price. The S8 will be £689 and the Plus £779 (that's up from £569 and £639 on the S7). Tech fans saving up for the release can also look forward to trying out the firm's new Siri-like personal assistant, Bixby. The voice-activated feature can handle many of the functions done via touch and can recognise and retrieve information from the web when a user scans an object, such as an item of clothing or book, with their camera. As for the battery - which sparked last year's PR disaster and subsequent recall of the Note 7 - Samsung says the S8 cells will go through multiple inspections that include X-rays and extreme temperature stress tests. They are also said to have better longevity, retaining most of the charge after several years of use. Last year's Note 7 fire debacle, where battery problems caused some to combust, led to the device being banned from planes in the US and forced Samsung to remove the handset from sale. ""The Galaxy S8 is the most important phone for Samsung in a decade and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,"" said Ben Wood, a smartphone industry analyst with UK-based CCS Insight. Other features of the S8 include iris scanning to unlock the phone, the front-facing camera boosted from five to eight megapixels, and an optional docking station to turn the phone into a desktop computer. The new models, unveiled at dual events in London and New York, will go on general sale in the UK on 28 April and a week earlier in the US."

The Equality and Human Rights Commission has pledged to investigate the matter. Mr Wilson insisted he was ""not racist"" and said his move was an ""economic decision"". He said his stance was no different from his ban on letting his properties to smokers and dog owners. The 69-year-old said: ""There has been much support for the stance I have taken. I do not apologise for it. Faced with the same circumstances, I would do it again."" His ban came to light in a leaked email listing Mr Wilson's instructions to a letting agent for potential tenants, including: ""No coloured people because of the curry smell at the end of the tenancy."" The landlord, who owns hundreds of properties in Kent and is thought to be Britain's biggest buy-to-let investor, has also banned plumbers from renting his homes - claiming he had been ripped off in the past. He said he was happy to rent to ""negroes"" as ""they haven't generated a curry smell at the end of the tenancy"". But he said he was ""wary"" of letting to Indians after losing more than £12,000 in rent and re-carpeting costs over a six-month period because one of his properties smelled of curry. He said: ""If you want to sell your house to a market mainly composed of white British purchasers, then you considerably reduce your chances of selling by having a house that smells of curry."" Mr Wilson said the leaked email was from August last year, pre-dating his current letting criteria for 2017, drawn up last December. Anti-racism group Hope Not Hate described Mr Wilson as ""the unacceptable face of the housing crisis"" and compared him to the racist bigot Alf Garnett from BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part."
2017-03-30,"So that's it. The talking is over. Now, Britain is formally leaving the EU.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170330130329/http://news.sky.com/story/there-will-be-a-wait-to-see-what-happens-after-a-40-year-relationship-ends-10817129,"The more you think about it, the more significant this moment is. For four decades, Britain's social and economic foundations have become more and more tightly integrated with the rest of Europe. More than one in ten of all the laws passed in recent decades came from Europe. Now that process will abruptly go into reverse. The economic implications of this process are incredibly far-reaching: now that Britain can forge its own way, will it transform its economic model? Will the process of leaving the EU damage the economy? Will all those predictions about a weaker economy and poorer household incomes come true? :: Half of Britons happy Brexit talks starting Tempting as it is to assume that once Article 50 is out of the way, we will finally get answers to these questions, I wouldn't be so sure. In fact, the chances are the next few months will look rather similar to the last ones: we will still see lots of political noise as both the UK and the EU lay out their negotiating positions. It will be hard, for some time, to get a sense of where things will end up (that is what happens with negotiations). :: Tick-tock: It's the Sky Brexit Countdown And, in the absence of a sudden change of tack from either side, markets are likely to carry on what they've been doing since the dust cleared after the referendum: to tick over, until more clarity emerges about the eventual deal Britain will get. Indeed, the parameters of the negotiations have been clear for some time: before any talks about the trade deal Britain could secure with Europe, some other things will have to be cleared up. :: Brexit timetable: Guide to the next two years Among these are: the divorce proceedings themselves; the question of a cash settlement between the UK and Europe; and the question of what happens to EU assets and, crucially, to EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU. There are big question marks over the land border in Northern Ireland. So, for all the excitement over the Article 50 letter itself, the fundamentals are unlikely to shift in the coming days. :: Twenty big Brexit questions answered Instead we will hear a lot about process. We will hear about how the EU intends to respond, about how open they plan to be about their negotiating position, about the business to be discussed in the next summit in late April. There will be some discussion over whether the UK can start discussions about future ties while also negotiating the divorce (Britain wants to, the EU is apparently reluctant). :: Disunited Kingdom: Has Brexit divided the UK? Such things are incredibly exciting to policy wonks but of less significance to normal human beings. For most of us, what matters is that the economy has not fallen off a cliff in the wake of the Brexit vote, and is unlikely to fall off another one this week. However, it is worth noting that the relatively robust economic growth has started to tail off in recent months. Britain evaded a recession, but much of the consumer spending that fuelled growth in the second half of last year seems to be tailing off. :: Article 50 letter will set mood for negotiations Business investment is weak (as companies tread water to a degree as they try to work out the impact of Brexit). Inflation is rising and wage inflation is staying put. Probably, real wages are already falling. In other words, the economic backdrop is likely to look a lot less rosy over the coming year or so. Not a crisis, but not the feelgood factor. :: Brexit talks: How team UK and team EU line up That is somewhat inevitable. Until businesses and households have more sense of the eventual destination, they are quite rational to cut back on spending. The bad news is that Article 50 and the Great Repeal Bill, which has its White Paper tabled tomorrow, are likely to leave the big questions unanswered. We will need to be more patient. You can't wind up a 40-year relationship overnight."

Scotland Yard has confirmed the father-of-two was wearing one of the stab vests routinely issued to Metropolitan Police officers, but it was not enough to save him and he died at the scene. Masood, a 52-year-old Muslim convert who had been living in Birmingham, was shot dead by armed police after an 82-second rampage in which he twice drove on to the pavement of Westminster Bridge in a rented 4x4, in a deliberate attempt to target pedestrians. The inquest also heard details of the other victims of the attack, including US tourist Kurt Cochran, who suffered multiple injuries after being hit by the car. His wife Melissa suffered a broken leg and rib and cuts to her head. Mum-of-two Aysha Frade, 44, also died on the bridge, suffering head and chest injuries, while Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Clapham, also received head injuries. He was pronounced dead at London's King's College Hospital the following day.

Special report: Attack On Westminster




 The inquest, which was opened at Westminster Coroner's Court on Wednesday by senior coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox, came as Commons Speaker John Bercow told MPs there will be two reviews into security at Parliament following the attack. An independent review will look into how the perimeter fence surrounding the Parliamentary estate is secured, while a second externally led review will assess how Parliament responds to major incidents.

 Mr Bercow offered tributes to the bravery of PC Palmer, while officers held a minute's silence outside New Scotland Yard a week after the attack. Acting Met Police Commissioner Craig Mackey said: ""This afternoon is about remembering the victims of last week's events.

 ""Our thoughts, our prayers, go out to everyone who was affected by the events last week. ""I would urge you, if you get time, to go on to the bridge, talk to Londoners, talk and get a feel for this great city and how it's come together in responding to these events.""

The Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge will join families of the victims of the terror attack next Wednesday at Westminster Abbey for a 'Service of Hope'. Ten people arrested in connection with the attack have now been released with no further action to be taken. One man, a 30-year-old arrested in Birmingham, remains in custody, while a 32-year-old woman arrested in Manchester has been released on bail. Officers have carried out searches at 17 addresses across London, Brighton, Surrey, Carmarthenshire, Birmingham and Manchester. They have said 16 of these have now concluded, with one ongoing at an address in Birmingham."

2017-03-30,Calls for security agencies to have access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp were raised again after the Westminster attack. Here are the questions surrounding the apps:,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170330130329/http://news.sky.com/story/messaging-apps-and-terror-seven-key-questions-10815589,"1. What is encryption? Encryption means sending information in a way that only authorised people can access it. In practice, this means the original message is scrambled using an algorithm. This creates a new message, or cyphertext, which should look like nonsense to anyone spying in. Only people with the correct decryption keys can unlock the message back into its original meaning. There are different ways to encrypt messages, and many different services, but it is fundamentally based on mathematics. 2. How does it work? Most end-to-end encrypted services rely on a public/private key encryption. Each person has two keys. The private key is yours alone, and used to decrypt messages that are sent to you. For services like iMessage and WhatsApp, this is kept on your device and done automatically. Your public key is available to anyone - it is used to encrypt messages in a way that can only be decrypted by you, with your private key. The public key is a bit like a pickup delivery locker. Anyone can put a package in for you, but only you can unlock it. 3. Which services are encrypted? Pretty much the entire digital world runs on encryption. Any message can be encrypted - and the way the internet works is by swapping messages. Encryption keeps you bank details safe when you shop online or in the real world, when you take money out of a cash machine. Every time you make a mobile phone call, it's (to some extent) encrypted. The current row focuses on messaging apps, though. Services like WhatsApp and iMessage serve more than a billion users and offer encryption. Then there is a host of other, lesser known apps, including Signal and Telegram, that offer secure private messaging. 4. Can the company (ie WhatsApp, Apple) see encrypted messages on their platforms? End-to-end encryption should mean only you and the person you are speaking with can see the message - so Apple and WhatsApp will not see it. However, if you are backing up your messages to the cloud - an option in settings - they keep this data unencrypted, and could hand it over to governments if legally obliged. 5. Can the security agencies see them? In theory, if a message is properly encrypted end-to-end, only the sender and receiver can see it. However, it is possible that a service might not be properly configured, allowing others to exploit weaknesses in the system. And there are other ways around it, including what the security services call equipment interference and what we call hacking. If someone has remote control of a user's device, they can see everything on it - including decrypted messages sitting on the phone. MI5 has said it has ""relied"" on equipment interference in the ""the overwhelming majority of high priority investigations"". 6. Would restricting encryption have stopped the Westminster attack? The Westminster attacker was using WhatsApp, but having access to his messages would not have prevented the attack - because he was not under surveillance or the subject of a warrant. Therefore GCHQ and MI5 would not have read his messages, even if they had been able to do so. 7. What is the concern about allowing official access in terrorist cases? Although Home Secretary Amber Rudd's proposal remains unclear, it seems she is suggesting a back door into these services. This sounds like the Government wants access, in special circumstances, to the private key of users. The problem is that as soon as there is a copy of a key, someone else could steal that copy. That could be a foreign government, like Russia or China, or online criminals. Nor would this necessarily prevent attacks. And if, say, WhatsApp did create a backdoor for government, there are plenty of other encrypted messaging services those determined to evade the law could use. Again, encryption relies on maths which is well understood and public knowledge. Forcing companies to create back doors would make millions of people less safe online. That may be trade off we are willing to make, but it is a choice the Government should lay out clearly."

The 41-year-old, who has spent almost half his life behind bars, celebrated with his family and a ""good Mexican meal"". He is the second man to walk free from custody in Los Angeles in the last two weeks having been found to have been wrongfully convicted. Andrew Wilson was released on 17 March after spending 32 years in prison for a murder he said he did not commit. Both men owe their freedom to students and lawyers from the Loyola Law School's Project for the Innocent, which uncovered new evidence and pushed for new court hearings. Mr Contreras had been convicted of an attempted murder and robbery at a service station in Compton in Los Angeles in 1996. He was sentenced to life in prison plus seven years. The case relied on the evidence of a witness to the incident. Another man has now been arrested. After his release, Mr Contreras said he always believed he would win freedom: ""I just had to be patient and wait."" He said he got through his sentence by ""living the spiritual life, focusing on positive things, helping others, reaching out to others"". Professor Laurie Levenson, the Loyola professor who led the defence team, said: ""Marco Contreras didn't get out on a technicality, he got out because he's actually innocent."" She also paid tribute to prosecutors for admitting that errors had been made. ""It takes a very big person, like our district attorney, to say mistakes were made but we'd rather fix the mistakes than have the conviction. Not everyone is willing to do that."" Campaigners say that erroneous witness identifications account for three-quarters of all wrongful convictions in the US. The Loyola project first gained nationwide attention in 2013 after securing the release of Kash Delano Register, who served 34 years in prison for a murder he did not commit."

But the contract signing has been delayed as HS2 is reportedly investigating concerns from another bidder, Mace, that there may have been conflicts of interest. CH2M has been involved with HS2 Ltd since 2012 and was awarded a £350m deal to develop Phase 1 of the line from London to Birmingham. Mark Thurston, HS2 Ltd's new chief executive, is a former CH2M employee, as was his temporary predecessor Roy Hill. It has been reported that dozens of CH2M employees are also on secondment to HS2. CH2M released a statement insisting it has ""taken all appropriate measures"" in order to ""ensure the integrity of the procurement process"". It continued: ""We have taken the decision to alleviate any further delays to this critical national infrastructure project which could ultimately lead to increasing costs to UK taxpayers, as well as to our firm.""

2017-03-30,Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka has taken an unpaid job officially advising her father at the White House.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170330130329/http://news.sky.com/story/ivanka-trump-takes-job-advising-her-father-president-donald-trump-10817947,"The First Daughter, as she was nicknamed, had come under increasing pressure to formalise her role due to the amount of time she was already spending working with her father. Her husband Jared Kushner is already an unpaid but official senior adviser to the US President. In a statement Ms Trump said she would be subject to all the rules as other federal employees. She said: ""I have heard the concerns some have with my advising the president in my personal capacity while voluntarily complying with all ethics rules and I will instead serve as an unpaid employee in the White House office, subject to all of the same rules as other federal employees."" It is not clear what impact, if any, her new role will have on her self-titled clothing business. Her father agreed, as past presidents had done, to put his business interests into a trust for the period while he is commander-in-chief, but the arrangement is not a blind trust as many had called for. Questions about possible conflicts of interest that could arise as a result of Ivanka Trump's work followed an announcement on 20 March the 35-year-old would become an informal adviser to her father, with an office in the West Wing. Ethics experts said it would allow her to avoid some of the rules and disclosures that other federal employees were subject to. There were already concerns she was attending a number of top level meetings with her father despite not being an official part of the White House staff. A spokesman for the President said: ""We are pleased that Ivanka Trump has chosen to take this step in her unprecedented role as first daughter and in support of the president. ""Ivanka's service as an unpaid employee furthers our commitment to ethics, transparency, and compliance and affords her increased opportunities to lead initiatives driving real policy benefits for the American public that would not have been available to her previously."" In taking the official role she sidesteps further criticism at a time when her father's ratings are at an all-time low, following a series of policy difficulties. His average rating, according to RealClear Politics, has fallen to -11.5, with 52.9% of those polled disapproving of his actions, to 41.4% approving."
2017-03-30,The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry have stepped up their mental health campaign by commissioning a series of emotional videos they hope will encourage more people to talk.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170330130329/http://news.sky.com/story/celebrities-join-royals-emotional-mental-health-campaign-10817880,"Former England cricket captain Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff, rapper Professor Green, former spin doctor Alastair Campbell and comic Ruby Wax are some of the stars who have opened up about their mental health challenges as part of the Heads Together Campaign. The Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry asked public figures and ordinary individuals to be involved in the short videos, which show people talking to someone else about the life-changing conversations they had that helped with problems such as anxiety or depression. Heads Together is the most ambitious joint project ever launched by the royal trio. In partnership with eight charities they want to end the stigma surrounding mental health and encourage people to be as open about their mental health as their physical health. Heads Together is also the main charity partner for this year's London marathon. William, Kate and Harry said: ""When you realise that mental health problems affect your friends, neighbours, children and spouses, the walls of judgement and prejudice around these issues begin to fall. ""And we all know that you cannot resolve a mental health issue by staying silent. Attitudes to mental health are at a tipping point. ""We hope these films show people how simple conversations can change the direction of an entire life."" A YouGov poll commissioned to coincide with the release of the videos found only 46% of adults have talked recently about mental health, with men and older people still more reluctant to talk. In her video, Ruby Wax - who has been open about her battle with depression - talks with her husband, recalling how she told him that she ""was mentally ill"" as they walked down the aisle. Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff spoke about his fears that his fans would ""turn their backs"" on him if he spoke about his problems with mental health. But he found ""it was the complete opposite"". He said: ""The hardest thing for me initially was talking. I'm not a big talker, I'm from the north of England. I'm from a working class family. We don't talk about our feelings."" Professor Green, real name Stephen Manderson, who suffers from anxiety said it was important for public figures to be honest about their issues. He added: ""The problem with a lot of mental health issues - depression, anxiety, anything - is it becomes insular and you feel like you're the only one suffering with it and because you don't talk to someone about it, you don't ever realise you're not."""

Technology companies have resisted the move, saying it would make millions of users less safe online. Speaking to Sky News, the Home Secretary said: ""Just to be clear - all I am trying to have potential access to is for the intelligence services, under warrant from the Home Secretary, to be able to find out where and how the terrorists are talking to each other. ""That's completely different to what is sometimes being suggested in terms of end-to-end encryption - I don't want to do that, I recognise the importance of cyber security, a secure cyber environment is incredibly important for our economy and our country. ""But should the terrorists have somewhere safe to hide? No, I don't think they should and I'm talking to organisations to find out what else they can do to help us find a solution to this."" It is unclear what distinction the Home Secretary is drawing between different types of encryption. Technology experts say that a partial or selective weakening of encryption on an app is impossible. Antony Walker, deputy CEO of TechUK, a trade association for tech organisations, told Sky News: ""End-to-end encryption is incredibly important to the UK's national security. ""The question is then: what role does it play in terms of these messaging services? ""What is very clear is that end-to-end encryption is binary: you either have it or you don't. ""There's no real way you can have a back door into these services that won't eventually become an open door to criminals and terrorists and hostile states."" In fact, the Government already has the legal power to compel technology companies to hand over unencrypted data, as part of the Investigatory Powers Act, or so-called Snoopers' Charter, passed last year. So far, this power remains untested. Lord Carlile QC, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told Sky News: ""The Government has little appetite for either going to court against technology companies or enlarging the legal provisions. ""And they're right about that. It is to be hoped that technology companies can be persuaded they should co-operate fully. ""If they don't of course, we'll have to think again."" On Wednesday, the acting head of Scotland Yard, Craig Mackey, said the Westminster attack must act as a ""wake up"" call for tech companies."

A statement added that the terrain was ""described as very difficult and challenging"". Superintendent Gareth Evans said: ""The aircraft, a red Twin Squirrel helicopter had failed to arrive in Dublin from Luton yesterday afternoon instigating a full sea and then land search and rescue operation."" The search had been ""co-ordinated by North Wales Police in Snowdonia involving all local and RAF Mountain Rescue Teams"". Superintendent Evans said conditions were ""described as atrocious with visibility down to less than 10 metres in places"", adding that the area was ""remote and in places hazardous"". Formal identification of those on board the helicopter is yet to take place, while their families are being supported by Police Family Liaison Officers. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch will lead an investigation. The search began after the privately-owned aircraft went missing on Wednesday afternoon. The Twin Squirrel is described as a light utility helicopter. Introduced in the mid-1970s, it is said to need little maintenance and has a reputation for durability. Anyone who may have seen the helicopter flying over Snowdonia is asked to call police in 101."

The decision highlights the pressure felt by financial services firms to secure their continued access to the bloc once the UK leaves as so-called passport rights - which currently allow them to trade seamlessly across borders - are expected to be lost. Lloyd's, which derives 10% of its revenue from the EU, said it intended to have the Brussels office ""ready to write business"" for the 1 January 2019 renewal season, subject to regulatory approval. It had considered Luxembourg instead. Chief executive, Inga Beale, said: ""It is important that we are able to provide the market and customers with an effective solution that means business can carry on without interruption when the UK leaves the EU. ""Brussels met the critical elements of providing a robust regulatory framework in a central European location, and will enable Lloyd's to continue to provide specialist underwriting expertise to our customers. ""I am excited about the opportunities this venture will offer the market by providing that important European access efficiently."" Lloyd's has not been alone in mulling its response. Large investment banks are also weighing the future of their UK-based operations, with Sky News revealing that Deutsche Bank had signed a 25-year lease on a new City base. Goldman Sachs signalled earlier this week that it was accelerating plans to create more jobs on the Continent, with its London-based operations calling a halt to expansion. JPMorgan, HSBC and UBS have also given strong indications that thousands of jobs may cross the Channel or go to Dublin. Ms Beale called for the EU and UK to come to a sensible compromise in their looming divorce deal. She said: ""It is now crucial that the UK Government and the European Union proceed to negotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU. ""I believe it is important not just for the City but also for Europe that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We stand ready to help and support the Government as best we can."" Lloyd's made the announcement as it published annual results - with 2016 profits flat on the previous 12 months. It said pricing pressures made for an ""extremely challenging"" environment despite gross written premiums rising 11%. Pre-tax profits came in a £2.1bn."

It's an early announcement from the festival, which often waits until later in the year to announce acts appearing. In 2016 the poster wasn't released until the end of May and in 2015 the full line-up wasn't announced until the final few weeks before the festival. This year's festival will be the last for two years, as it will take a break next year before moving to a new site in 2019."

In a statement, her relatives told of their ""crushing pain"" and the ""eternal void"" which has been left in their hearts following her death. The 44-year-old victim was described as a ""guardian angel"" who ""never shied away from facing up to bullies"". Her relatives also said she was a ""caring daughter, loving sister, amazing wife, irreplaceable aunt, thoughtful, supportive friend and the best and coolest of mummies"". They added: ""We now pray that you guide and protect not only us, but all of London, from further evil. ""There are no words to even begin to describe the crushing pain and eternal void left in our hearts."" Mrs Frade and two other civilians - Kurt Cochran, 54, and 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes - were killed when Masood deliberately drove his car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The terrorist then fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer, 48, in the grounds of Parliament before he was shot dead by another officer. An inquest has heard PC Palmer died from a single stab wound to the chest, despite wearing protective body armour. Police believe Masood acted alone but are continuing to investigate whether anyone else was involved. Thousands of people linked hands on Westminster Bridge and police held a minute's silence outside New Scotland Yard on Wednesday, a week on from the attack. Meanwhile, officers have released without charge a 58-year-old man who was arrested in Birmingham last week in connection with the incident. They are continuing to question a 30-year-old man and a woman has been released on bail, while 10 have now been released with no further action."

Photos and videos of the vehicles appeared to indicate they had been involved in a head-on collision. It occurred about 75 miles (120km) west of San Antonio, on US highway 83, in Uvalde County. It is not known how many of those who died were travelling in the pick-up truck and how many in the minibus. All of the occupants of the minibus were 55 or over, police said. The cause of the crash is also yet to be determined. Officials at the First Baptist Church, New Braunfels, where the van was based, said members had spent three days at the Alto Frio Baptist Encampment before setting off to return. The retreat was about nine miles (14km) north of where the crash happened. Officials were ""ministering to family members to help them deal with this tragedy"", a statement on the church's website said.

Under the proposed rules, behaviour calculated to cause maximum distress - such as sending images to a victim's family who are very religious or to a young sibling - would attract a sentence at the upper end of the scale. Meanwhile, cases which are ""sophisticated"" or involve significant planning would also be regarded as particularly serious - for example setting up fake social media profiles or websites in the victim's name to upload offending material. Offenders who circulate pictures widely, or in large numbers, would also be dealt with in the most serious bracket. The proposals, drawn up by the Sentencing Council, have gone out for consultation. If they are added to sentencing guidelines the rules must be followed, unless a judge or magistrate feels it is not in the interests of justice to do so. Justice Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""Revenge porn is an awful abuse of trust which can leave victims feeling humiliated and degraded. ""By making it a specific offence, we sent a clear message that this crime will not be tolerated. ""It is right that our courts recognise the severity of this crime, and I welcome the Sentencing Council's proposals."" Domestic abuse, harassment, stalking, controlling behaviour and threats to kill are also covered by the Sentencing Council's draft guidelines on ""intimidatory"" crimes. Sentencing Council member Mrs Justice McGowan said: ""These offences can be particularly sensitive and distressing, leading to very significant harm to victims. ""The new guidelines we are proposing will help ensure sentences reflect the seriousness of these offences and take into account the increases in sentence levels for stalking and harassment introduced by Parliament."""

The Bill will do two things: firstly repeal the European Communities Act (1972) which took Britain into the bloc, and also copy up to 20,000 pieces of EU law onto the UK statute book. Brexit Secretary David Davis said: ""Converting EU law into UK law, and ending the supremacy of lawmakers in Brussels, is an important step in giving businesses, workers and consumers the certainty they need. ""And it will mean that as we seek a comprehensive new economic partnership with the EU, our allies will know that we start from a position where we have the same standards and rules."" :: Security is Theresa May's Brexit secret weapon The Government acknowledges that once the EU legislative acts are transferred over, up to 1,000 will need to be corrected in order to work effectively. It could use the controversial ""Henry VIII clause"" to speed up that process. That is the way a government can amend existing law without recourse to Parliament, which has sent alarm bells ringing among opposition politicians and constitutional historians. :: What does Theresa May's Brexit letter tell us? However, the Government insists it will only use secondary legislation to amend laws, not shape policy, and will allow ""appropriate scrutiny"". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady warned that the UK should use the Great Repeal Bill to ""sign up to a level playing field with our EU partners, not a race to the bottom on workplace rights"". She said: ""We don't want hardworking Brits to miss out on new rights that workers in other European nations get."" The logistical challenge is undoubtedly immense and almost every area of Government will be impacted. New regulatory frameworks will have to be fleshed out on everything from medicines to banking. :: The full text of Britain's Article 50 letter The devolved assemblies are also worried that the Government will use the Great Repeal Bill as an opportunity to power grab, despite promising to give more powers to the nations. A Government spokesman also tried to reassure Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that their governments would be given ""equivalent means to correct EU law that has been implemented at a devolved level"". But the SNP's Stephen Gethins told Sky News that the Government had been ""very reluctant"" to offer more detail. He said: ""I know there has been all this talk about the Henry VIII clause and the royal prerogative, for a campaign that wanted to bring back control from the European Union they are not giving Parliament much of a say in this process."""

It could be replaced with an Australian-style points system under which all migrants would be subject to the same rules, and could be selectively refused entry. :: Going bananas At the other end of the seriousness scale are EU rules on wonky bananas. They are not banned, but they are classified by quality and shape. Class 1 bananas can have ""slight defects of shape"" and Class 2 bananas full-on ""defects of shape"". Regulations became a lightning rod for all who despair at the pointlessness of Brussels and its ideas. :: The Human Rights Act Expect howls of protest from Remainers, but Justice Secretary Liz Truss has already signalled that laws protecting our right to a private life and personal liberty will be replaced by a British Bill of Rights. It has been used by foreign criminals in Britain as a means to avoid deportation. :: Toasters, kettles and vacuum cleaners European Commission rules, introduced in 2013, demand vacuum cleaners make efficient use of electricity and the EU is threatening to extend those rules to kettles, hair dryers, toasters and other household items. Once out of the EU, Parliament can decide whether the British should once again be able to buy inefficient electrical goods. :: VAT on energy bills All that inefficient use of power will mean higher bills, so many Britons, especially those on lower incomes, will be glad the UK government will be able to remove VAT from gas and electricity bills, but environmental campaigners may object that it is not green. :: The tampon tax Remember the long argument about VAT on sanitary goods, dubbed the 'tampon tax?' That one was eventually scrapped, and once out of the EU, the Treasury will no longer be bound by strict EU regulations on what goods and services VAT will be applied to and at what rate, so Philip Hammond can decide to remove it from anything else he fancies. :: Working Time Directive A big one this, as under EU law, it is illegal to make an employee work for an average of more than 48 hours a week.Employers may put pressure on ministers to pull out of this, as it is estimated to cost them £4bn a year. :: Fishing Another symbolic law that Leave campaigners can not wait to ditch. Boris Johnson described the quotas imposed by the Common Fisheries Policy as ""crazy"". So, Brexit may turn out to be good news for the British fishing fleets, but others are sure to complain. :: Temporary Agency Workers Directive This guarantees anyone hired via employment agencies gets the same pay and conditions as employees in the same business doing the same work and is thought to cost employers half as much as the working time directive. Abolishing it could be unpopular politically, however, as free marketeers, the UK will not want more interference in the economy. :: Renewables Directive Reckoned by some to be the single most expensive piece of Brussels-imposed legislation, it sets targets for combating climate change, such as achieving a 20% share of energy from renewable sources by 2020, at a reputed cost of £4.7bn a year. Brexiteers tend to be sceptical about climate change, so may see this as a useful way to save money."

Beatty's fellow gong presenter Faye Dunaway then wrongly announced to the audience, and millions of people watching at home on TV, that the musical had won the top prize. La La Land's makers and cast started celebrating on stage, before it was soon revealed by one of the producers that Moonlight had in fact triumphed. New rules will be introduced from next year following a ""thorough review"" of the incident, said Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs. The accountants will be banned from using electronic devices backstage, including posting on social media such as Twitter. Mr Cullinan had tweeted photos before the infamous mix-up, including one of Stone backstage. Ms Boone Isaacs said Mr Cullinan's distraction caused the error on 26 February. It has also been decided a third PwC accountant will work in the Oscars control room, who would be able to immediately tell the director if there was a mistake. Other new measures include closer checks of the winners' envelopes on stage and rehearsals with the accountants before the ceremony, Ms Boone Isaacs added. In a letter to members, she announced the ""board has decided to continue working with PwC"", which tallies up their votes for different categories in the awards. Cullinan and fellow PwC accountant Martha Ruiz were told they would never work at the Oscars again following the most high-profile error in the show's history. PwC took responsibility for the shambles, saying the pair made ""a series of mistakes"" and failed to follow established backstage protocols."
2017-03-30,England's health watchdog says sugar reduction targets for the food industry intended to tackle the childhood obesity crisis can be met - despite only being voluntary.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170330130329/http://news.sky.com/story/chocolate-bars-could-shrink-in-health-watchdog-bid-to-cut-obesity-10817971,"Public Health England (PHE) has published guidelines for the food industry to cut overall sugar content across nine food groups - including chocolate confectionary, cakes and biscuits - by 20% in the next three years. PHE believes the voluntary measures will cut 200,000 tonnes of sugar from children's diets each year and contribute to a 20% reduction in the number of overweight children in the next decade. Currently a third of 11 year-olds are overweight and obesity is considered one of the gravest public health issues facing the NHS. Under the guidelines, firms have been asked to reduce sugar by 5% this year and 20% by 2020. However, there are no penalties for companies that miss the targets - meaning the Government's central strategy for tackling obesity is reliant on goodwill from manufacturers. MPs on the House of Commons Health Select Committee are among critics who have accused the Government of watering down the strategy, but PHE says it believes the scheme will work. Chief executive Duncan Selbie said: ""We asked for this to be a voluntary plan because we did not want to spend two years trying to regulate and arguing whether a Jaffa cake was a biscuit or a cake. ""We think this is actually a pro-business plan, and this is the most ambitious anti-obesity plan anywhere in the world. ""British food manufacturers will be leading the world in this."" Food producers can meet the targets in three ways; by reformulating food with less sugar, increasing the volume of lower-sugar products they sell, or by reducing portion sizes. The measures are intended to lead to lower sugar content across all categories, but the confectionary sector may be forced to reduce the size of chocolate bars and sweets. Given the high volume of sugar in confectionary reducing portion size may be the only relevant option, a move that could prove controversial with consumers if it is not accompanied by a price cut. The targets also apply to restaurants, fast food and coffee outlets, known as the ""out-of-home"" sector, which accounts for 20-30% of all food consumption and typically sells food with a higher proportion of sugar than the retail sector. Mr Selbie insisted he is not instructing manufacturers to make smaller chocolate bars, but said the obesity crisis was too grave to ignore. He said: ""This is not moralistic and it is not hysterical, this is about children and we have a problem."""

She was hit by a suspected stolen Ford Fiesta while walking in the town with her grandmother, Angela French, who was injured in the crash. Aidan McAteer appeared at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Friday charged with causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and stealing a black Ford Fiesta on 20 March. The 23-year-old, of no fixed address, was remanded in custody until a preliminary hearing at Liverpool Crown Court on 26 April. That is along with another man, Dean Brennan, 27, who appeared before the same court on Wednesday charged with assisting an offender, theft of a motor vehicle and being carried in a stolen vehicle. McAteer had been sought by police following the crash. Earlier this week, his mother, Alicia McAteer, 41, appealed for him to return home. Violet-Grace's mother, Rebecca Youens, paid tribute to her daughter. ""My beautiful baby girl passed away in my arms on 25/03/2017 at 23:38,"" she said in a Facebook post.

He was released pending further inquiries."
2017-03-31,"The Great Repeal Bill could see several of the best-known, and a few of the more obscure, EU rules and regulations scrapped.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/great-repeal-bill-could-see-these-10-eu-laws-abolished-10817936,":: Free movement of labour A symbol of all that is wrong with the European Union for Brexiteers, but sceptics doubt whether ditching it will give ministers the absolute control of immigration they crave. It could be replaced with an Australian-style points system under which all migrants would be subject to the same rules, and could be selectively refused entry. :: Toasters, kettles and vacuum cleaners European Commission rules, introduced in 2013, demand vacuum cleaners make efficient use of electricity and the EU is threatening to extend those rules to kettles, hair dryers, toasters and other household items. Once out of the EU, Parliament can decide whether the British should once again be able to buy inefficient electrical goods. :: VAT on energy bills All that inefficient use of power will mean higher bills, so many Britons, especially those on lower incomes, will be glad the UK government will be able to remove VAT from gas and electricity bills, but environmental campaigners may object that it is not green. Remember the long argument about VAT on sanitary goods, dubbed the tampon tax? David Cameron and George Osborne wanted to scrap the levy but EU regulations meant they could only drop it to 5%. It is supposed to go completely in 2018 because of new a change in position by the Brussels, but once out of the bloc the Treasury will be able to set its own rules on the good and services that VAT will be applied to and at what rate. :: Working Time Directive A big one this, as under EU law, it is illegal to make an employee work for an average of more than 48 hours a week.Employers may put pressure on ministers to pull out of this, as it is estimated to cost them £4bn a year. :: Fishing Another law that Leave campaigners can not wait to ditch. Boris Johnson described the quotas imposed by the Common Fisheries Policy as ""crazy"". So, Brexit may turn out to be good news for the British fishing fleets, but others are sure to complain. :: Temporary Agency Workers Directive This guarantees anyone hired via employment agencies gets the same pay and conditions as employees in the same business doing the same work and is thought to cost employers half as much as the working time directive. Abolishing it could be unpopular politically, however, as free marketeers the UK will not want more interference in the economy. :: Renewables Directive Reckoned by some to be the single most expensive piece of Brussels-imposed legislation, it sets targets for combating climate change, such as achieving a 20% share of energy from renewable sources by 2020, at a reputed cost of £4.7bn a year. Brexiteers tend to be sceptical about climate change, so may see this as a useful way to save money. :: Going bananas At the other end of the seriousness scale are EU rules on wonky bananas. They are not banned, but they are classified by quality and shape. Class 1 bananas can have ""slight defects of shape"" and Class 2 bananas full-on ""defects of shape"". Myths about the regulations became a lightning rod for all who despair at the pointlessness of Brussels and its ideas."
2017-03-31,Two pilots were left stunned when their passenger jet was involved in a near-miss with a large drone.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/was-that-a-drone-pilots-shock-at-near-miss-on-approach-to-heathrow-10819291,"The plane was approaching Heathrow Airport in west London when they spotted the gadget, which had multiple arms and up to eight rotors. They both exclaimed: ""Was that a drone? At 10,000 feet!"" There was ""no time to react"" as they watched the drone for around five seconds as it passed down the right side of the jet, according to a report by the UK Airprox Board (UKAB). Police officers at the airport were alerted, but the operator of the drone could not be traced. The pilots estimated the separation between the aircraft and the drone was 100ft (30 metres) vertically and 200 metres (656ft) horizontally. The UKAB concluded that ""safety was not assured"" during the incident on 11 November, and deemed the risk to be the second most serious category. The incident was revealed in the latest report from the UKAB, which said there were four near-misses in the last month. It brings the total over the last 12 months to 59. In one incident last July, a drone ""narrowly avoided"" crashing into a passenger plane as it flew near The Shard. The Airbus 320, which had 165 passengers on board, was making its final approach to Heathrow when it was involved in a ""very near miss"". Drones must not be flown above 400ft near airports or airfields, according to Civil Aviation Authority rules. In November the CAA launched a website to publish its revised code of conduct for drones, called the dronecode. The Government is considering mandatory registration for new drones to crack down on reckless users as part of a Department for Transport consultation on improving drone safety. It is hoped the scheme could help authorities identify the owners of drones being flown illegally."

He said: ""A big mistake that we could make from both sides is to start with launching threats to each other. ""I find the letter of Mrs May very constructive, generally, but there is also one threat in it, in saying 'look, we want also to co-operate with you on security issues in our common fight against terrorism but you have to give us a good deal on trade and economy'. ""It doesn't work like that - you cannot use, or abuse, I should say, the security of citizens to have then a good deal on something else."" :: EU fires back after May pulls Brexit trigger Earlier, Brexit Secretary David Davis told Sky News Mrs May was not using security as ""a bargaining chip"". He said: ""What she said was that if we don't have a deal, it's not good for either side."" Mr Davis said that as one of the longest-serving home secretaries in modern history, Mrs May took the issue very, very seriously. He said: ""We are going to have, going through this process, lots of times where we say 'this is a good outcome, this is a bad outcome'."" Mr Verhofstadt, a former Belgian Prime Minister and now a key player in the upcoming negotiations, said that the UK was being ""very naive"" to think that an exit and trade deal can be conducted in the timetable available. He said: ""You need to do the withdrawal agreement and you have to have an agreement on what I should call the 'general terms' of your future relationship. ""Not on the detail, not on the content - that is impossible in 14-15 months to do so. We need the whole transition period of two, three, four years to fill in the content of this new association agreement for the future."" He echoed the words of German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said on Wednesday that the divorce process must be concluded before any trade deals can be negotiated. Mr Verhofstadt said the EU was not in the mood to ""punish or take revenge"" on Britain - but he warned the 27 remaining nations could not allow the UK to be better off outside the bloc. He said: ""We are tough on one issue as the European Parliament, which is that we can never accept that you have a status outside the European Union more favourable than membership inside the European Union. So on that we will be unflexible."" The former Belgian PM refused to be drawn on a number for the UK's ""exit bill"" - with the EU rumoured to be expecting around £50bn. He said: ""What you need to do is make an agreement with each other on a number of key principles - 'sound accounting principles' - and when you have an agreement on that, then you apply them and you have a figure at the end. That's the way to go forward."" He said MEPs wanted to move quickly to protect the rights of citizens across the EU - including finding a way to allow UK citizens to keep EU membership rights. ""We need to examine what we can do for these UK citizens who want keep a link with EU citizenship. It is the citizens who are the victims of this whole political battle and we have to stop this,"" he said. ""We have to find a new relationship we think an association agreement is the best way to go forward."" The European Parliament, which has the power of veto on the divorce agreement, will vote next week in Strasbourg on its negotiating red lines."

Critics have attacked the bill for creating sweeping temporary powers to allow ministers to tweak laws that would otherwise not ""work appropriately"". :: 'We need each other': EU leaders react to Article 50 letter The use of the so-called Henry VIII powers allows the Government to pass up to 1,000 pieces of secondary legislation without close parliamentary scrutiny. But Mr Davis said any powers created in this way would be ""time-limited"" and that ""Parliament will need to be satisfied that the procedures are appropriate"". :: Twenty big Brexit questions answered now Article 50 has been triggered Speaking in the Commons, he told MPs: ""We have been clear that we want a smooth and orderly exit, and the Great Repeal Bill is integral to that approach. ""It will provide clarity and certainty for businesses, workers and consumers across the United Kingdom on the day we leave the EU. ""It will mean that as we exit the EU and seek a new deep and special partnership with the European Union, we will be doing so from the position where we have the same standards and rules. :: Article 50 letter: The full text ""But it will also ensure that we deliver on our promise to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK as we exit. ""Our laws will then be made in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast and interpreted not by judges in Luxembourg but by judges across the United Kingdom."" The bill will repeal the European Communities Act 1972, which provides legal underpinning for Britain's EU membership. It will also end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). :: Brexit effect finally taking hold as prices rise The announcement comes a day after Theresa May triggered Article 50, starting the process which will take the UK out of the European Union in the next two years. In a foreword to the paper, the Prime Minister said the bill would ""provide maximum certainty as we leave the EU"", allowing businesses, public officials and individuals to plan for the future while Brexit negotiations are ongoing. ""The Great Repeal Bill is an important part of our plan to deliver a smooth and orderly Brexit that commands the confidence of all,"" she said.

Labour MP Chuka Umunna, chairman of Vote Leave Watch, described the Great Repeal Bill as ""an immense undertaking, fraught with danger"". ""Right-wing Tory Brexiteers like Liam Fox and Priti Patel have spent years waiting for this moment to cut the rights of British working people,"" he said. ""From anti-discrimination laws to the Social Chapter to ECJ case law providing holiday pay, too many Conservatives see Brexit as a chance for a damaging bonfire of regulations."" :: Who is your Brexit hero? Have your say here Liberal Democrat chief whip Tom Brake said: ""Theresa May and her ministers are resembling a medieval court more and more every single day.

It marks the first step in the Government's effort to complete a programme of sales that will allow B&B to repay its £15.65bn debt to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and corresponding loan from the Treasury. Its mortgage book and investment portfolios were transferred to Government control when B&B was effectively nationalised in 2008 as banks ran into financial trouble. B&B's bank's deposits and branch network were bought by Abbey National - and are now under the Santander brand. Friday's announcement coincides with Government efforts to fully return its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to private hands by this summer following its bailout. The weight of legacy issues at Royal Bank of Scotland has proved to be a brake on its share sale process. It remains over 70% taxpayer owned. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: ""The sale of these Bradford & Bingley assets for £11.8bn marks another major milestone in our plan to get taxpayers' money back following the financial crisis. ""We are determined to return the financial assets we own to the private sector and today's sale is further proof of the confidence investors have in the UK economy."" The Treasury said it aimed to have completed its programme of B&B loan sales by the end of the 2017/18 tax year but it would only proceed if value for money was assured. It did say the fair value of the B&B loan book was less than its book value, ""reflecting the low interest rates payable on the loans."" UK Asset Resolution, known as UKAR, manages Bradford & Bingley's closed loan books on the Treasury's behalf. Its chief executive, Ian Hares, added: ""This sale of assets is a significant milestone in the phased repayment of the FSCS loan extended to Bradford & Bingley and when complete will reduce UKAR's balance sheet to £22bn from£116bn in 2010 when it was formed."""

It said: ""Think it's safe to go back in the water? Think again! A bull shark washed up in Ayr. Stay out of floodwater."" Emergency crews have been forced to rescue dozens of people from floodwaters since the Category 4 storm first hit the coast between Bowen and Airlie Beach on Tuesday. The region is still being experiencing torrential rain and damaging gusts of wind, which have hampered relief efforts. ""We have a very, very large state here and this is a very, very big weather system that's going to wreak havoc all the way down the coast,"" Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. The storm has been downgraded to a tropical low as it heads southeast towards Brisbane. The city was drenched by a month's worth of rain in a single day, according to meteorologists and theme parks and beaches along the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast were closed. Some towns remain cut off by flooding as water levels continue to rise in many areas and have spread to include the neighbouring state of New South Wales. However, only one significant injury has been reported as a result of the storm, a man crushed by a collapsing wall. Among the areas worst hit by the storm were the Great Barrier Reef Islands, which experienced winds of more than 160 mph at the height of the cyclone. Hundreds of residents and tourists are now being evacuated from the Hamilton and Daydream Islands after struggling with no power and toilets not flushing as water ran low. Around 1,300 soldiers have been mobilised to help with the clean-up and deliver emergency supplies. Farming is a major industry in the area, with officials saying the economic cost to the area will be huge. ""Producers in the Whitsunday area were planting winter vegetables and they're expected to suffer heavy crop losses as well as infrastructure, crop and irrigation equipment damage,"" said Queensland's Rural Economic Development Minister Bill Byrne. ""In the Mackay district, it's understood that the cane fields at Proserpine, Mackay and Sarina have been flattened."""

""To some extent, this is the dog that hasn't barked yet,"" she said. ""We have hedging positions, to protect us against currency movements, but those are starting to come off now, so we're waiting to see the full impact. ""In the non-food sector, component parts are often imported, even if they're assembled here. But what that will do to prices, I just can't say. But I will say that, John Lewis being never knowingly undersold, we will be the last to move. ""It is very hard to predict what will happen to prices, simply because it varies on country of manufacture, on category, almost product by product. ""It is a very competitive market and I don't believe that the full amount of an increase will be able to be passed on. ""Some items are made here in the UK - furniture and bedding for instance, so they may be somewhat insulated. ""It is possible that, over time, more manufacturing gets repatriated to the UK but that is dependent on UK plc than on our desire - there is less manufacturing here than there was 50 years ago. ""Much will depend on how long the currency situation persists as it is as the moment, and also on logistics."" Ms Nickolds said she had ""two significant concerns"" around Brexit that she would place most emphasis on - ""trading arrangements and the experience of EU nationals working for John Lewis"" - but said she did not have a view on the ""ideal outcome"" of negotiations around the UK's exit from the European Union. Ms Nickolds did say she had taken over the retailer at a ""structurally challenging time"" for UK retailers, with a huge rise in online shopping in a ""pretty volatile environment"". ""Many people have predicted the death of department stores, just as many people have predicted the death of the high street. I don't accept that, but I do think we will have to change."" By 2020, she expects half of John Lewis's sales to be made online, and also said she hopes half of the shop's range will be exclusive own brand products. The number of new shops will be slowed down, but she retains the commitment to the retailer's famous price-matching promise of never being undersold. ""There is a huge amount of expectation and responsibility. This is a big job, but John Lewis also occupies a place in the heart and minds of our customers,"" she said. Ms Nickolds said part of the future of John Lewis would be to help customers to ""live well and feel well"" and to concentrate on experiences. ""We don't just sell you a mattress, we sell you a great night's sleep,"" she said. She made her comments just weeks after the wider partnership, which also includes Waitrose, slashed bonuses despite a leap in profits in a new bid to save costs and focus resources on its customer offering. John Lewis had previously announced 400 job losses across its restaurants and home fittings service."

2017-03-31,Patients will have to wait longer for non-urgent operations and go without some new drugs under new plans.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/waiting-times-to-increase-in-nhs-england-trade-off-10818805,"Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, has revealed his blueprint for how the service will cope with huge clinical and financial pressures over the next two years. The plans contain measures to deal with an ageing population and growing demand at a time when the NHS budget is under huge pressure and growing at the slowest rate in its 69-year history. These include better coordinated local care, 150 new urgent treatment centres as an alternative to A&E, and extending GP services in an attempt to vacate up to 3,000 hospital beds. Speaking to NHS staff at a heath centre in Aldershot, Mr Stevens said: ""These are practical next steps we can take to improve health care for the people of this country. ""We get the fact this is a time of real pressure in the NHS, but there are things that we can be very proud of too."" Ahead of the announcement, Mr Stevens said the plans involved a ""trade-off"" that will see some waiting times increase, ""hundreds of thousands"" of patients no longer referred to hospital consultants, and new drugs not automatically prescribed. The NHS target is for 92% of patients to be treated within 18 weeks of referral but this has not been met since February 2016. Mr Stevens also acknowledged the national A&E target of 95% of patients waiting no more than four hours would not be met until the end of 2018. It comes two months after the worst A&E performance statistics on record, with the traditional winter challenges exacerbated by the number of elderly patients waiting for social care occupying hospital beds. Mr Stevens said: ""We are saying that we expect that the number of operations that the NHS pays for will continue to go up, but we recognise that - right now about nine out of 10 people get their operations in under 18 weeks - in some parts of the country that will be under pressure. ""We do say here there is a trade off... we do expect there will be some marginal lengthening of waiting lists but this will still represent a strong, quick waiting times experience compared to 10 years ago, let alone 20."" Mr Stevens said the NHS had to adapt if it was to remain sustainable, but declined to comment on the level of funding. In January, he said the Prime Minister was ""stretching it"" when she claimed the NHS had received more money than it had asked for. Mr Stevens added: ""What we are saying is that we have a health service that is bigger year on year. ""What we also recognise is that a combination of a growing and ageing population, the number of new treatments that are coming on and the rise in demand being experienced means that we have to make some choices."" ""We accept that the 2017/18 budget for the National Health Service is fixed, and so we've set out what we intend to do within the budget that's available."" Under the plans, hospitals will also be incentivised to help people stop smoking. Doctors' leaders and hospital trusts welcomed some elements of the plan, but said the NHS's challenges could only fully be addressed by more funding. Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association, said: ""It contains a lot of good provisions but the big problem is… that it doesn't provide an answer to the single crushing problem that permeates health and social care at the moment, and that's a deliberate long term chronic under-funding."" Shadow health minister Jonathan Ashworth MP said the waiting time increases were ""a direct result of the financial crisis"". He said: ""The collapse in standards in the past year has been nothing short of astonishing."""

Police confirmed a male cyclist died at the scene of the accident on the Monaro Highway near Williamsdale around 6:30am local time on Friday. In a statement the race organisers said Hall would be ""sorely missed"" and his death was ""a great loss to the global cycling community"". ""Mike revelled in the spirit and adventure of ultra-endurance cycling events"" they said. ""Mike's efforts in both raising money and the spirit of others were tremendous and he leaves an incredible legacy."" The race was called off following the crash and a tribute ride is now being planned in Sydney on Sunday. Hall was originally from Harrogate, North Yorkshire and lived in Monmouthshire, South Wales. He won the 2012 World Cycle Race, was twice winner of the Tour Divide and won the 2014 TransAm Bicycle Ride. Following the news of his death ultra-triathlete Sean Conway said on Twitter: ""Today is a very, very sad day. Cycling has lost a legend"". An online funding site set up to help Hall's family has seen tributes pour in to the veteran cyclist. The site's organiser James Hayden hailed him ""a shining light in many of our lives, enabling us to find the best of ourselves"" and said he would be remembered for his ""kindness, good heart and bravery"". Posting on the site one donor said: ""Mike Hall inspired me to ride bikes and ride them far. ""A true loss to the endurance cycling community."" Hall's bike supplier, Kinesis UK, said on Instagram they were ""shocked and stunned by the tragedy"".

2017-03-31,A man has walked free from court after spending 20 years in jail for a crime he did not commit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/marco-contreras-freed-after-serving-20-years-for-crime-he-did-not-commit-10817968,"Marco Contreras was ordered to be released by a judge in Los Angeles after he was declared factually innocent. The 41-year-old, who has spent almost half his life behind bars, celebrated with his family and a ""good Mexican meal"". He is the second man to walk free from custody in Los Angeles in the last two weeks having been found to have been wrongfully convicted. Andrew Wilson was released on 17 March after spending 32 years in prison for a murder he said he did not commit. Both men owe their freedom to students and lawyers from the Loyola Law School's Project for the Innocent, which uncovered new evidence and pushed for new court hearings. Mr Contreras had been convicted of an attempted murder and robbery at a service station in Compton in Los Angeles in 1996. He was sentenced to life in prison plus seven years. The case relied on the evidence of a witness to the incident. Another man has now been arrested. After his release, Mr Contreras said he always believed he would win freedom: ""I just had to be patient and wait."" He said he got through his sentence by ""living the spiritual life, focusing on positive things, helping others, reaching out to others"". Professor Laurie Levenson, the Loyola professor who led the defence team, said: ""Marco Contreras didn't get out on a technicality, he got out because he's actually innocent."" She also paid tribute to prosecutors for admitting that errors had been made. ""It takes a very big person, like our district attorney, to say mistakes were made but we'd rather fix the mistakes than have the conviction. Not everyone is willing to do that."" Campaigners say that erroneous witness identifications account for three-quarters of all wrongful convictions in the US. The Loyola project first gained nationwide attention in 2013 after securing the release of Kash Delano Register, who served 34 years in prison for a murder he did not commit."

Jim Barrow, 48, was on his way home from work when he saw a rescue helicopter arrive at the scene. He said: ""It's not the kind of place you normally see a helicopter landing so I went round to have a look. ""One guy, who I assume was the pilot, was soaked to the skin but he was standing up and talking on the phone so he looked OK. ""We're used to seeing planes fly over but not like that."" A Sussex Police spokesman said: ""Two people are reported to have escaped from the aircraft, believed to be a Cessna. ""They swam ashore after the plane came down quite close to the beach and are thought to be uninjured at this time."" The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: ""The UK Coastguard received multiple 999 calls at approximately 3.50pm today reporting that a small plane with two people on board had ditched into the water off Shoreham. ""The Shoreham Coastguard Rescue Team and RNLI lifeboat were immediately tasked, along with the coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Lee-on-Solent. ""Thankfully both individuals are now ashore safe and well and in the care of Sussex Police and the South East Ambulance Service."" The RNLI confirmed on Twitter that a lifeboat had been launched but that there were no casualties. Shoreham is home to Brighton City Airport, used by many light aircraft and flying schools."
2017-03-31,The first day after the trigger is pulled and already there is returning fire. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/eu-fires-back-after-theresa-may-pulls-brexit-trigger-10818385,"The British Government has received salvos from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande over how the negotiations should be conducted. Both have rejected one of Theresa May's key demands, which is to settle the terms of the UK's departure at the same time as agreeing future trading arrangements. It's an unsettling start to the process and could lead to delay. First it was Mrs Merkel, speaking in Berlin yesterday. She said: ""The negotiations must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship."" Trade could only be discussed afterwards. Then this morning Mr Hollande told the PM during a phone conversation that he also thought the terms of withdrawal should come first. Settle that, then discuss future trading deals. This doesn't work for the UK. It's clear the PM doesn't want to pay up her divorce bill without knowing how much access she will have to the kids. But who is right on this and who is likely to get their way? So far the Government hasn't budged. The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said this morning on Sky News: ""We've got to debate this"" as he defended the Government's view that talks over the UK's departure should run in parallel with future trade negotiations."" He insists that Mrs Merkel doesn't have the final word, saying: ""It's a negotiation and we want to do it in a certain way."" The Brexit Secretary believes it is the Commission rather than the member states that has been pushing to complete the departure bill first and the trade deal second. But he adds: ""Article 50 says the departure should be negotiated taking into account the ongoing deal."" ""It makes it pretty plain they've got to be done together. ""We think that's a smart way to do it, because everybody then can make a judgement as to what's a good outcome for everybody - what the balance of outcomes are."" He is right that this is specified in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. It states that if a country chooses to leave, ""the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union"". This is open to interpretation, however. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the European Parliament's Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, told Adam Boulton's All Out Politics on Sky News: ""The treaty is very clear about this. ""In Article 50 it's stipulated that first of all you do the withdrawal agreement in the light of your future relationship between the UK and the EU."" So Mrs Merkel's view seems to have growing support, whereas this morning, when asked by Sky News, the PM's spokesman was unwilling or unable to name any leaders who supported Mrs May on this. In some ways, Mrs Merkel's position on dismissing the idea of parallel negotiations is strengthened by Mrs May's approach to Brexit. In her Lancaster House speech in January, the PM was explicit that the UK wanted a clean break from the EU, saying she did ""not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave"". It is therefore quite easy for the Europeans to offer the UK the clean break it wants - settling assets and liabilities, paying off the divorce bill and then saying only afterwards we should look at the future trading relationship. If the UK had begun with an approach that it might want to retain some aspects of EU membership, this would have made it much more difficult to split the negotiations into two parts. It could however argue that there will still be aspects of shared interests, such as ongoing investment in scientific research, and that these things need to be settled and agreed upon before the divorce bill can be known. When Sky News asked Number 10 whether the divorce bill was a negotiating chip for a possible future trading deal with the EU, the PM's spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment on negotiation strategy. It seems the negotiation over the negotiation could drag on and certainly it is unlikely to be settled until after the Council of Europe meets on 29 April. Here ministers will decide the guidelines for negotiations. Mr Davis says ""that's the point at which we should start saying 'OK, we agree here, we disagree there'"". But it's a worry that in the first battle of this negotiation, the EU's biggest players are so openly opposed to the UK's planned approach."

He escaped the death penalty by entering into a plea deal and had been serving an 80-year minimum sentence. His first parole hearing was due in 2043. The 64-year-old was found beaten in his Toledo prison cell two days ago and authorities have now confirmed his death. Working as a nurse's assistant, Harvey said he had killed his victims to end their suffering as many were chronically ill. He used arsenic and cyanide to poison most of them, often slipping it into food. Others died when he let their oxygen tanks run out. Harvey was caught when a medical examiner smelled arsenic during a post-mortem. After being convicted, he claimed his was behind another 18 patient deaths at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Cincinnati. He told a newspaper that he liked having control of who lived and who died. Former Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur Ney Jr, who took charge of the cases in Cincinnati, said Harvey was not a mercy killer. ""He killed because he liked to kill,"" Mr Ney said."

Giving a rare interview to German TV station ProSieben, he said his children have now been alive for longer than they knew their mother. In the interview, reported by German newspaper Bild, he described how just one hour after finding her body he had to focus on giving the two boys their lunch. He said: ""In retrospect, I think she thought the children would close the gap. But that just does not work. ""Heroin is a drug that makes you feel something better than life. This is the terrible thing: you are feeding your body with something that will kill you. ""When I found her, I was not surprised. I thought to myself at that moment 'yes of course - you had to do that'. ""What I remember, it must have been an hour after I found her, that it's time for the kids' lunch. They needed their lunch. ""So I took the children's chairs to the table, took the yoghurts out of the fridge, the bananas."" Mr Cohen, former frontman for the band S.C.U.M, told the newspaper he shows his children pictures of Peaches every few weeks so they won't forget her. He said the routine of looking after the two boys has helped him deal with his grief, and said he knows learning about their mother's death will be hard for the children when they are teenagers. He added: ""There is always hope, even in the greatest grief. You must not let yourself be eaten by grief or transfer it to your children. ""It takes a while, but now we can look forward."" Peaches' mother, Paula Yates, also died from a heroin overdose in 2000 aged 41."

Mr Osborne has been sharply criticised over accepting the role at the Evening Standard, which he adds to his numerous other jobs - including MP for Tatton. Shortly after his appointment, it emerged that the former Chancellor failed to wait for approval from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments before taking on his new job - a breach of the ministerial code. The committee is investigating the issue. The Prime Minister has been urged to strip Mr Osborne of the Conservative whip because of his newspaper job on the grounds it is a conflict of interest. :: George Osborne has HOW many jobs? Labour has said it was ""intolerable"" for the operation of a free press that a newspaper editor should be a sitting MP. Under 2009 guidelines, additional employment is allowed but within ""reasonable limits"", however, second jobs have increasingly caused concern. Committee on Standards in Public Life chairman Lord Bew said the review had been under consideration for some time and was not solely sparked by Mr Osborne's new role. He said: ""While it is for others to consider individual cases, the committee wants to look at the current compromise which does not ban MPs holding outside interests, providing they are within 'reasonable limits' and that there is transparency about them. ""We welcome views from the public and any interested parties on these issues. For example, what factors should be taken into account in determining the 'reasonable limits' on MPs' outside interests and is the current level of transparency sufficient?"" :: Just why has Tony Blair backed Osborne over his Standard job? The findings of the review will be reported to the House of Commons Committee on Standards' review of the Code of Conduct for MPs in June. Mr Osborne, who is due to take up his newspaper job on May 2, also earns £640,000 a year for one day a week's work as an advisor at fund manager BlackRock. In the last year he has made £800,000 from 15 speaking engagements, including at City and Wall Street banks. He also receives a £120,212 allowance as Kissinger fellow at the McCain Institute for a year and has an unpaid role as the chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. Critics claim all posts create conflict of interest with his role as MP, while others suggest he cannot possibly fulfil his pledge to constituents while he's so busy with his other jobs. However, he has received the backing of his local Conservative association."

The coordinated raids, carried out in the Netherlands, UK, Germany, Australia and France on Thursday, followed consultations with national governments. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) confirmed it was involved in the UK side of the operation which was focused, it said, on senior officials and customers of a ""global financial institution"". A spokeswoman for Dutch prosecutors said millions of euros worth of goods including paintings, gold bars, cash and other assets were seized in swoops on addresses linked to 3,800 Dutch accounts. They made two arrests at homes in The Hague and Hoofddorp. The country's office for financial crimes prosecution (FIOD) said dozens of people were suspected of involvement in alleged fraud and money laundering through their use of bank accounts, with assets not disclosed to tax authorities. HMRC told Sky News: ""Yesterday HMRC, working with our international partners, launched a criminal investigation into suspected tax evasion and money laundering by a global financial institution and certain of its employees. ""The first phase of the investigation, which will see further, targeted, activity over the coming weeks, is focused on senior employees from within the institution, along with a number of its customers. ""The international reach of this investigation sends a clear message that there is no hiding place for those seeking to evade tax. ""Promoters and facilitators of tax evasion schemes, and their customers, need to wake up to reality and accept that attempting to hide wealth overseas, or within institutions, doesn't work and doesn't place them out of our reach."" The bank's statement read: ""On 30 March 2017, Credit Suisse offices in London, Paris and Amsterdam were contacted by local authorities concerning client tax matters. We are cooperating with the authorities. ""Since 2013, Credit Suisse applies the Withholding Tax Agreement between Switzerland and the UK.

2017-03-31,The driver of the Glasgow bin lorry that killed six people has avoided going to prison after admitting culpable and reckless driving just nine months after the tragedy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/glasgow-bin-lorry-driver-harry-clarke-avoids-jail-for-reckless-driving-10819155,"Harry Clarke admitted driving a car in Glasgow on 20 September 2015 to the danger of the public, despite his licence having been revoked for medical reasons. The 60-year-old has also been given a 12-month supervision order and will have to wear an electronic tag and carry out 150 hours' unpaid work. Senior Fiscal Depute Martin Allan told Glasgow Sheriff Court that a neighbour spotted Clarke driving out of the car park of his home in the Baillieston area of Glasgow and called the police. ""Both were suspicious about his ability to drive because of the media coverage and they did some research online and found that his licence had been revoked on medical grounds. They called the police at 8.04pm. ""While waiting for the police between 10.15pm and 10.20pm, they saw his car return again to the car park and it parked up in the usual space. ""He got out and went to the boot to get carrier bags."" Police went to Clarke's home on September 22 and he was cautioned and charged. The court heard that he told police: ""I have never been out on a public road, I've just moved the car in the private car park."" Ross Yuill, defending Clarke, said his client drove from the car park of his block of flats through a tunnel onto Buchanan Street and parked near the main entrance to the building so that he could unload some heavy items. He said Mr Clarke drove around 30 yards on the public road, and added ""he wholly accepts that that decision was a gross error of judgment."" Sheriff Martin Jones QC told Clarke he passed the ""custody threshold"" but that he was legally prevented from jailing him because he was a first offender. He said that following the bin lorry crash Clarke was diagnosed with a medical condition that sometimes resulted in temporary loss of consciousness. He said: ""The history you provided suggested that you had no prior warning before the episode of December 2014 which made it very difficult to predict whether the episodes will ever recur."" Six people died and another 15 were injured in December 2014 when Clarke lost control of his refuse lorry in the city centre. He was not prosecuted over the crash after the Crown Office said there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal proceedings. Jack and Lorraine Sweeney, 68 and 69, and their granddaughter Erin McQuade, 18, Stephenie Tait, 29, Jacqueline Morton, 51, and Gillian Ewing, 52, died. A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) heard Clarke had history of health issues but did not tell his employers or the DVLA about his medical background."

Around 62% of Scottish voters supported the UK remaining part of the EU in last year's Brexit vote. :: In full: Sturgeon's referendum letter to May The Scottish National Party's manifesto for last year's Holyrood elections pledged to seek another independence ballot if there was a ""material change in circumstances"" from the 2014 referendum. The First Minister said in her letter: ""In these very changed circumstances, the people of Scotland must have the right to choose our own future - in short, to exercise our right of self determination. ""Far from securing a UK wide approach ahead of invoking Article 50 - as you committed to do last July - the voices of the devolved administrations were largely ignored and all attempts at compromise rejected, in most cases with no prior consultation. ""There appears to be no rational reason for you to stand in the way of the will of the Scottish Parliament and I hope you will not do so."" Ms Sturgeon urged Mrs May to make a start on transferring the power to have a referendum. She said time would be tight if the process for holding it was to be squeezed into her preferred timetable of 18 months. The UK Government has said it will decline the request, with Mrs May consistently insisting that ""now is not the time"" for a second independence referendum. But Ms Sturgeon asserted the will of the Scottish Parliament ""must be respected and progressed"". :: Sturgeon unconvinced by PM's talk of extra devolution post-Brexit ""The question is not if, but how,"" she insisted. ""I hope that will be by constructive discussion between our governments. However, if that is not yet possible, I will set out to the Scottish Parliament the steps I intend to take to ensure that progress is made towards a referendum."" Whilst Scottish Government officials drafted several versions of the letter for their First Minister, Ms Sturgeon crafted the final version herself inside her private study on the upper floors of her official Bute House residence in Edinburgh. She tweeted a picture of herself writing the letter while sat casually on a sofa. A hard copy of the letter was sent to Downing Street, along with an emailed version. Mrs May and Ms Sturgeon met earlier this week in Glasgow as the First Minister continued to press her case for another referendum. Ms Sturgeon described it as ""reasonably cordial"" and said her hope for another vote in 18 months to two years' time was realistic because the PM had told her the terms of a Brexit deal should be clear by then. However, in a speech before the meeting, Mrs May hailed the United Kingdom as an ""unstoppable force"". The PM is sticking to her belief that a vote in the next two years would be ""unfair"" on people in Scotland because not all the terms about life outside EU will be finalised. Responding to Ms Sturgeon's letter, Downing Street reiterated the PM's stance on the matter and said the UK Government ""will not be entering into negotiations on the Scottish Government's proposal"". ""We have been joined together as one country for more than 300 years. We've worked together, we've prospered together, we've fought wars together, and we have a bright future. At this crucial time we should be working together, not pulling apart."""
2017-03-31,"So that's it. The talking is over. Now, Britain is formally leaving the EU.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/there-will-be-a-wait-to-see-what-happens-after-a-40-year-relationship-ends-10817129,"The more you think about it, the more significant this moment is. For four decades, Britain's social and economic foundations have become more and more tightly integrated with the rest of Europe. More than one in ten of all the laws passed in recent decades came from Europe. Now that process will abruptly go into reverse. The economic implications of this process are incredibly far-reaching: now that Britain can forge its own way, will it transform its economic model? Will the process of leaving the EU damage the economy? Will all those predictions about a weaker economy and poorer household incomes come true? :: Half of Britons happy Brexit talks starting Tempting as it is to assume that once Article 50 is out of the way, we will finally get answers to these questions, I wouldn't be so sure. In fact, the chances are the next few months will look rather similar to the last ones: we will still see lots of political noise as both the UK and the EU lay out their negotiating positions. It will be hard, for some time, to get a sense of where things will end up (that is what happens with negotiations). :: Tick-tock: It's the Sky Brexit Countdown And, in the absence of a sudden change of tack from either side, markets are likely to carry on what they've been doing since the dust cleared after the referendum: to tick over, until more clarity emerges about the eventual deal Britain will get. Indeed, the parameters of the negotiations have been clear for some time: before any talks about the trade deal Britain could secure with Europe, some other things will have to be cleared up. :: Brexit timetable: Guide to the next two years Among these are: the divorce proceedings themselves; the question of a cash settlement between the UK and Europe; and the question of what happens to EU assets and, crucially, to EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU. There are big question marks over the land border in Northern Ireland. So, for all the excitement over the Article 50 letter itself, the fundamentals are unlikely to shift in the coming days. :: Twenty big Brexit questions answered Instead we will hear a lot about process. We will hear about how the EU intends to respond, about how open they plan to be about their negotiating position, about the business to be discussed in the next summit in late April. There will be some discussion over whether the UK can start discussions about future ties while also negotiating the divorce (Britain wants to, the EU is apparently reluctant). :: Disunited Kingdom: Has Brexit divided the UK? Such things are incredibly exciting to policy wonks but of less significance to normal human beings. For most of us, what matters is that the economy has not fallen off a cliff in the wake of the Brexit vote, and is unlikely to fall off another one this week. However, it is worth noting that the relatively robust economic growth has started to tail off in recent months. Britain evaded a recession, but much of the consumer spending that fuelled growth in the second half of last year seems to be tailing off. :: Article 50 letter will set mood for negotiations Business investment is weak (as companies tread water to a degree as they try to work out the impact of Brexit). Inflation is rising and wage inflation is staying put. Probably, real wages are already falling. In other words, the economic backdrop is likely to look a lot less rosy over the coming year or so. Not a crisis, but not the feelgood factor. :: Brexit talks: How team UK and team EU line up That is somewhat inevitable. Until businesses and households have more sense of the eventual destination, they are quite rational to cut back on spending. The bad news is that Article 50 and the Great Repeal Bill, which has its White Paper tabled tomorrow, are likely to leave the big questions unanswered. We will need to be more patient. You can't wind up a 40-year relationship overnight."

Her husband Jared Kushner is already an unpaid but official senior adviser to the US President. In a statement Ms Trump said she would be subject to all the rules as other federal employees. She said: ""I have heard the concerns some have with my advising the president in my personal capacity while voluntarily complying with all ethics rules and I will instead serve as an unpaid employee in the White House office, subject to all of the same rules as other federal employees."" It is not clear what impact, if any, her new role will have on her self-titled clothing business. Her father agreed, as past presidents had done, to put his business interests into a trust for the period while he is commander-in-chief, but the arrangement is not a blind trust as many had called for. Questions about possible conflicts of interest that could arise as a result of Ivanka Trump's work followed an announcement on 20 March the 35-year-old would become an informal adviser to her father, with an office in the West Wing. Ethics experts said it would allow her to avoid some of the rules and disclosures that other federal employees were subject to. There were already concerns she was attending a number of top level meetings with her father despite not being an official part of the White House staff. A spokesman for the President said: ""We are pleased that Ivanka Trump has chosen to take this step in her unprecedented role as first daughter and in support of the president. ""Ivanka's service as an unpaid employee furthers our commitment to ethics, transparency, and compliance and affords her increased opportunities to lead initiatives driving real policy benefits for the American public that would not have been available to her previously."" In taking the official role she sidesteps further criticism at a time when her father's ratings are at an all-time low, following a series of policy difficulties. His average rating, according to RealClear Politics, has fallen to -11.5, with 52.9% of those polled disapproving of his actions, to 41.4% approving."
2017-03-31,"Charging for disposable coffee cups could help cut their use by up to 300 million a year, new research suggests.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/charged-urged-for-coffee-cups-to-reduce-waste-10818076,"It is estimated that coffee lovers in the UK get through 2.5 billion disposable cups every twelve months - translating into about 25,000 tonnes of waste. But only about one in 400 is recycled. That is because they are made from plastic wrapped in paper - and the mixed material makes them hard to recycle. :: Sky Ocean Rescue: How to get involved To make them waterproof, the card is fused with polyethylene - a material that cannot be separated out again in a standard recycling mill. There are only two sites in the UK where the film is separated from the plastic. Academics from Cardiff University tested a series of ideas to encourage consumers to use re-usable cups. In addition to the charge, there were messages reminding people about the environmental impact of single use cups, while free re-usable cups were made available. In one cafe, the three measures combined increased the use of re-usable cups from from 5.1% to 17.4%. Professor Wouter Poortinga, who wrote the report, said that while the measures only had a ""modest"" impact when used alone, ""the greatest behavioural change was when the measures were combined"". He added: ""Our results show that, on average, the use of reusable coffee cups could be increased by up to 12.5% with a combination of measures. ""With this in mind, the UK's usage of an estimated 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups each year could be cut by up to 300 million coffee cups."" But while a charge on disposable cups had an impact, a discount on re-usable cups did not. ""People are far more sensitive to losses than to gains when making decisions,"" Professor Poortinga said. ""So if we really want to change a customer's behaviour then a charge on a disposable cup is more likely to be effective."" But the British Coffee Association disagreed with that approach. Its executive director, Chris Stemman, told Sky News: ""We believe that developing new packaging materials and enhancing recycling processes and infrastructures will have a significantly greater and longer-term impact compared with other proposed measures such as charging or taxing disposable cups."" The 5p charge for a plastic bag has had a dramatic effect - cutting their use by 85%. Andrew Pendleton from Friends of the Earth said: ""Preferably, non-recyclable paper cups should just be banned outright so that consumers can go into a cafe and simply be served with a cup that can be recycled. ""We have seen the great environmental benefits that a small charge on carrier bags has made, so we know measures like this are proven to work, and are therefore a progressive step in the right direction."""
2017-03-31,A mother and her 13-year-old son have died after being stabbed at their home in Stourbridge in the West Midlands.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/stourbridge-killings-mother-and-son-die-after-being-stabbed-at-home-10818196,"The woman, in her 50s, who has been named by Sky sources as Tracey Wilkinson, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her teenage son, named as Pierce Wilkinson, was found in cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at Birmingham Children's Hospital. The woman's husband, Peter Wilkinson, remains in hospital in a serious condition with stab wounds to his chest and back after all three were attacked at the property in Greyhound Lane. Their daughter, Lydia, is away from home at university. A man in his 20s was arrested in nearby Norton Road after a vehicle was ""intercepted"" and apparently crashed about 30 minutes after the victims were found. Superintendent Lee Kendrick said: ""What has unfolded here this morning is horrific and heartbreaking. ""Police and ambulance were confronted with an awful scene: a man, woman and boy all with very serious stab injuries."" Detectives said nothing could be done to save the woman and she was pronounced dead at the scene. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called to the property just after 8am and discovered the woman and the teenager inside the house and the husband in the garden. Two air ambulances were also called out. The man was arrested after a Land Rover Discovery, stolen from outside the home, crashed nearby. Police said officers had ""intercepted"" the car and pictures appear to show it had hit a wall. The suspect, whom West Midlands Police say was known to them, will be questioned on suspicion of murder and wounding. ""Clearly our investigation is at a very early stage but we understand the suspect was known to the family and may have been living at the address - although he is not a family relative,"" Superintendent Lee Kendrick said. ""We don't think this was a burglary or a robbery. ""Our investigation is progressing at pace and we are working to understand exactly what the relationship was between the man and the family. ""At this stage we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident."" Flowers have been left at the scene. One message read: ""RIP Tracey."""

Previously, the warmest day this month had been the 19.9C reported in Aviemore in the Scottish Highlands on Sunday.

2017-03-31,"Five people who died in a helicopter crash in Snowdonia were all from the same family, police have confirmed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170331140730/http://news.sky.com/story/family-of-five-from-milton-keynes-killed-in-snowdonia-helicopter-crash-10818272,"The wreckage of a helicopter and five bodies were found in the Rhinog mountains near Trawsfynydd on Thursday. Police said the victims were all adults and from the Milton Keynes area. Feared to be among the dead are Kevin and Ruth Burke, from Hulcote near Milton Keynes, who are understood to be the directors of Staske Construction Ltd in Bletchley. The couple are also the registered owners of a Twin Squirrel helicopter, the same model as that which disappeared from radar contact while flying over Caernarfon Bay on Wednesday afternoon. Mrs Burke is believed to be originally from Dublin, the helicopter's intended destination. Mr Burke, who is reported to be from Manchester, is a former Hulcote and Salford parish councillor and a qualified pilot. A neighbour of the couple, Elizabeth Thornley, said they had not lived in their home in Hulcote long, and had been ""doing up the house for about a year-and-a-half"". Mr and Mrs Burke are believed to have a 14-year-old son and a 19-year-old daughter. Formal identification of those on board the helicopter is yet to take place, but their families are being supported by police family liaison officers. North Wales Police did not immediately reveal the precise location the helicopter was found, in order ""to allow a dignified and unhindered recovery of the bodies"". Adverse weather conditions are understood to be impeding the operation, with the terrain ""described as very difficult and challenging"". A full sea and land search rescue operation was launched after the aircraft failed to arrive in Dublin from Luton on Wednesday afternoon. A temporary exclusion zone over the crash site with a height of 5,500 ft above sea level and a five nautical mile radius is currently in place. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch will lead an investigation. Airbus Helicopters - the manufacturers of the Twin Squirrel, a popular utility helicopter used by police forces and private charter companies - have said they are ""standing by to provide support"". Introduced in the mid-1970s, the model is said to need little maintenance and has a reputation for durability. Anyone who may have seen the helicopter flying over Snowdonia is asked to call police on 101."
