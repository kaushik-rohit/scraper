2017-07-01,"Mel B splurged her multimillion pound Spice Girls fortune after leading an ""extravagant and affluent"" lifestyle, a court has heard. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/mel-b-blew-multimillion-spice-girls-fortune-on-extravagant-lifestyle-10933063,"The 42-year-old, real name Melanie Brown, and her estranged husband Stephen Belafonte racked up tax debts in the US after making ""improvident"" financial decisions, Los Angeles Superior Court was told. During a hearing in the couple's divorce case, the pair were said to ""never have money at the end of the year to pay their taxes"". Grace Jamra, representing Belafonte, said that while the couple led an ""extravagant and affluent"" lifestyle, Brown ""wiped out all her Spice Girls money - approximately $50m (£38.3m) if not more"". Meanwhile, Jacalyn Davis, representing Brown, said the pair's joint income ""was being spent and then some"". ""In this marriage that would be Miss Brown's income from the Spice Girls,"" she said. ""Prickly things happen when the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) doesn't get paid."" Brown claims Belafonte subjected her to years of physical and mental abuse. Belafonte has ""vehemently"" denied he had subjected her to abuse. Brown previously won a temporary restraining order after alleging her husband was abusive and had links to the porn industry. Her lawyers claimed he was a danger to their child as a ""convicted domestic violence offender"" with an ""extensive criminal history"". However, Ms Jamra argued the allegations were part of ""an ongoing smear campaign"". Judge Lawrence Riff ruled that Belafonte, 42, could only see their five-year-old daughter Madison twice a week at a supervised centre. Brown, who is now a judge on America's Got Talent, married the film producer in June 2007. She filed for divorce on March 20, citing ""irreconcilable differences"". The case continues."
2017-07-01,"Health campaigners say the 10th anniversary of the smoking ban marks a ""decade of success"", with smoking rates now the lowest ever recorded.  ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/anniversary-of-uk-smoking-ban-marks-a-decade-of-success-10933120,"Laws banning smoking in pubs, clubs, bars and other enclosed public places in England came into effect on 1 July 2007, following Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. According to Cancer Research UK, there are now 1.9 million fewer smokers in Britain - with the proportion of 16 to 24-year-olds lighting up falling from 26% to a record low of 17%. The proportion of the population that are regular smokers has also dropped from 20.9% to 16.1%. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of anti-smoking group Ash, told Sky News the figures capped off a ""decade of success"". She said: ""We had 10 million smokers 10 years ago and now it's around two million fewer. ""That's helped to stop it being a public health emergency. ""It's the leading cause of preventable death. It kills more people than obesity, alcohol and illegal drugs put together."" Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar welcomed ""big changes in public attitudes towards smoking"", but called on the Government to do more to reduce smoking rates. He said: ""The job is far from done when we still have more than eight million smokers in Britain and tens of thousands of children taking up the deadly addiction every year. ""We need this Government to continue focusing on tobacco and we urge it to publish the Tobacco Control Plan for England as soon as possible."" While health campaigners welcomed the ban, not everyone is happy about all aspects of the legislation. Pro-smoking lobby group Forest claims that more than 11,000 pubs in England alone have gone out of business, partly due to the ban. Meanwhile, Spiked magazine assistant editor Ella Whelan said the legislation represented too much state interference. She told Sky News: ""We've gone wildly too far in enacting bans and regulations on how people should conduct their private lives. ""The smoking ban, I think, is starting to become a real snowball effect into intervention into private life."""
2017-07-01,An oil tanker and a bulk carrier have smashed into each other in the English Channel.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/petrol-tanker-and-bulk-carrier-in-major-collision-in-english-channel-10933278,"The RNLI, which sent lifeboats to the scene, has described the crash as a ""major collision"". Britain's coastguard received a call shortly after 2am this morning, reporting the incident in the narrow Dover Strait - the world's busiest shipping lane. The Hong Kong-registered 600ft tanker, the Seafrontier, was carrying 37,953 metric tonnes of petrol and had 27 people on board. It was heading to Puerto Barrios in Guatemala. The 75,000-ton 738ft bulk carrier, Huayang Endeavour, also registered in Hong Kong, was en route to Lagos Nigeria. Carrying only ballast, it had a crew of 22. Both vessels were at a complete stop, the RNLI said. The Seafrontier was reported to have a gash in the hull above the waterline and damage to the superstructure. The second vessel is also reported to have been damaged in the crash, but neither are thought to be taking on water and there was no pollution. According to the RNLI, no one was hurt in the collision and no one has been reported missing. Dover and Ramsgate RNLI lifeboats were sent to the scene, along with a coastguard helicopter - they have all since returned to base. A French tug from Boulogne is on the scene and expected to tow the Seafrontier. With sea conditions calm, the coastguard was continuing to monitor the situation."

The print journalist turned presenter was the face of the BBC's Film from 1972 to 1998, becoming the show's longest running host before moving to Sky TV. He also wrote for the Daily Mail as a ""gossip journalist"" before moving to the Guardian as a columnist. ""For three decades he was the guy who told you what to watch and what not to watch,"" his literary agent, Gordon Wise, told Sky News. ""He also brought an extraordinary understanding of how a film was made,"" he added. ""You'll remember those little, mini documentaries he'd make, talking to the incredible directors and seeing the stars at work rather than just being celebrities. ""He brought a whole new understanding of film, I think, to at least two generations."" Very sad to hear that Barry Norman has left us. A great critic and a lovely, lovely man. Norman's laid back interviewing style and the way he downplayed Hollywood stardom became a trademark of his show, with the presenter famously spatting with several A-listers. His most famous riff was with actor Robert De Niro, whom the presenter got ""nose to nose"" with after an interview. ""Well, I was never going to try and punch him,"" Norman later recalled in an interview. ""Come on, I may look stupid but I'm not really. He was a lot younger than me and a lot fitter than me,"" he added. The issue was around De Niro's rumoured attempt to play Tom Hanks' part in the 1988 comedy Big. Norman asked De Niro if it was true he had ""begged"" for the part, and the Raging Bull actor took it personally. ""There was a moment there when I thought he might hang one on me,"" Norman said. ""I was not looking forward to that moment."" There was also the time he confronted Bruce Willis with the fact that his sci-fi drama Armaggedon was laughed off at Cannes, or the time he told Mel Gibson he was not nearly as tall as he was. Western film star John Wayne called Norman a ""goddamn pinko liberal"" after the two disagreed on the Vietnam War. Sad to hear of Barry Norman’s departure. A film critic and a provider of fine pickled onions. That’s a good life https://t.co/g1fpNIkB0H Away from his legendary career, the film critic was also a proud husband and family man. He was married to journalist and author Diana Norman - who wrote a series of best-selling historical thrillers under the name Ariana Franklin - for 54 years, until her death in 2011. ""I was working as a gossip writer on the Daily Sketch for my sins, which was the only job I could get, and she was working as a very highly respected writer on the Daily Herald, as it was then,"" he recalled. ""We met in Fleet Street and married."" There was also a famous rumour surrounding Norman's supposed crush on actress Michelle Pfeiffer. ""It was generally believed I was madly in love with Michelle Pfeiffer,"" he told the Guardian. ""I wasn't. Although I did like her very much. I do think she's beautiful."" Norman said he was never rich, having left TV ""before they gave out the monopoly money"", and earning more from his famous ""Premium Pickled Onions"" business."
2017-07-01,Sir Martin Moore-Bick has been appointed as the head of the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/who-is-sir-martin-moore-bick-the-top-judge-leading-the-grenfell-inquiry-10930893,"He said the inquiry will be ""open, transparent and fair"" and one that ""gets to the truth as quickly as possible"". The retired Court of Appeal judge has held many high-profile roles over a career spanning five decades Born in December 1946 and educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, he was called to the bar in 1969. Sir Martin began his legal career specialising in commercial contracts and went on to be appointed Queen's Counsel in 1986. He sat as a Deputy High Court judge before he was appointed to the High Court in October 1995. The father-of-four had served in the Commercial Court of the High Court before he joined the Court of Appeal in April 2005. There, he was an adviser to two Lord Chancellors: Lord Falconer and Jack Straw. Sir Martin has handled prominent cases in the past - one of which saw him rule on a challenge brought by the family of Mark Duggan over police procedures following fatal shootings by officers. He also ruled on the case of a council looking to rehouse a mother-of-five 50 miles away from her current property because a cap on benefits had made her London flat unaffordable. Although Sir Martin allowed Westminster City Council to rehouse Titina Nzolameso near Milton Keynes, his decision was later overturned by the Supreme Court. He most recently held the title of Lord Justice of Appeal, retiring last December. The Prime Minister has said a full judge-led inquiry is needed to ensure the blaze at the 24-storey block in west London, which killed at least 80 people, is ""properly investigated"". Theresa May has also insisted that residents will be given a say over the direction of the investigation."

""The last two nights at Wembley have been the biggest and best shows of my life. ""To come home to such a response after so long away doing something I never thought I could pull off but did has blown me away. ""However, I've struggled vocally on both nights. I had to push a lot harder than I normally do."" The Hello singer said she went to see a throat doctor on Friday night, who advised her not to perform over the weekend. She said: ""I'm already maxed out on steroids and aids for my voice. ""I've considered doing Saturday night's show but it's highly unlikely I'd even make it though the set and I simply can't crumble in front of you all and walk out on you in that way."" The star said she did not take the decision lightly, adding: ""To not complete this milestone in my career is something I'm struggling to get my head around and I wish that I wasn't having to write this. ""It's something I'm really struggling to come to terms with. It's as if my whole career has been building up to these four shows."" Adele had already performed two nights to crowds of around 98,000 fans on Wednesday and Thursday night and tickets for her Saturday and Sunday shows were also due to be before capacity crowds. She said refunds would be available to fans if shows cannot be rescheduled, signing off with: ""I'm sorry, I'm devastated. ""I'm sorry. I love you. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me x."""

Mr Hett was a 'superfan' of the soap - he even had a tattoo of Weatherfield stalwart Deirdre Barlow on his leg. Stars from the show Helen Worth, Jennie McAlpine, Kym Marsh, Antony Cotton and Faye Brookes and producer Kate Oates attended the service. His decorated coffin was taken to Stockport Town Hall for the service in a white carriage pulled by grey horses wearing white feathers. The service, attended by around 600 people, had to be streamed on a large screen outside the hall for those unable to get in. It was all planned according to Mr Hett's wishes - with everyone being told to wear something ""black and fabulous"". The song Beautiful by Mariah Carey, who Mr Hett was a huge fan of, played as his coffin entered the town hall. Carey even sent a video message in which she said she knew Mr Hett ""was shining down on us from heaven"". She said she was ""so happy"" to have met Mr Hett and that she was ""honoured to have played a strong role in his life"". Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus welcomed mourners, saying Mr Hett ""was just so lovely and made such an impact on my life"". The Scottish singer first met Mr Hett on social media and she said she would ""never forget"" him. He once spent more than 24 hours on a coach to travel to see her in concert. Video messages from Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw and comedian Jason Manford were also played at the service Grimshaw, who met Mr Hett on Twitter, called him ""a genuine inspiration on how to live your life"". Manford said ""the world had been robbed of a potential superstar"" and said that Mr Hett had touched many people's lives. Mr Hett had been a popular figure on social media and the hashtag #bemoremartyn was trending on Twitter after his funeral started and later into the day. Mr Hett's dad Paul gave a tribute to his son, saying: ""I would describe Martyn's life as one long rollercoaster ride. You never knew where it would take you or what was round that corner, but you couldn't wait for it to happen. ""He was inspirational and this in turn inspired everyone around him. ""His comic timing was perfect. He would have gone on to achieve the most amazing things, of that we have no doubt. ""In a very nice way, Martyn loved being in the limelight and the centre of attention. He would be loving every minute of this fantastic celebration of his life."" Mr Hett was one of 22 victims killed when a terrorist bombed Manchester Arena at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. At the funeral, Mr Hett's stepfather, Stuart Murray, read a letter written by a stranger who saw Mr Hett at the concert and described him entertaining the stands by dancing to a Beyonce song as they waited for the show to start. Grande's song One Last Time - the final song played at the concert before the attack - was played as Mr Hett's coffin was carried out of the hall."
2017-07-01,"There are calls for towns and cities across the UK to install water fountains, in a bid to crack down on the millions of plastic bottles making their way into our rivers and oceans every year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/bid-to-bring-back-water-fountains-to-cut-down-on-plastic-waste-10933966,"London's first public drinking fountain was built into the railings of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate Church in 1859 by the Quaker Samuel Gurney. Thousands of people turned out in Holborn to see it being unveiled. Historian Emma Jones told Sky News: ""Samuel Gurney was a philanthropist and he was really interested in temperance. He really wanted to keep people away from the public house. So providing free water was obviously one of the ways they thought they could achieve that."" Whilst in the nineteenth century, drinking fountains were introduced to wean people off alcohol, nowadays, it's hoped they could help to wean people off bottled water instead. Since it was introduced in the 1980s water fountains have undoubtedly declined in popularity, as people are increasingly buying single use plastic bottles. Ms Jones said: ""We've had a real growth in the bottled water market. There was a real fitness culture - aerobics, we had Jane Fonda's workout, selling masses of copies in 1982 and people wanted to be lycra-clad and swigging bottles of water and getting the body beautiful."" In Bristol the water fountain is now making a comeback. The environmental research centre, Eumonia, has installed and sponsored a fountain in the city centre and is calling on other businesses to do the same. Consultant Adrian Gibbs told Sky News: ""Drinking fountains encourage us to keep healthy and stay hydrated, they cut down on primary resources to reduce plastics and also emissions involved in creating plastic bottles, and by avoiding the use of disposable plastic packaging we avoid litter, which gets into our streams and oceans."" Bristol is now a refillable city, meaning hundreds of bars and cafes allow people to fill up their water bottles for free. There's even a Refill app, which originated in Bristol, but now has a following all over the world. Natalie Fee, who set up the initiative, said: ""Refill is all about helping people appreciate tap water and to help people realise that they don't have to buy single use plastic bottles when they're out and about. The UK is only recycling half of its plastics and a lot of those are escaping into waterways and seas."" Almost 36 million plastic bottles are bought in the UK every day. Less than half are recycled and some can take 450 years to break down when they get into our oceans. It's hoped that encouraging people to once again use drinking fountains, rather than buying bottled water, will help to curb the problem. Sky News launched its Sky Ocean Rescue campaign earlier this year aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the world's seas. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"
2017-07-01,"A former top aide to David Davis has suggested the Brexit Secretary wants Theresa May to scrap her ""red lines"" on Britain's EU exit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/david-davis-and-boris-johnson-want-pm-to-loosen-brexit-stance-10933021,"Despite her General Election disaster, the Prime Minister has stuck to her Brexit plan's hardline stance on leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and gaining full control over immigration. But it has been claimed two of the most senior members of her Cabinet want Mrs May to soften her position because it is making Brexit negotiations ""very difficult"". James Chapman, Mr Davis' chief of staff until the General Election, described how both his former boss and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson might be keen for the Prime Minister to rethink her Brexit vision. Where Mrs May has taken ""absolutist positions on particular issues"", such as the ECJ, Mr Chapman said the Prime Minister had ""hamstrung"" the UK in exit talks with the EU. He suggested Mrs May had ""set a red line"" on the ECJ for the purposes of her Tory party conference speech last year. Mr Chapman insisted ""there isn't anyone better"" in Parliament than Mr Davis to negotiate Brexit, telling BBC Radio 4's The Week In Westminster: ""He's a very tough, resilient operator. ""There have been red lines that have been set for him, that make the job he has to do very difficult."" Asked if any Brexit-supporters in the upper ranks of Government would want Mrs May to rethink her pre-election Brexit plan, Mr Chapman said: ""If you consider the two most powerful Brexiters in the Cabinet; David Davis and Boris Johnson, they're actually pretty liberal on issues like immigration. ""I think that there would be room to recalibrate some of this approach but at the moment she is showing no willingness to do this. ""She said that when she delivered the Lancaster House speech that's the plan and that's what she is sticking to. ""Now this is a new Parliament, there's a new reality. She has to get these things through Parliament. There's an enormous amount of legislation."" He claimed if the Prime Minister doesn't show ""more flexibility"" and ""pragmatism"" then ""she won't get this stuff through Parliament"". Mr Chapman highlighted withdrawal from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which governs the peaceful use of nuclear energy within the EU, as one area where Parliament was likely to force Mrs May into reversing her position. He suggested the Prime Minister had committed to leaving Euratom because the treaty is governed by the ECJ and allows the free movement of nuclear scientists. Mr Chapman said: ""We're withdrawing from it because of this absolutist position on the European Court."""

The person who correctly matched all seven will now be £87,570,000 richer. It is the seventh biggest ever lottery jackpot win in the UK and the lucky ticket holder will be worth more than Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe (£78m) and musician Ed Sheeran (£52m) but less than fellow singer Adele (£125m). But even though the jackpot is a massive sum of money, it is still not enough to make the Sunday Times rich list where you need to have at least £110m to be among the country's thousand wealthiest. Andy Carter, from the National Lottery, said: ""This is the third EuroMillions jackpot prize to be won here in the UK this year and it's the biggest yet.

Meanwhile, following Friday night's draw two Britons are holding tickets worth just over £200,000, and 10 have won £2,681. Mr Carter added: ""The draw also saw two UK winners of a guaranteed £1m, so we urge everyone to check their tickets to see if they've joined the National Lottery millionaires club. ""By buying a ticket for EuroMillions or any other National Lottery game, every player is helping to raise money for good causes.

2017-07-01,A new island has appeared off the coast of North Carolina but people have been warned not to swim there because of the threat of sharks and rip currents.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/new-island-appears-off-north-carolina-triggering-warning-to-swimmers-10933309,"The sandbar, nicknamed Shelly Island because of its abundance of seashells and pebbles, emerged from the sea in April and has now grown in size to about a mile long and 145 metres wide. The spit of land cannot be reached on foot and swimmers have been told to stay away because of the potential dangers. Shelly Island is just off the tip of Cape Point in Buxton and there are sharks and stingrays in the area. The narrow 15 metre-wide strip of water between the island and the mainland has also formed a ""river"" that creates a strong rip current, say experts. Bill Smith, president of the North Carolina Beach Buggy Association, told the Virginian Pilot: ""We're worried about shark bites, but we're more worried about drownings."" There could also be hooks from decades of fishing lurking just below the sand. Cape Point is a constantly changing spit of sand of about 100 acres. Sometimes the tip points south and sometimes it points north. The land shrinks and expands depending on currents and storms and the same forces were likely to have formed the sandbar, according to experts. Shelly Island could shrink or even disappear by next year, or it could expand and connect to the point. Anyone who does want to venture there has been advised to go by boat, kayak or paddleboard as they will be more used to the tides and strong currents. Chad Koczera was one of the first people to explore the newly-formed island on 31 May. He told CBS News: ""We were driving to the Point after a storm to collect shells when we spotted an area we couldn't get to by car."" He then used his drone camera to get a better look at the narrow island and has now posted photos of the sandbar which have gone viral."

But that has not stopped Donald Trump mocking its name and accusing it again of funding terrorism in comments made to Republican fundraisers. Press were barred from the event but his comments were secretly recorded at the $35,000 a head jamboree at Trump's own hotel in Washington. ""We're having a dispute with Qatar - we're supposed to say Qatar,"" he said mockingly pronouncing the country's name in two different ways. ""It's Qatar, they prefer. I prefer that they don't fund terrorism."" Three diplomatic clangers in one outburst. Firstly US presidents have in the past avoided ridiculing countries where 10,000 US military personnel are based. Secondly American diplomats are working furiously behind the scenes to broker a resolution that threatens to rip apart the Gulf Cooperation Council and undermine prosperity and stability in this part of the Middle East. They say the US is an honest neutral broker. Donald Trump apparently thinks America is having a dispute with Qatar. And thirdly in his comments he is once again taking the side of Qatar's rivals, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE and Bahrain. The quartet has isolated Qatar diplomatically and economically accusing it of funding and supporting terrorism. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is reportedly 'exhausted' from the job of clearing up after every diplomatic faux pas committed by his boss almost daily. He was thought to be furious the last time Trump sabotaged US diplomatic efforts to resolve the Qatar crisis by accusing it of funding terrorism 'at a very high level' in one of his outspoken Twitter outbursts. Tillerson reportedly blamed that on the influence of UAE ambassador to the US Yousuf al Otaiba on Donald Trump's young son in law, Jared Kushner. A source close to Tillerson reportedly said the Secretary of State 'concluded that this absolutely vacuous kid was running a second foreign policy out of the White House family quarters'. There has been concern voiced within the administration at the influence being wielded by Otaiba on the Trump administration's Middle East policy. We await the response of Tillerson and other older members of the Trump administration to their boss's latest bout of ham-fisted diplomacy."

It comes a week after Labour attacked a government ""shambles"" for initially raising, then playing down hopes that the cap could be lifted. Mr Gove told the Sunday Times: ""You've got to listen to the public sector pay review bodies. ""When they made recommendations on school teachers' pay I think I always accepted them. ""My colleagues who deal with these pay review bodies would want to respect the integrity of that process."" His intervention ties in with reports that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to demand a wage boost for NHS workers. Mr Hunt wants an end to the 1% pay cap for nurses and other health workers, citing evidence from the Government's own NHS pay review body published in March, reports the Observer. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Justine Greening is calling for an extra £1bn to protect per pupil schools funding and will demand a statement in weeks, according to the Sunday Telegraph. A Downing Street source said the Government was responding to the recommendations of public sector pay review bodies which are currently reporting to ministers ""on a case-by-case basis"". The source said the pay cap was brought in to ""deal with the mess we inherited from Labour"" and acknowledged the ""hard work and sacrifice"" made by public sector workers, saying jobs had been protected and the deficit reduced by three-quarters. :: National debate may be needed on university tuition fees - Green The source also made clear there are no moves to change tuition fee policy after Mrs May's top aide, Damian Green, said Britain may need to have a national debate on the issue. Mr Green was answering questions after a speech calling for Tory modernisation to win over young metropolitan voters who back Labour, which promised to scrap tuition fees in the election and appeared to enjoy high levels support among young voters. The First Secretary of State told the Bright Blue think-tank's conference on Saturday that the current system, with fees capped at £9,250 a year, allows UK universities to deliver high-quality courses and teaching. But he also acknowledged that student debt was a ""huge issue"", and concluded: ""It may well be that this is a national debate that we need to have."" Mr Green was speaking about a mile away from an anti-austerity demonstration in central London. :: Jeremy Corbyn: Conservatives and austerity are 'in retreat' Mr Corbyn used a speech to protesters in Parliament Square to attack the Tories for their ""shambles"" over the pay cap earlier in the week, linking the issue to the Grenfell Tower fire. He told the crowd: ""The utter hypocrisy of government ministers and others who queued up in the chamber over there in the House of Commons to heap praise on the emergency services, the following day to cut their wages by refusing to lift the pay cap.

A Conservative councillor on Kensington and Chelsea Council has said she was ""very sorry to hear"" about the claim. Catherine Faulks stressed she was ""not saying it's a tiny thing"", and acknowledged it would be very upsetting for the person affected. She insisted the council is providing a ""lot of hand-holding"" for survivors, including assigning an individual social worker for each family. Ms Williams said she received a call from the upset survivor on Friday. This is the way the leadership of the council has treated residents at this end of the borough for years,"" she said. ""I expected her response to be 'I will send an officer down to the town hall right now to check out if that's happening across the board and get back to you'. ""They could be debiting dead people's accounts, we don't know. We don't have that information, they can find that information out quickly."" Responding to the claim, Ms Faulks told the BBC's Today programme: ""I'm very sorry to hear that and I can understand that's very distressing."" Asked why the council had not addressed such an ""obvious"" issue, she replied: ""Oh come on, I'm not saying it's a tiny thing, for them it's a huge thing and it's very upsetting. ""But the council are in the process of trying to house 400 people, they have got people in hotels, they have put a social worker for every single family, who is triaging them into a wraparound service. ""I'm very sorry to hear that that happened but that person, if it's happened, will have a one person connection to go to explain that's happened who will help them sort it out. ""I know you're hearing a lot of noise about 'nothing's happening', but actually on the ground there is a lot of hand-holding going on. ""And I haven't yet heard any of the media interview or talk to somebody who has received really the excellent services we have been providing."" In a statement later, a council spokesman said: ""We are very sorry if this has happened and we are working to find out who has been affected so we can offer reassurance and an immediate refund. ""To the best of our knowledge the rent charges for Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk were stopped. ""But if anyone has had money inadvertently taken as part of a direct debit or standing order we will make arrangements to have it immediately refunded."" In her interview Ms Faulks also claimed protesters who stormed Kensington Town Hall calling for justice ""weren't the local community"" but ""people who like doing that sort of thing"". She defended the council's bid to hold a cabinet meeting about the disaster in private, at first citing public order fears, and described media attempts to report on it by obtaining a High Court order as a ""very clever stunt"". Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for commissioners to take over the running of the council after its leader and deputy leader resigned. Bhupinder Singh, a volunteer who is helping those affected by the disaster, told Sky News what's needed is ""someone with capability and skill, not just a proxy replacement"". ""The Government needs to bring in people who are specialists in disaster zones who can come and deal with disasters."""

The couple said they had been told Charlie's life support would be switched off on Friday, but the hospital confirmed they are devising plans for the little boy's care to give his family more time with him. A hospital spokeswoman said: ""Together with Charlie's parents we are putting plans in place for his care, and to give them more time together as a family. ""We would ask you to give the family and our staff some space and privacy at this distressing time."" The couple, who are in their 30s and from Bedfont, west London, had asked European court judges in Strasbourg to consider their claim after judges in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in London ruled in favour of Great Ormond Street doctors but the European Court of Human Rights refused to intervene. The couple have said they feel let down and have been denied their final wish to take Charlie home to die. In a video posted on YouTube on Thursday, they wrote: ""We are utterly heartbroken spending our last precious hours with our baby boy. ""We're not allowed to choose if our son lives and we're not allowed to choose when or where Charlie dies. ""We, and most importantly Charlie, have been massively let down throughout this whole process."" The family received donations totalling more than £1.3m to take Charlie to the US for therapy. The family also had support from campaigners on social media with hashtags including #charliesfight #Fight4Charlie and #LetCharlieGoHome. His parents said Charlie would die ""knowing that he was loved by thousands"", adding ""thank you to everyone for all your support!"""

The town's mayor, Mark Stodola, said 25 people suffered gunshots wounds and another three had unrelated injuries, but all 28 are expected to survive. ""My heart is broken this morning. My prayers are with the victims of this tragedy. We are committed to doing everything possible to bring safety to our city,"" he said in a statement. Little Rock police have dismissed the possibility of the incident being ""an active shooter or terror related"", and ordered the establishment to be shutdown and its alcohol license suspended. All 28 victims survived the attack. One of the injured had their condition upgraded from critical to stable. The shooting took place during a show by Finese 2Tymes, a performer from Memphis, Tennessee. An online poster for the performance, titled Goin' Str8 In, shows a man pointing a firearm at the camera. Gunfire reportedly broke out during a break in the concert, with some 24 shots fired in little more than ten seconds. Some of those injured were hurt by being trampled as they fled the scene. A video from inside the club shows people standing together before shots go off in a series of bursts. People can then be heard screaming and fleeing the scene as the screen goes black. Rada Bunch, a woman waiting outside the club in the aftermath of the shooting, said she feared her son may have been shot in the incident. ""I'm sick of all the killing and I'm tired of all the shooting, the kids getting hurt,"" she said. More than ten drive-by shootings have been recorded in Little Rock in the past week. Although the incidents are not thought to be linked to Saturday's shooting, the frequency will likely draw attention to gun violence in the city. Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner said there were likely multiple shooting suspects following the incident, adding that the injuries were likely the result of a dispute between two people. ""One is too many. Seventeen is very alarming and certainly disturbing,"" Mr Buckner said. One person was killed and six injured in a mass shooting at a concert in Jonestown, Arkansas, in May. Two men were charged with murder in relation to the incident. On Friday another gunman killed one person and injured five more in a shooting at a New York hospital. Henry Bello, a former doctor at the hospital, had resigned in 2015 amid sexual assault allegations. He killed himself after the rampage, which New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called a ""workplace-related incident""."

There have been five separate votes on the issue in Stormont, the last of which in 2015 saw the assembly narrowly vote in favour of gay marriage equality. But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has vetoed any law change, arguing that they are protecting the ""traditional"" definition of marriage. Campaigners have received messages of support ahead of the march from Northern Irish actor Liam Neeson, broadcaster Graham Norton and Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody. ""For once in our country this is not about religion, this is about human rights,"" actress Bronagh Waugh from The Fall and Hollyoaks told Sky News as she marched to Belfast City Hall. ""I'm standing here in solidarity with my brothers and sisters from the LGBT community. This is what the overwhelming majority of people in Northern Ireland want."" The marchers were joined on the route by gay couples from the Republic who travelled to show their support. Ironically, a return to direct rule from Westminster could remove the DUP's power to veto the law change and bring about gay marriage equality in Northern Ireland once and for all. Power-sharing talks between the DUP and Sinn Fein look unlikely to reach a deal by a deadline set on Monday. Marriage equality is one of the issues preventing the two parties from agreeing the deal."

But there are concerns victims who have now been rehoused are not receiving adequate mental health care. Nagla El-Imlahi, a community leader helping victims in hotels, told Sky News there has been a lack of proactive support. She said: ""I know people who've lost loved ones who've not been able to speak to anyone. ""Even though the offer is there, they (counsellors) need to be in the hotel with these victims. ""There has to come a point when we all act as human beings. People are distraught, people are locking themselves in hotels."" Sid-Ali Atmani, who lived on the 15th floor of Grenfell Tower, managed to escape with his wife and 10-year-old daughter. He and his family have been living out of a suitcase in a west London hotel since the fire. Mr Atmani told Sky News the blaze has left him and his family feeling like ""we don't have a future"". He said: ""I can't sleep, I can't, there's no way. The voices, the faces of my neighbours, I can't. ""I'm trapped, somewhere. My soul is there in that building, I don't think my soul is here with me, it's there with them."" Counselling has been offered by the Red Cross at the Westway Sports Centre in west London as part of the official response. The charity says it has carried out ""some outreach"" work in the local community.

2017-07-01,The public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire is set to be a wide-ranging investigation.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-fire-inquiry-six-questions-victims-want-answered-10931151,"Not only did the tragedy claim at least 80 lives, but it has revealed what one fire safety expert described as the worst ever failure in the history of British construction. As the newly appointed chairman begins to compile his terms of reference, here are six questions people want answered. 1. Why did a small fire in a fridge spread so quickly and why were so many people not able to escape?  A thorough understanding of forensic details on how the fire spread, and of the catastrophic failure of the measures in place to keep people safe, are the most pressing issues. 2. How could this happen in a building refurbished in 2016, at a cost of £10m and approved and signed off by one of London's wealthiest boroughs?  Every aspect of the building will be examined, from its original design to subsequent alterations and the latest refurbishment. 3. What documentary evidence can be found to show who was responsible for crucial aspects of the building's design and construction, and whether they did they did their jobs properly?  Chancellor Philip Hammond controversially claimed that the combustible polyethylene cladding attached to the outside of the building is banned in the UK, but the inquiry will want to look at other issues too, including the polyisocyanurate insulation panels that released deadly hydrogen cyanide gas as they burned. 4. Where were building control officers and the Government's fire investigators and safety advisers while tower blocks across the country were being covered in material that burns but was passed as fire safe?  Last year, the Government was assured by its advisers BRE Global that regulations were ""adequate"" to keep people safe. Now, the Prime Minister has said an investigation into the problem will need to look back decades. Failures in building control are potentially the most far-reaching issues to tackle. 5. Who is responsible?  As high-rise buildings across the country are stripped of their cladding following Government-ordered emergency tests, the construction industry - and the officials who regulate, advise and test its products - are all under pressure. 6. When will it end?  The Government has said it wants some answers soon, and it is thought an interim report could come out this summer. But the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war shows how public inquiries can get bogged down when those who face criticism are given the opportunity to respond before publication. With the UK construction industry worth more than £100bn a year and supporting around three million jobs - and the likelihood that Government advisers and departmental decisions will come under scrutiny - the emotional, financial and political stakes could not be higher."
2017-07-01,Sadiq Khan has called for Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council to be taken over by commissioners following the Grenfell Tower fire. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170702044930/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-demands-tougher-grenfell-tower-fire-inquiry-10932800,".Mr Khan's call came not long after council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said he would be stepping down due to ""perceived failings"" over its response to the disaster. The council came under increased pressure after its first cabinet meeting since the fire was halted abruptly on Thursday evening when journalists won access. In a letter to Theresa May, the London Mayor said: ""Following yesterday evening's shambolic council cabinet meeting, it is self-evident that the leadership of the council has lost the trust of local residents. ""Therefore, I believe the Government has no option but to immediately appoint commissioners to take over the running of council. Mr Khan added: ""It is also clear that a change in leadership from amongst the existing councillors will not address this situation - in fact it may aggravate it further, as it fails to address the fundamental breakdown in trust that has taken place."" Announcing his resignation, Mr Paget-Brown said: ""This council has been criticised for failing to answer all the questions that people have. That is properly a matter for the public inquiry. ""As council leader I have to accept my share of responsibility for these perceived failings. Deputy leader Rock Feilding-Mellen is also stepping down, saying he would ""of course co-operate in full with the public inquiry"". Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, told Sky News his reaction to Mr Paget-Brown's resignation was ""one of relief"". Mr Atkinson said Mr Paget-Brown had ""totally failed in the leadership role in the time since the disaster happened"". The resignations were met with a mixed response among victims of the blaze. Shaheena Bibi told Sky News: ""They've resigned, so what? Where's the truth, are we getting it? Is justice really for Grenfell, where is it?"" Survivor Joe Delaney said it was ""too little, too late"". He added: ""(Mr Paget-Brown) should have gone the moment it was clear how wholly underperforming RBKC have been in the wake of this tragedy. ""I don't think it is enough, they all need to resign."" Earlier, the chief executive of the group that manages Grenfell Tower stood down. Robert Black, chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, agreed to resign to ""concentrate on assisting with the investigation and inquiry"". Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has written to Theresa May demanding a broader public inquiry into the tragedy. The Labour leader says he was ""concerned to hear Sir Martin Moore-Bick indicate that the Terms of Reference for the inquiry will be narrow"". Mr Corbyn quotes Sir Martin, who is leading the inquiry, as saying it would be ""pretty well limited to the problems surrounding the start of the fire and its rapid development"". The Labour leader adds: ""I would be grateful for clarification as to who so instructed Sir Martin Moore-Bick and how his comments are compatible with the Queen's Speech commitment that residents and families of the deceased be consulted on the terms of reference for the inquiry."""

A series of deadlines have been missed to restore the multi-party devolved government in Northern Ireland, with the UK Government extending the talks process until Monday despite the Stormont parties missing Thursday's deadline set in law. Mr Adams said: ""I don't believe that there is going to be a deal by Monday. ""The DUP are showing no urgency or no real inclination to deal with the rights-based issues which are at the crux and the heart of these difficulties which we are talking here about."" He said those included republican demands for an Irish Language Act, a Bill of Rights, marriage equality and dealing with the legacy of decades of past violence. ""Unless they step-change I just cannot see, here we are on Saturday afternoon, I just cannot see how, and we told them this directly, how a deal can be put together by then."" Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire will make a statement in the House of Commons on Monday setting out the Government's plans going forward. If there is no agreement, the options open to Mr Brokenshire include setting another deadline for the talks process, calling a second snap election for the Northern Ireland Assembly or re-imposing direct rule from London. Power-sharing at Stormont collapsed in January when Ms Foster was forced from office after Sinn Fein's then deputy first minister, the late Martin McGuinness, quit. The move was in protest at the DUP's handling of the renewable heat incentive, a scheme that left the administration facing a £490m overspend. One of the sticking points in the current talks is over Sinn Fein's demands for an act officially protecting the Irish language. Republicans argue this would represent a major step towards respect and equality for all in Northern Ireland. The DUP has said it already supported Irish medium school education during years of devolved government, and accused Sinn Fein of politicising its use."

At his rally Mr Corbyn is expected to say: ""Labour is no longer just the Official Opposition, we are a government in waiting.

Labour MP David Lammy told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that Sir Martin, a retired judge, should reassess his approach and set the inquiry's scope ""in partnership"" with survivors. :: Who is Sir Martin Moore-Bick? He said: ""I'm disappointed he's expressing doubt of that kind before meeting survivors and victims. This is not a court case, there are not two sides. ""There are survivors and victims and it seems to me if you are leading an inquiry you're walking with them to get to the truth."" Questioning Sir Martin's ability to lead the inquiry, Mr Lammy said: ""He is a white, upper middle class man who I suspect has never visited a tower block housing estate and certainly has never slept a night on the 20th floor of one. ""I hope he will do that in the days ahead."" He added: ""It's a shame that we couldn't find a woman to lead the inquiry or indeed an ethnic minority. ""I think the victims will also say to themselves when push comes to shove there are some powerful people here - contractors, sub-contractors, local authorities, governments - and they look like this judge. ""Whose side will he be on? He needs to get close to those victims and survivors very quickly and establish that he is after the truth and is fearless, independent and won't be swayed because he is part of the establishment."" On Saturday, The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea confirmed it had suspended rent for residents forced to leave their homes in so-called ""finger blocks"" close to Grenfell Tower. The three buildings, on Barandon Walk, Testerton Walk and Hurstway, have been without hot water since the neighbourhood's boiler - located beneath Grenfell Tower - was destroyed in the fire.

""But it has just kept growing in reach and impact ever since."" This year, the art gallery and museum saw a 21% increase in visitor numbers, a bold new sculpture prize and an ambitious exhibitions programme including major retrospectives of Stanley Spencer and Martin Parr. ""The Hepworth serves it local community with unfailing flair and dedication,"" said Deuchar. ""It's the museum everyone would dream of having on their doorstep."" Deuchar went on: ""David Chipperfield's building has proved a perfect stage - both for the display of collections and as a platform for a breathtaking sequence of special exhibitions, curated with determined originality by the talented curatorial team."" The award is the largest museum prize in the world, and has for the first time given a £10,000 consolation prize to all its finalists. The Hepworth Wakefield was chosen from a shortlist that also included Birmingham's Lapworth Museum of Geology, the National Heritage Centre for Horseracing & Sporting Art in Newmarket, London's Sir John Soane's Museum and the Tate Modern. The Tate Modern lost despite launching a £266m extension last year. The Art Fund is the national fundraising charity for art and has, in the last five years, given £34m to help museums and art galleries.

The CQC also found that while some inadequate homes improved over the three years from 2014, a quarter of good homes deteriorated in the same period.Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of adult social care, said the report showed the majority of services met ""the mum test"" - whether you would want your mother or other relative to receive the care on offer.However, she conceded there were clear signs that services were under pressure, a problem that will only increase as the number of over-85s doubles in the next 20 years.She said: ""It appears to be increasingly difficult for some providers to deliver the safe, high quality and compassionate care people deserve and have every right to expect. ""With demand for social care expected to rise over the next two decades, this is more worrying than ever."" Social care is one of the major challenges facing the Government, which has promised a consultation in the autumn.Theresa May's attempt to tackle the issue, by scrapping a proposed cap on costs and promising no-one would be left with less than £100,000 of assets after care costs, ended in an embarrassing U-turn.The debate over new policy is likely to focus on cost, but Ms Sutcliffe stressed that quality of care should be the Government's first consideration.Andrew Dilnott, author of a report on social care for David Cameron, told Sky News the cap should be re-introduced.He said: ""In all the other big areas of our lives - our health, driving around, living in a house - we are able to share the risk of something going wrong … with social care we are not.""That is what a cap would do. It would pool the risk, share the risk across the population as a whole of being one of the unfortunate people who needs a great deal of social care. ""I think there is a huge upswell of opinion that want to see that put in place."""
2017-07-06,Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is on the brink of a multibillion-pound settlement with US regulators over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage bonds.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170706103857/http://news.sky.com/story/rbs-on-brink-of-settling-chunk-of-pre-crisis-us-mortgage-probe-10938424,"Sky News has learnt that RBS could reach a deal with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) as soon as this week, removing one of the biggest remaining obstacles to a resumption of the sale of the Government's stake in the bank. Sources said on Wednesday evening that a settlement - which analysts expect to cost RBS at least $4.5bn (£3.5bn) - was imminent, but could yet slip into next week as lawyers for both sides finalise the agreement. The precise size and timing of the fine have been moving around in recent weeks, and the FHFA penalty could ultimately be higher than $4.5bn, they added. The settlement with the FHFA relates to the mis-selling of mortgages to the US government-backed loan firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac prior to the 2008 financial crisis, when RBS was among the biggest players on Wall Street. RBS executives have been keen to agree a settlement as soon as possible as they continue their efforts to return the bank - which is more than 70%-owned by British taxpayers - to profit for the first time since 2007. However, they also have to engage in formal settlement talks with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) about another penalty related to residential mortgage-backed securities - a process which has been delayed by a clearout of senior officials at the agency under President Donald Trump's new administration. The DoJ fine will cost billions of pounds on top of the FHFA penalty. Nevertheless, a deal with the FHFA would be another important step along the road to helping RBS shed its remaining financial liabilities from the pre-crisis era. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, has been clear that he does not believe the Government should be a long-term shareholder in RBS but believes it needs to resolve many of its legacy issues first. Before the general election, Mr Hammond said that fair value for the stake could be below the 502p paid by the Labour government in 2008. RBS shares now languish at under half the average level at which £45.5bn of public money was injected to save it from collapse. If the penalty from the FHFA is in the region of $4.5bn, RBS will be able to draw on existing provisions it has set aside to pay fines for RMBS mis-selling. In January, RBS took a further $3.8bn charge for settling regulators' investigations, taking the total allocated - and so far unutilised - to £6.7bn ($8.3bn). It is likely to have to add to that if the eventual DoJ penalty is at the higher end of analysts' forecasts. RBS is the last of 18 banks to settle with the FHFA, although a number of other banks are also yet to settle with the DoJ, including Barclays, which is embroiled in a legal battle with the agency. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that HSBC had opened talks with the DoJ about a settlement. The mis-selling of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) has been - in terms of the scale of the penalties - the biggest scandal to emerge from the pre-crisis era, with investors duped into buying toxic mortgages that were packaged up by banks and sold as ultra-safe. RBS declined to comment."

Two other separation centres will be created within high-security jails, with the three quarantines holding up to 28 of the most-radicalised offenders in the country. Lee Rigby murderer Michael Adebolajo and extremist preacher Anjem Choudary could be among them. Others who spread views that might incite others to commit terrorist offences, or who are undermining security in jails, could also be moved to one of the facilities. Prisons minister Sam Gyimah said the isolation centres were ""an absolutely crucial element of our wider strategy to tackle extremism in prisons and ensure the safety of the wider public."" The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on which prisoners would be shifted to the facilities. Last month, Adebolajo was said to be ""brainwashing"" fellow inmates in HMP Frankland. The terrorist was described as spending ""most of his waking hours preaching his distorted form of Islam to anyone who will listen"", according to the Daily Mirror. The new centre at HMP Frankland was one of the main recommendations of a review which found evidence of ""charismatic"" prisoners acting as ""self-styled emirs"" to radicalise other inmates. It also suggested that ""cultural sensitivity"" among staff towards Muslim prisoners could ""inhibit the effective confrontation of extremist views"". The new isolation centres will be used to target all forms of extremism in jails, including Islamist and extreme far-right ideologies. Figures indicate that authorities are managing more than 1,000 inmates who have been identified as extremist or vulnerable to extremism at any one time."

He also spoke to personnel via the sub's intercom and donned headphones as he viewed a computer screen.

Pyongyang's latest move marked a ""new escalation of threat"" to the world, US secretary of state Rex Tillerson warned. He said the White House intended to ""enact stronger measures to hold DPRK accountable"". Mr Tillerson added the US ""will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea"" and said President Trump and his national security team were ""continuing to assess the situation""."
2017-07-06,A lawyer acting for some of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire has questioned the appointment of two experts by the Government to ensure tower blocks are safe in the future.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170706103857/http://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-lawyer-questions-role-of-two-experts-10938353,"Jolyon Maugham QC says Sir Ken Knight and Peter Bonfield are ""tainted by association"" through their links to advice given to ministers last year. That advice said regulations were ""adequate"" to cope with combustible cladding on tower blocks. :: Five reasons why Grenfell residents have yet to be rehoused Half of the members of a new expert panel in charge of advising the Government about what needs to be done to make tall buildings safe following the Grenfell Tower fire are linked to a company paid by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) to provide advice on fire safety. Dr Peter Bonfield, Chief Executive of BRE Global, sits on the new panel alongside Sir Ken Knight, who is also a trustee of BRE's charitable parent company, the BRE Trust. In documents seen by Sky News, BRE Global has been paid at least £250,000 by the DCLG for fire safety advice. BRE's report from April 2016 raised concerns that combustible cladding was fitted on buildings, but found the current regulations ""adequate"". There is no suggestion either Dr Peter Bonfield or Sir Ken Knight were involved in carrying out that research. But Mr Maugham QC said: ""I do wonder how it has come to be that of the four people appointed to this new advisory board, two of them are, to different degrees, tainted by association with advice previously given: advice that we are now suspicious of."" Following the Grenfell Tower fire, DCLG appointed BRE Global to carry out urgent tests on cladding across the country - with every sample so far failing. These tests do not assess the performance of cladding in a fire but, instead, simply check the material composition of a panel, with a machine called a bomb calorimeter. Following the first meeting of the expert panel, it was agreed that the members would provide advice to the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid on ""whether there are any changes or clarifications required to existing regulations, and provide advice on possible changes, including making recommendations on the use of specific materials"". BRE Global's rolling three-year contract with DCLG is to ""investigate issues that may have implications for Building Regulations and the guidance that supports Building Regulations"". Mr Maugham QC told Sky News: ""It's very difficult to understand how they might be able to advise the Government without worrying about what effect tomorrow might have on their legal liability for advice they gave yesterday. ""Particularly for Peter Bonfield... as chief exec, you have some ownership, definitely some moral ownership, definitely professional ownership and not inconceivable some legal ownership of the advice that organisation gave."" In a statement to Sky News, BRE said the public inquiry ""will ascertain what the contributing factors to the disaster were"" but defends Dr Bonfield's position on the advisory panel as ""a pragmatic step to take"". BRE goes on to say it stands by the conclusions in its 2016 report, and that Sir Ken Knight is both a Trustee and on the Government's Advisory Panel because he is ""perhaps one of the most respected experts in his field""."

A post shared by Jacob Rees-Mogg (@jacob_rees_mogg) on May 13, 2017 at 11:06am PDT The origin of Mr Rees-Mogg's choice of name for his latest child is likely to promote debate, as baby-name books say it is derived from a Greek name Xystus, meaning ""polished"", and should not be confused with the Latin name Sextus, meaning sixth. However, the sixth pope after St Peter took the name Sixtus, leading some to believe there is a link there due to Mr Rees-Mogg's Catholic faith. A further four Roman Catholic popes have been called Sixtus, most recently Sixtus V, consecrated in 1567.  From the Daily Mash but, for the record, I am not Doctor Who. A post shared by Jacob Rees-Mogg (@jacob_rees_mogg) on Jun 30, 2017 at 7:10am PDT Mr Rees-Mogg also appears to have been inspired by his faith in the choice of his son's middle names.

2017-07-06,"Mike Ashley arrived at court wearing a black suit, white shirt and black tie, and then spent the afternoon talking about a rival called Mr Blue.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170706103857/http://news.sky.com/story/court-case-sheds-light-on-the-world-of-mike-ashley-10938378,"It was rather as if Reservoir Dogs had come to the High Court, but with a focus on booze and business instead of guns and violence. Mr Ashley spent the morning listening intently, as he has for most of this case. As luck would have it, I sat almost directly behind him in Court 26, watching him fiddle with his tie, yawn occasionally and share a word with his lawyer, Justin Barnes. But mostly, he listened to the testimony of the bankers with whom he'd shared a pub. Mr Ashley was prepared. He brought in the following: a spiral-bound notebook, two blue biros, two highlighters (one yellow, one orange), two packs of post-it notes and his spectacles. Over the course of nearly three hours, I didn't see him make a single note. :: Mike Ashley tells court: I'm no Obi-Wan Kenobi He also had two bottles of mineral water and a small Nokia mobile phone. I know he has a Nokia because he later revealed that he favours one particular model. When I looked it up, the model was described as being a rather unexceptional, and not very smart, budget design, but Mr Ashley doesn't mind. He has a box of them that once contained 50 handsets, but now has only half as many. ""Periodically I lose, destroy, damage or have my phone stolen,"" he told the court. ""Whatever happens to a mobile phone happens to mine."" He doesn't need a very smart phone because it turns out he only reads a few of the emails that are sent to him. And he doesn't send any in return. For all the intricacies of his legal dispute with Mr Blue - which largely boils down to whether pub chat is legally enforceable - the greatest attraction of Mr Ashley's testimony was watching him in action. A self-made retail genius worth more than £2bn, but who often appears tetchy, confrontational and slightly awkward in public. And so it was in court. It didn't take long before the probing of Jeffrey Chapman QC began to annoy him. Mr Ashley began to speak slowly and deliberately, as if addressing a very small child, before his temper rose. ""Are you trying to be funny?"" he asked the barrister at one point, who simply glanced up in answer. He later answered a single ""no"" to about a dozen questions in a row, but on other occasions he could barely stop talking, saying that he wanted ""to add colour"" to the debate. Take this - on the subject of Sports Direct's share price - could it be easily manipulated? Mr Ashley held his face in his hands, his spectacles propped up on top of his head, and took in a big breath. ""The City is full of clever people,"" he said, ""and it's all about the numbers."" For numbers, read financial results. ""If I've got good numbers I could turn up at a party naked and it wouldn't matter, the share price would go up. ""If I have bad numbers, then it doesn't matter if I sign up for a monastery. The share price would go down."" He swore several times, held his head in his hands another few times, but also earned a few laughs from the court. Having described the flotation of Sports Direct as ""an unmitigated disaster"", Mr Ashley (who made more than £900m from the deal) admitted that he had already been ""fabulously wealthy"", but said money had not stopped his ambition. ""What do you think I do when I get up in the morning? Just go and buy the neighbour's house?"" He paused before adding: ""I already own it."" This whole case has revolved around questions over drinking, and this was no exception. Mr Ashley said it wasn't true that he made all his business decisions while drinking ""otherwise I'd live in a pub"", but did say that he happily held management meetings in a hotel where he would have four beers before eating, and then another two - or half a bottle of wine - with the meal. He repeatedly claimed to the court that Mr Blue was ""a liar"", but was also hard on himself. ""I am as fat as a pig,"" said Mr Ashley at one point. And in his closing words of the day, he seemed almost wistful. He said people wanted him to go to thousands of ""things"" but he always advised his team ""don't roll me out"". ""I know how disappointing it is when they actually meet me,"" said Mr Ashley. ""It is a let down. They think 'Jesus, I thought I was going to meet a bright bloke'."" And with that, the day came to an end. Mr Ashley collected his pad, his pens and his budget phone and headed out. I suspect he may have gone for a pint."

Four British players last made it to the final 32 in 1997. Murray said it showed what could be achieved by the nation's sports stars. He said: ""Aim as high as you can. Like why not try and get five, six players into the quarterfinals of slams? Why not? ""Like, it's better to set the goal as high as possible and fall a little bit short than go, 'Yeah, we're delighted with five or six players in the second or third round of a slam.' ""It's not to say that getting to the third round isn't good, but some of the players, like Kyle and Heather and Jo, they're capable of doing more than that. ""So let's aim to try and go further."" The performance of Konta and Watson gave British women's tennis its best showing at the All England Club Championships in more than 30 years. The last time two British women made it to the third round was in 1986. Murray eased through his match against Germany's Dustin Brown 6-3 6-2 6-2. Konta had a scare against Croatia's Donna Vekic, eventually coming through 7-6, 4-6, 10-8.

Most of those arrested are also believed to be British. The victims come from all parts of the UK. It is understood they paid between £550 and £2,700. Police said the suspects used forged documents to pose as legitimate businessmen and also employed accomplices who would try to dupe victims who had already been left out of pocket by claiming they could help them get their money back. More than £100,000 in cash, 10 designer watches, gems and seven vehicles including a Ferrari were seized during raids on a lawyer's office and the headquarters of the firm. A yacht was also confiscated. The company is based in the coastal city of Velez-Malaga, east of Malaga. ""National Police officers have smashed a criminal organisation based in the province of Malaga specialising in timeshare fraud,"" a police spokesman said. ""Thirty-six people have been arrested, and another placed under formal investigation but not arrested, on suspicion of fraud, money laundering, forgery and membership of a criminal organisation."" The spokesman added: ""Among those detained are the alleged ringleader, a British man, and two lawyers believed to have been responsible for the money laundering. ""The suspects offered their customers, all British and timeshare owners, a timeshare holiday product."" The police operation was codenamed Manta - Spanish for blanket. The raids came after police were asked to act on a complaint filed by a lawyer acting for 33 Britons. Spanish police said they had discovered ""a criminal network composed mainly of six people, namely the main suspect and intellectual author, his wife, his son and his daughter-in-law, all people he trusted who were on the next level down to him"". They also said two lawyers were suspected of being in charge of the money laundering and that there were 30 accomplices. Police explained how the alleged scam worked: ""The suspects contacted potential victims, all timeshare owners and all British, and offered them the possibility of acquiring a holiday package as well as selling their timeshare to other possible buyers. ""To start the ball rolling, and buy or sell the holiday package, they would ask their victims for a sum of money they termed a deposit. ""After reaching agreement with the victims, they would dupe them into making bank transfers. ""They realised after the sale or purchase didn't go through that they had been duped."" All those arrested have been remanded in custody after appearing before a judge. Police did not name any of the suspects at Wednesday's press conference."

She said the Government would consider recommendations about public sector pay levels ""very carefully"", but insisted that any decision to lift the cap must be measured against the need for fairness and fiscal discipline. ""That is the balance that we need to strike and we continue to assess that balance,"" she said. Mrs May added: ""There are outstanding pay review body reports, those cover teachers, prison officers, police officers and senior salaries and the Government will consider those reports very carefully and will respond to them. ""But while we do that we will always recognise that we need to take those decisions against the need to live within our means."" :: David Cameron calls austerity opponents 'selfish' The PM's robust defence comes as pressure to ease austerity after seven years has been piling - and puts her on a collision course with members of her own Cabinet. Critics say the 1% pay rise amounts to a pay cut as inflation is about to hit 3%. Public support for firefighters, doctors and other emergency workers has increased in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire and of the recent terror attacks in London and Manchester. Tens of thousands of people marched in the capital last weekend to demand an end to austerity. The Cabinet has been split on the issue, with Boris Johnson recently backing a move to ease the 1% limit. During PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn sought to expose those divisions, saying there had been a ""week of flipflopping and floundering"" by the Government. He accused the Conservatives of ""recklessly exploiting the goodwill"" of public sector workers. ""There is a low pay epidemic in this country, and it has a terrible effect on young people,"" said the Labour leader. In a reference to the Tories' deal with the DUP to prop up Mrs May's minority government, Mr Corbyn said: ""The Prime Minister found £1bn to keep her own job. Why can't she find the same amount of money to keep nurses and teachers in their own job, who after all serve all of us?"" Mrs May has insisted that Labour had left the Conservatives with the ""biggest deficit in our peacetime history"". She said: ""I know (Mr Corbyn) has taken to calling himself a government in waiting. ""We all know that means - waiting to put up taxes, waiting to destroy jobs, waiting to bankrupt our country. We will never let it happen."""

He said the grabber of the crane stuck out the side of the lorry and hooked on to a Vauxhall Corsa by its roof. The car then acted like ""a battering ram"" as the truck hurtled down a residential street in Oldham, he said. Several vehicles were then hit by the car, including Mr Kellett's van, which suffered significant damage to the front and rear and has now been written off. The Corsa ended up in someone's garden, he said. He told Sky News of the incident: ""Ten seconds later and I would have been in the car. I wouldn't have seen it coming. ""I could have been dead. I would have been smashed around. The street was like a war zone"". The lorry had reportedly been stolen from a builder's merchant moments earlier. It's crane ploughed into about 10 vehicles, causing some of them to flip over in the street. The truck was believed to have been found burnt-out about a mile away from where it was taken at the Si-Tec store in Oldham. Images, taken by local resident David Ragg, showed a number of damaged vehicles on Hadfield Road. Mr Ragg spoke of his ""shock"" at seeing the destruction after he left his house for work. He told Sky News the scene was ""bizarre"" and compared it to the aftermath of a car chase. Mr Ragg said when he got to the builders' merchant, it was a ""mess"". He went on: ""The wall at the side was demolished."" Police are now looking into the incident. A statement by the Greater Manchester force said: ""Police were called shortly before 7am to reports that a vehicle had overturned on Hadfield Street, Oldham.

No one had been more surprised than the DUP and Sinn Fein - the two parties at the negotiating table - when he told the House they were making progress in the talks. But why would the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland talk up the prospects for a breakthrough when the two main parties were briefing journalists to the contrary? Were the DUP and Sinn Fein indicating compromise privately but denying it publicly? Sources close to the negotiating team of each party are adamant that was not the case. The Democratic Unionists believe James Brokenshire was simply buying more time for the parties before calling another election or moving to restore direct rule from Westminster. But Sinn Fein suspects the Northern Ireland Secretary could not admit the scale of the problem in Northern Ireland while the Democratic Unionists are propping up the Tories. That's what the party's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill, means when she says the devolution vacuum constitutes ""a monumental failure by Theresa May"". By constantly pushing back ""deadlines"", the British Government has created the impression it does not know what to do about Northern Ireland, six months after the devolved government collapsed. For the 19 years since the Good Friday Agreement, relative political stability in the form of a power-sharing government at Stormont has helped maintain a relative peace here. DUP leader Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill don't have the option of heading to the beach and burying their heads in the sand this summer. If they can't find a way to rebuild the trust that enabled their parties to share power in the past, there will be a dark cloud over Northern Ireland's hope for a politically stable future."

Three million files and 16,000 hours of CCTV have been collected as police have sought to detail Abedi's movements in the days and weeks before the attack, and establish any terrorist connections he may have. Police believe they have a clear picture of Abedi's movements but are still looking at how he acquired the skills to build his bomb. They said he appeared to have spent ""many months"" planning the atrocity - but had left no note or video explaining his motivations for the attack. A landfill site is still being searched for a blue suitcase connected to Abedi. Meanwhile, Grande has paid tribute to the youngest victim of the bombing after performing in Buenos Aires. ""Saffie we're (thinking) of you baby,"" she wrote alongside a birthday cake emoji on her Instagram account.

2017-07-06,"Charlie Gard's parents say that support from President Trump and Pope Francis has given them ""hope"".  ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170706103857/http://news.sky.com/story/british-doctors-must-treat-charlie-gard-boris-johnson-tells-italy-10937853,"Chris Gard and Connie Yates have campaigned to take 11-month-old Charlie, who has a rare genetic condition, to the US for experimental treatment. There have been donations of more than £1.3m to support a trip. Last week, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a plea from Charlie's parents to intervene in the case, which has reached the end of the line in the UK courts. Pope Francis has said Charlie's parents should be allowed to ""accompany and treat their child until the end"", while the Vatican's children's hospital has offered to care for their son. Mr Trump has also offered help. A family spokesman said: ""The White House has been in talks with Charlie's family, GOSH (Great Ormond Street Hospital), the UK Government, the Department of Health and the American doctor who wants to treat Charlie. ""President Trump has a very good understanding of the whole case and he did not make an off-the-cuff tweet."" Charlie's mum Connie said: ""The support from the Pope and the President has given us hope. ""They are traditional men who believe in the family. ""They believe in our case and understand why we believe it is right to continue fighting so hard to save Charlie."" Charlie has mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. He is only the 16th person in the world to ever have been diagnosed with the condition. Genetics expert Lord Winston told ITV that the ""interferences from the Vatican and from Donald Trump seem to me to be extremely unhelpful and very cruel, actually"". That was because Charlie was being treated ""at a hospital which has huge expertise in mitochondrial disease and is being offered a break in a hospital that has never published anything on this disease, as far as I'm aware"". Earlier, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told his Italian counterpart that Charlie's future should be ""led by expert medical opinion, supported by the courts"". Following the meeting on Wednesday, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""Minister (Angelino) Alfano raised the case of Charlie Gard and the Pope's recent offer of treatment in Italy. ""The Foreign Secretary said this was a deeply tragic and complex case for all involved, and said it was right that decisions continued to be led by expert medical opinion, supported by the courts, in line with Charlie's best interests."" :: Charlie Gard 'will die knowing he was loved', say parents At PMQs the family's MP, Seema Malhotra, asked the Prime Minister to do ""all she can"" regarding the possibility of Charlie being flown to the US. Theresa May told MPs she was confident that Great Ormond Street ""have and always will consider any offers or new information that has come forward with consideration of the well-being of a desperately ill child"". The Prime Minister added: ""It is an unimaginable position for anybody to be in and I fully understand and appreciate that any parent in these circumstances will want to do everything possible and explore every option for their seriously ill child. ""But I also know that no doctor ever wants to be placed in the terrible position where they have to make such heartbreaking decisions."" Last week, Charlie's parents were given more time before his life support machine is turned off."
2017-07-06,"Three-quarters of graduates will never clear their students loan debt, according to a report.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170706103857/http://news.sky.com/story/most-university-graduates-will-never-clear-their-student-debt-10937245,"Most graduates will still be paying off their loans well into their 50s, with the Institute of Fiscal Studies report blaming high fees and large maintenance loans. English graduates have the ""highest student debts in the developed world"", the IFS said. Coalition government reforms in 2012 initially saw the lowest-earning third of graduates better off by about £1,500 but the replacement of maintenance grants with loans meant debt rates went up quickly. This has resulted in students from low-income families graduating with debt levels of more than £57,000, meaning the gains they initially enjoyed after the coalition's shake-up on tuition fees have more than been wiped out since. Interest rates on student debt are ""very high"", reaching up to 3% above inflation, according to the report. This means that the average student who borrows £45,000 will pay a further £5,800 in interest, while those earning higher incomes could have to pay out another £40,000 in interest, the IFS said. The study added: ""There is a risk that better-off parents will pay fees up front, especially if they think their offspring will be high earners. ""This would increase the cost to the government in the long run."" Institutions now get 25% more funding per student than they did in 2011 and most of this is funded by richer graduates. Universities now get an average of £28,000 per student per degree. Jack Britton, one of the report's authors, said: ""Recent policy changes have increased university funding and reduced long-term government spending on higher education while substantially increasing payments by graduates, especially high-earning graduates. ""There is probably not much further to go down this route, but proposals for reducing student fees tend to hit the public finances while benefiting high earners the most."" The report stated: ""Reducing tuition fees or bringing back maintenance grants would have the advantage of allowing government to target specific students or courses that have wider benefits to society. ""This would, however, significantly increase deficit spending and lead to a smaller, but still considerable, increase in the long-run government contribution."""

She was found with head and upper body injuries near the recycling bins at around 12.40am on Tuesday. The attack is believed to have taken place at around 11.40pm on Monday night. She was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries and remains in a critical condition. It is not yet clear whether she knew her attacker. Police are appealing for anyone who was in the park between 11pm and 12.40am to come forward. They said the attacker would have been heavily bloodstained due to the ferocity of the attack. Part of the park has been cordoned off for forensic investigation and CCTV footage of the area is being looked at by police."
2017-07-06,A specialist taskforce is to be sent in to Kensington and Chelsea Council to take over key services after the Grenfell Tower fire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170706103857/http://news.sky.com/story/taskforce-to-run-key-services-at-council-after-grenfell-tower-fire-10937428,"Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that outside experts will be brought in to manage the council's housing, regeneration, community engagement and governance services. It comes as police said they had made ""87 recoveries"" of human remains from the tower, but stressed the ""catastrophic damage"" inside means ""that is not 87 people"". There has been heavy criticism of the council's response to the disaster, which left at least 80 people dead. But the taskforce falls short of demands from London mayor Sadiq Khan for ministers to appoint external commissioners to take over the running of the entire council. In response, Mr Khan said the taskforce was the ""minimum"" that could be done, and warned the Government it risks ""making the situation worse rather than better"". He said: ""The fundamental problem in Kensington and Chelsea now is the total lack of trust from the local community in the council and elected councillors . ""As a result of this breakdown of authority, the council will find it almost impossible to begin giving the community the support and services it desperately needs."" The new team is expected to be phased in as the current Grenfell Tower Response Team is gradually wound down in the immediate aftermath of the blaze. The new council leader, Elizabeth Campbell, who was elected following the resignation of Nicholas Paget-Brown, has welcomed the news, saying the scale of the disaster ""makes it impossible for one organisation to cope on its own"". The Metropolitan Police said some 21 bodies had been formally identified by the coroner and their families informed. A search by hand has started now that the ""last of the visible human remains"" have been recovered, according to Commander Stuart Cundy. He said this will involve investigators, supported by anthropologists, ""meticulously"" sifting through about 15.5 tonnes of debris on each floor. Mr Cundy said he does not want there to be any ""hidden victims"", adding that his team has spoken to at least one person from 106 of the 129 flats in the block. Three weeks on from the fire, hundreds of residents are still living in emergency accommodation after refusing offers of temporary housing. The Grenfell Tower Response Team has confirmed that 139 offers have been made - but only 14 have been accepted. Prime Minister Theresa May promised to offer good quality temporary accommodation to all those displaced within three weeks - a target the Government says has been met. Housing minister Alok Sharma, who fought back tears as recalled speaking to survivors, has said he expects the number of those accepting temporary accommodation offers to rise. He said the ""pace"" the families want to move at has to be respected, and added 200 ""good quality properties"" will be offered to residents. It has also been announced by Home Office minister Brandon Lewis that foreign nationals affected will be allowed to stay in the UK for 12 months regardless of their immigration status so they can ""deal with the extremely difficult circumstances"". Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark Council and a spokesperson of the Grenfell Fire Response Team, told Sky News the residents could require support for ""decades"" to come. Meanwhile, the retired judge leading the public inquiry into the fire has said he is prepared to listen to a ""broad range of evidence, including on the role of the relevant public authorities and contractors"". Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who has faced calls to quit, said he wants to hear from people directly affected about the ""questions we should be seeking to answer"" as he investigates the tragedy."
2017-07-06,A major tax avoidance case involving Rangers is expected to pressure other football clubs into settling historic bills with HM Revenue & Customs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170706103857/http://news.sky.com/story/taxman-targets-football-clubs-after-winning-rangers-case-10937620,"After winning a Supreme Court fight against liquidators of the company previously known as Rangers Football Club, the taxman has ""encouraged"" other entities running similar schemes to agree payments. They are believed to number in the thousands and include other UK clubs. The case related to the Scottish club's use of a controversial Employee Benefit Trust which paid about £50m to players and staff between 2001 and 2009. Rangers later suffered a financial collapse over a separate tax debt in 2012 during different ownership. It was argued in court that the payments, administered by the club's majority shareholder Murray Group over those eight years, should be classified as loans but HMRC insisted they were taxable earnings. Sir David Murray, who was chairman of Rangers at the time, expressed his disappointment with the verdict. He told the Press Association: ""The decision runs counter to the legal advice which was consistently provided to Rangers Football Club, that on the basis of the law and legal precedent at the time, the contributions made to the trust were not earnings and should not be taxed as such."" He added: ""The decision will be greeted with dismay by the ordinary creditors of the club, many of which are small businesses, who will now receive a much lower distribution in the liquidation of the club, which occurred during the ownership of Craig Whyte, than may otherwise have been the case. ""I have not had the opportunity to discuss the decision in detail with tax counsel, but will do so, particularly in light of proposed legislation, which will alter the tax position applying to loans made by trusts to employees."" HMRC said: ""The unanimous decision of the Supreme Court supports our view that Employment Benefit Trust avoidance schemes simply do not work. ""This decision has wide-ranging implications for other avoidance cases and we encourage anyone who's tried to avoid tax on their earnings to now agree with us the tax owed. ""HMRC will always challenge contrived arrangements that try to deliver tax advantages never intended by Parliament."" The verdict will not have a direct impact on the club as it exists now, as it is under different ownership."

The flashpoint is the contested border region of Doklam in Bhutan, which is claimed by China as part of its Donglang region. But Bhutan has no diplomatic ties with China and is supported militarily and diplomatically by India. The problem arose when the Chinese military tried to extend its border road at Doklam. India is concerned about how much access the road would allow China's military at such a strategic point. For India, this area is significant as it is the only territory where India has a tactical advantage. India and China share a 2,174-mile border, with some parts still being contested. In an interview with the Press Trust of India, Lau Zhaohui, the Chinese Ambassador to India, said the ""ball is in India's court"". ""There have been talks of this option and that option,"" Lau said. ""The Chinese government wants a peaceful resolution and withdrawal of Indian troops from the area is a precondition."" India's external affairs ministry says the country is ""deeply concerned"" at the developments, adding that constructing the road would represent a significant change to the status quo, which would have serious security implications for India. Video footage of soldiers arguing and in scuffles have been playing out in newsrooms in India. Meanwhile, the Chinese media rhetoric has gone shriller - talk of war being an option and reminders of India's humiliating defeat in the 1962 war. But India's defence minister, Arun Jaitley, has warned that the India of 2017 is not the India of 1962 and the country will defend its territorial integrity. The standoff between the two Asian giants shows no signs of abating, with other points of tension being: :: India accused China of destroying two bunkers in the Sikkim sector, which the Chinese have denied :: India has been home to the Tibetan spiritual head the Dalai Lama since he fled China in 1959. This has been a major impediment in relations between the two countries, as China considers him a separatist leader and anti-China :: China has close military, economical and diplomatic relations with Pakistan, India's historical arch rival :: India is also concerned of being ring-fenced in the Indian Ocean with the Chinese building ports in Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The military build-up in the South China Sea has made the Indians even more suspicious of all Chinese military manoeuvres."

The 'Siberian Express'? The 'Siberian Bull'? 'Death From Above'? Played by Dolph Lundgren, the Russian boxer had almost as many aliases as lines in the film, but he remains one of Rocky's most iconic characters. In Rocky IV, he famously killed Rocky's friend and trainer Apollo Creed in the ring, with a ridiculously high 2,000 psi punch. ""If he dies, he dies,"" the Soviet says in the film, after landing the killing blow.  Here's a chance to stretch your imagination ...

""Here's a chance to stretch your imagination,"" Stallone posted on Instagram, with a photo montage of himself overlooking the ring, with Creed and Drago facing each other. ""HISTORY WILL ALWAYS REPEAT ITSELF IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, JUST GOT TO BE READY!"" he added. ""Sins of the father... #creed2 #rockybalboa."" Little detail is known of the sequel, which will see Michael B Jordan reprise his role as Adonis Creed, Apollo's son and Rocky's protege. It is unclear if Coogler will once again sit in the director's chair, after his revamp of the franchise earned him widespread acclaim. Even Stallone's recent post is still a matter of debate, with fans and critics wondering if it means Drago will return himself or if it is time for his son to take on Creed. Either way, it comes at a time when US-Russia relations are again in the spotlight, similar to when Rocky IV was released in the Cold War year of 1985. At the time, the film conveyed the fear and antagonism between the two countries, culminating in an emotional speech by the main character. In 1985, Rocky Balboa won over the Moscow crowd and brought the two nations closer together. Creed will return in 2018."

Miguel Alves, who lived with his family on the 13th floor of the tower, told Sky News: ""I've had the offer, but I've not had the opportunity to see it yet. It's not ready yet, and I'm waiting for it. ""I know that things take time, but stability for us is the most important thing. We want to look for something permanent in the near future. ""My kids start school in September. They did well up until now, and I don't want them to break down. It's very important, stability. My daughter asked the other day if we could go home. It was very sad for us."" :: Trauma of living in another tower block Mahad Egal, who escaped from his fourth floor flat with his wife and two children, has criticised the Government for what he called a ""poor response from the beginning"". Mr Egal told Sky News: ""We have been offered a property outside the borough, that doesn't meet our requirements in terms of suitability for the children and my wife. ""It's not what we asked for. We asked for a like-for-like swap for the property we had."" The property Mr Egal was offered was within a similar tower in the borough of Westminster, but he explained: ""It's traumatising to be going up flights of stairs or high-rise towers, which is the only exception in our requirement. :: Grenfell Tower: One of Britain's worst tragedies ""If (the council) cannot meet the requirements and specific needs of survivors then they should be honest. There is no point building our hopes, and then they collapse. ""Three weeks is enough time to do what you need to do to re-home four people."" His family is now living between friends and family while waiting for permanent accommodation. :: Location and suitability Antonio Roncolato and his son Christopher lived in a flat on the 10th floor for almost 30 years. They are currently living in their second hotel, after refusing two offers of temporary accommodation because it was too far out of the borough. ""We want a place we can call home. There is no point in the Prime Minister making promises, it needs to be realistic and sincere. We feel like we've been taken for a ride."" When asked whether residents were being forced out of the area, chief executive of Southwark Council and spokesperson of the Grenfell Fire Response Team Eleanor Kelly told Sky News: ""There is absolutely no push for anyone to go to any of the surrounding boroughs or to go anywhere else. ""If people want to wait to make their permanent home in Kensington and Chelsea then that's exactly what will happen."" :: Holding out for a permanent home When asked why only 14 households had so far accepted offers of temporary accommodation, Ms Kelly told Sky News: ""People are much more focused on where their permanent accommodation might be."" She said that somewhere in the order of 60 families are now on their second offer and 21 families are on their third offer of housing. :: Grenfell victims' anger as deadline passes Ms Kelly explained: ""We'll continue to work our way through the properties that are available in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and Hammersmith and Fulham to see whether they are suitable to the families for either temporary or permanent accommodation. ""Very many of them are preferring to stay in (emergency hotel) accommodation to give themselves time to think about where they really want to go and what sort of permanent offer they want to receive."" Ms Kelly says 68 new permanent properties in Kensington and Chelsea - effectively tenancies for life - will become available at the end of this month. :: Increased rent Some residents are concerned about their rent going up in new accommodation, with some estimating their rental costs could increase three-fold following a one-year rent-free period. Ms Kelly told Sky News that some residents who are rehoused could end up paying more in rent, but said support would be available to them. She said: ""It's not that they won't be paying more than they were in Grenfell Tower. Grenfell Tower only had one and two-bedroom flats, and we do know that there were issues with over-occupancy. ""That means that many families will be moving into properties that were much bigger than the properties that they had in Grenfell Tower."" She also said a financial support and benefits systems would be available ""to assist people to live in the permanent accommodation that they choose""."

The items found in a lock-up garage sparked concern that potential attackers could have been plotting to pose as police and other officials. It is also feared the discovery of the store, which followed the search of six properties, could provoke an attack similar to the bombings in the Belgian capital last year. The attack on an airport and a metro station on 22 March, 2016, which killed 32 and injured more than 300, occurred after police uncovered a weapons cache as they hunted an Islamic State cell linked to attacks in Paris the year before. Police charged two brothers of a convicted jihadist on Wednesday but revealed on Thursday they are looking for further members of a possible terror cell. Eric van der Sypt, spokesman for the country's federal prosecutors' office, said: ""We are still looking for several terrorism suspects. ""We fear they may feel cornered. We therefore fear there could be the same reaction as on March 22."" He later insisted officials had no ""new element"" to suggest an attack was imminent, but added: ""One can never know how these people might react."" Belgian nationals Akim and Khalid Saouti, who were among four people detained in overnight raids on Tuesday, are believed to be the brothers of Said Saouti, a member of the Kamikaze Riders motorcycle club. They were charged on Wednesday with belonging to a ""terrorist group"" and suspected of planning an attack. Last year, Said was jailed for recruiting people to jihadist organisations and supporting IS on social media. The Kamikaze Riders are feared to be closely associated with terror groups active in Iraq and Syria and were suspected to be linked to foiled attacks in Brussels in late 2015. Of the four people held in the Anderlecht area of Brussels on Wednesday, two were later released after questioning. A fifth man, reportedly suspected of planning a ""violent attack"", was arrested across the border in northern France, close to the city of Lille. Belgian and French police co-operated on the joint investigation, with prosecutors saying the raids were ""directly linked"" to members of the Kamikaze Riders and not part of the investigation into the Brussels and Paris attacks. France remains in a state of emergency following the November 2015 attack in the French capital, which killed 130. The Foreign Office has warned UK travellers that Belgium is ""very likely"" to be the target of terror attackers. Last month, a man attempting to set off a bomb in Brussels' Central Station was shot dead by a soldier."

""We oppose them and next time we are in Government we will ban them."" Asked whether the row could lead Mr Corbyn to boycott the festival in future, the Labour spokesman said: ""Jeremy and the Labour Party have taken a very strong stand against the use of zero-hours contracts and the exploitation of migrant and other workers and we would take that view wherever it happened."" During his appearance on the Somerset festival's Pyramid Stage, Mr Corbyn said young people should not have to ""accept low wages and insecurity as just part of life"", and vowed to ban zero-hours contracts. Mr Corbyn was met with loud cheers from the crowds, with thousands chanting his name to the tune of the White Stripes' Seven Nation Army. But organisers, including founder Michael Eavis, have faced criticism after reports said that hundreds of workers from across Europe were hired on zero-hours contracts to clear up after the festival. Many reportedly found themselves dismissed after just two days because there was not as much litter as expected. Asked whether Mr Corbyn would raise the issue with organisers next time he visits the festival, the spokesman said: ""He is happy to raise it right now. ""This kind of contract and these kinds of employment conditions are unacceptable."""

He died as a result of those injuries on 22 June. Police said new footage had emerged taken from the entrance to the gated community where Williams lives. The statement said: ""Based on the evidence obtained in the ongoing investigation, it has been determined the vehicle driven by Venus Williams lawfully entered the intersection on a circular green traffic signal."" It had been thought that Williams, 37, had run a red light, failing to give way to the Barsons. The footage from Palm Beach Gardens Police Department shows Williams headed north and, as the light went green, she went forward but had to stop as a car turned left in front of her. She then moved forward again before being struck by the car driven by Mrs Barson who, by then, had the green light. Major Paul Rogers of the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department said police have not made a final determination of fault in the investigation. Williams has not been cited or charged but the Barson family filed a wrongful death suit against her last week. Mr Barson's family attorney, Michael Steinger, said in a statement that the video ""continues to support the fact that Ms Williams remained in the intersection at a red light, violating the Barsons' right of way."" Williams' lawyer, Malcolm Cunningham, said it was Mrs Barson's obligation to make sure no cars remained in the intersection before she entered. Williams, a former world number one, won her third-round match at Wimbledon on Friday."

""When I saw him after, he had his hands bandaged up and his head. He either lived there and managed to get out or he was trying to get in."" Detective Chief Inspector Chris Bridge, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""This appears to be a family home and we have been working to inform loved ones of this awful loss. ""This happened on a Saturday morning when many people would be up and about and I would appeal to anyone with any information about this incident to please call us."""
2017-07-08,A group of artists are fighting online prejudice against the LGBT community by producing work inspired by troll tweets.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170708150945/http://news.sky.com/story/artists-take-on-trolls-hateful-tweets-turned-into-loving-artwork-10941282,"""It's a thing that causes pain to a lot of people,"" says artist Ricardo Bessa. ""I've felt it, I know friends who've felt it."" He is one of six artists who have been taking part in Smirnoff's #chooselove project. In the build-up to Pride celebrations in London, they've been using the messages on social media as starting point for their illustrations. One of Bessa's pieces is a composition of gay couples kissing. It is a response to a Twitter user's comments about the gay coming-of-age movie Moonlight, which said: ""Of course the 'best kiss' @MTVAwards was given to two men, excuse me now while I puke."" Bessa says: ""The internet is pretty unfiltered now, which for the most part is good. It's up to the social media companies to try and protect their users from this kind of harassment... because that's what it is, harassment."" Becca Human's work is a response to a tweet that said ""Don't be gay and gross on social media"". ""If someone is telling you not to be yourself online - the most radical and powerful thing you can do is to be yourself online,"" she says. A report by charity Galop found one in three members of the LGBT community (31%) have experienced online abuse targeting their sexual orientation or gender identity. Social media psychologist Dr Arthur Cassidy says trolls seek out anyone who might seem vulnerable. ""The motivation and personality of trolls is to target people that have been marginalised, disenfranchised, simply because of this dis-inhibition effect, which means 'I can literally do things online so long as I'm anonymous'."" Writing for The Guardian, Phil Adlem, a policeman who proposed to his boyfriend during last year's Pride parade in London, recently said that seeing some of the hate-filled comments that followed ""completely floored him"". Rebecca Stinson, head of trans inclusion at Stonewall, is all too familiar with how that can feel. ""People still don't understand that this is real life and at the end of that account Phil was sat there being able to see the responses."" As a public LGBT campaigner, abuse is something she has, unfortunately, come to accept. ""You find that trolls delete it pretty quickly after they've sent it because they don't like it being traced back to them. ""It is dangerous to a person's well-being when you put yourself out there, but it's also important that we have visible role models."""
2017-07-08,Francis Rossi admits he's not shed any tears for his Status Quo partner Rick Parfitt who died on Christmas Eve.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170708150945/http://news.sky.com/story/status-quos-francis-rossi-reflects-on-death-of-bandmate-rick-parfitt-10939996,"But in an exclusive interview with Sky News, Rossi defended himself against claims that he treated Parfitt unfairly in the final months of his life. Parfitt, a rock guitarist, died from an infection six months after surviving a major heart attack. However Rossi, who watched paramedics trying to resuscitate him last June, said they should not have fought so hard to save his life. Talking in the recording studio at his home, Rossi admitted their relationship had become strained in recent years. ""People think I hated Rick. ""We got fractious between us at times, and he could be a pest, but he was my best friend for a long, long time. ""There were times when we would still sit together and we'd laugh and we'd joke."" But he said their comedy double-act on TV was a facade, they would spend less and less time together, and there were arguments about Parfitt's drinking. ""He was desperate, trying to be this rock person, to live up to that image. It wasn't who Rick was at all."" Because of Parfitt's health problems, Status Quo seemed to be heading for retirement. They started performing acoustic sets, and a final tour called The Last Night Of The Electrics was planned. But in June 2016, shortly after a concert in Turkey, Parfitt suffered a major heart attack in his hotel room. The rest of the band witnessed paramedics fighting to resuscitate him and Rossi was horrified. ""I know what I feel for Rick inside. ""That's when it hurt. ""That's when I should have stopped them. ""I wanted them to leave him alone. ""They were physically hurting him and if you saw the state he was in and what they were doing to his body... ""I wanted to hurt the people who did that."" When asked whether he wishes Parfitt had died that night, Rossi said: ""No, that's a thing a journalist would get me saying on camera. ""He was dead as far as I was concerned."" He said that in the weeks after Parfitt regained consciousness, he had mental problems and thought he was back in the 1980s. Parfitt agreed he wasn't well enough to continue playing in the band, and revealed he was quitting in a Sky News interview in September. Three months later, complications from a shoulder injury led to an infection which spread quickly. He died in a Spanish hospital on Christmas Eve. Rossi admits the death came as a shock. ""But once you get over that shock... do you shed tears?"" I asked. ""No."" ""People will be surprised at that, Francis,"" I said. ""I didn't cry when my mother died. I didn't cry when my father died. ""For me, (Parfitt) died in Turkey."" Some fans have criticised Rossi for failing to pay tribute to Parfitt during concerts since his death, but he said: ""I don't believe in opening up a show saying 'it's really, really sad tonight that Rick's not going to be here'. ""I'm digging a hole for myself."" ""But some fans want that,"" I said. ""They're not getting that from me. ""I'm sorry if that upsets them, I really am. I'm just not like that."" Rossi said the band paid for Parfitt's body to be flown home, and for his funeral. ""There were such squabbles within his family. ""Let's not go there, it's kind of ugly. ""I just wanted to get over it and bury my partner and get on with it."" Status Quo have now shelved retirement plans, with Irish guitarist Richie Malone replacing Parfitt. Extra concerts have been announced, and an album and video will be released of the new line-up in concert, recorded shortly before Parfitt died. Rossi said he was enjoying playing as much as ever. ""I'm not saying it's better or worse. It's different. ""Now, some Quo fans don't want to know about different but I'm enthused again."" Rossi said if he had been the one to die first, Parfitt would have wanted the show to go on."
2017-07-08,"On Monday, the Northern Ireland Secretary told the Commons he believed a deal to restore power-sharing at Stormont was achievable ""possibly as early as this week.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170708150945/http://news.sky.com/story/why-did-brokenshire-talk-up-the-prospect-of-stormont-power-sharing-deal-10937092,"Twenty-four hours later, James Brokenshire conceded what most commentators had long concluded - that both sides would not be able to reach agreement ""in the immediate term"". No one had been more surprised than the DUP and Sinn Fein - the two parties at the negotiating table - when he told the House they were making progress in the talks. But why would the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland talk up the prospects for a breakthrough when the two main parties were briefing journalists to the contrary? Were the DUP and Sinn Fein indicating compromise privately but denying it publicly? Sources close to the negotiating team of each party are adamant that was not the case. The Democratic Unionists believe James Brokenshire was simply buying more time for the parties before calling another election or moving to restore direct rule from Westminster. But Sinn Fein suspects the Northern Ireland Secretary could not admit the scale of the problem in Northern Ireland while the Democratic Unionists are propping up the Tories. That's what the party's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill, means when she says the devolution vacuum constitutes ""a monumental failure by Theresa May"". By constantly pushing back ""deadlines"", the British Government has created the impression it does not know what to do about Northern Ireland, six months after the devolved government collapsed. For the 19 years since the Good Friday Agreement, relative political stability in the form of a power-sharing government at Stormont has helped maintain a relative peace here. DUP leader Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill don't have the option of heading to the beach and burying their heads in the sand this summer. If they can't find a way to rebuild the trust that enabled their parties to share power in the past, there will be a dark cloud over Northern Ireland's hope for a politically stable future."

Officers were called to the property in Albion at around 1am on Friday and found Ms Farman's body in bed. They also discovered her 10-year-old autistic son, who they passed into the care of the child development unit. Officers on the Indian Ocean island are now hunting three suspects. A police spokesman said: ""The car has been found. It will be examined and we hope we will get evidence from the vehicle."" Ms Farman, thought to originally be from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, was managing director of PECS Data Services in Mauritius. Stephen Littlechild, group managing director of PECS Data Services, paid tribute to ""wonderful"" Ms Farman who was ""brutally murdered"". ""In view of these tragic events, we have decided to close our Mauritius office today, so we can make sure all our team have access to counsellors and as a mark of respect to a wonderful lady,"" he said. ""Our thoughts are with Janice's family, friends and colleagues."" Another colleague, who did not want to be named, said: ""She is the most kind-hearted lady I have met in my life. She would never hesitate to offer her help as and when needed. ""As a friend, she would help me every time I would be in distress."" A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are assisting the family of a British woman following her death in Mauritius and are in contact with the local authorities."""
2017-07-08,"Mike Ashley arrived at court wearing a black suit, white shirt and black tie, and then spent the afternoon talking about a rival called Mr Blue.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170708150945/http://news.sky.com/story/court-case-sheds-light-on-the-world-of-mike-ashley-10938378,"It was rather as if Reservoir Dogs had come to the High Court, but with a focus on booze and business instead of guns and violence. Mr Ashley spent the morning listening intently, as he has for most of this case. As luck would have it, I sat almost directly behind him in Court 26, watching him fiddle with his tie, yawn occasionally and share a word with his lawyer, Justin Barnes. But mostly, he listened to the testimony of the bankers with whom he'd shared a pub. Mr Ashley was prepared. He brought in the following: a spiral-bound notebook, two blue biros, two highlighters (one yellow, one orange), two packs of post-it notes and his spectacles. Over the course of nearly three hours, I didn't see him make a single note. :: Mike Ashley tells court: I'm no Obi-Wan Kenobi He also had two bottles of mineral water and a small Nokia mobile phone. I know he has a Nokia because he later revealed that he favours one particular model. When I looked it up, the model was described as being a rather unexceptional, and not very smart, budget design, but Mr Ashley doesn't mind. He has a box of them that once contained 50 handsets, but now has only half as many. ""Periodically I lose, destroy, damage or have my phone stolen,"" he told the court. ""Whatever happens to a mobile phone happens to mine."" He doesn't need a very smart phone because it turns out he only reads a few of the emails that are sent to him. And he doesn't send any in return. For all the intricacies of his legal dispute with Mr Blue - which largely boils down to whether pub chat is legally enforceable - the greatest attraction of Mr Ashley's testimony was watching him in action. A self-made retail genius worth more than £2bn, but who often appears tetchy, confrontational and slightly awkward in public. And so it was in court. It didn't take long before the probing of Jeffrey Chapman QC began to annoy him. Mr Ashley began to speak slowly and deliberately, as if addressing a very small child, before his temper rose. ""Are you trying to be funny?"" he asked the barrister at one point, who simply glanced up in answer. He later answered a single ""no"" to about a dozen questions in a row, but on other occasions he could barely stop talking, saying that he wanted ""to add colour"" to the debate. Take this - on the subject of Sports Direct's share price - could it be easily manipulated? Mr Ashley held his face in his hands, his spectacles propped up on top of his head, and took in a big breath. ""The City is full of clever people,"" he said, ""and it's all about the numbers."" For numbers, read financial results. ""If I've got good numbers I could turn up at a party naked and it wouldn't matter, the share price would go up. ""If I have bad numbers, then it doesn't matter if I sign up for a monastery. The share price would go down."" He swore several times, held his head in his hands another few times, but also earned a few laughs from the court. Having described the flotation of Sports Direct as ""an unmitigated disaster"", Mr Ashley (who made more than £900m from the deal) admitted that he had already been ""fabulously wealthy"", but said money had not stopped his ambition. ""What do you think I do when I get up in the morning? Just go and buy the neighbour's house?"" He paused before adding: ""I already own it."" This whole case has revolved around questions over drinking, and this was no exception. Mr Ashley said it wasn't true that he made all his business decisions while drinking ""otherwise I'd live in a pub"", but did say that he happily held management meetings in a hotel where he would have four beers before eating, and then another two - or half a bottle of wine - with the meal. He repeatedly claimed to the court that Mr Blue was ""a liar"", but was also hard on himself. ""I am as fat as a pig,"" said Mr Ashley at one point. And in his closing words of the day, he seemed almost wistful. He said people wanted him to go to thousands of ""things"" but he always advised his team ""don't roll me out"". ""I know how disappointing it is when they actually meet me,"" said Mr Ashley. ""It is a let down. They think 'Jesus, I thought I was going to meet a bright bloke'."" And with that, the day came to an end. Mr Ashley collected his pad, his pens and his budget phone and headed out. I suspect he may have gone for a pint."

Two Americans, aged 35 and 29, also suffered slight injuries. ""A Spaniard from the Navarro region... is in a serious condition and two Americans (are) in a less serious condition,"" the festival said in a statement. A Red Cross spokesman said more runners were treated at the scene for bruises after two of the animals separated from the other four in the pack as they made their way to Pamplona's bullring. They completed the 850m course on the cobbled streets in just under three minutes - a speed considered average for the run. The bulls running on Friday came from the Cebada Gago ranch, whose animals have gored 53 people since they first took part in 1985. Ernest Hemingway immortalised the nine-day San Fermin fiesta - which has its origins in the Middle Ages - in his 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. Fifteen people have died in the bull runs since 1911, with the last fatality occurring in 2009."

""As is normal procedure, all charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service."" The threats are understood to be sexually explicit and of a violent nature. The Democratic Unionist Party is currently supporting Theresa May's minority government at Westminster. Mrs Foster visited Downing Street twice to negotiate a £1.5bn 'confidence and supply' deal with the Conservatives. Earlier this week, she expressed regret that her party and Sinn Fein had not yet reached agreement to restore devolved government at Stormont. Mrs Foster has been DUP leader for 18 months and served as Northern Ireland's First Minister for a year from January 2016."
2017-07-08,"Deliveroo has become the first major company in the so-called gig economy to offer benefits such as sick pay, as long as the law allows its riders to maintain their flexible working status.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170708150945/http://news.sky.com/story/deliveroo-seeks-law-change-to-allow-sick-pay-and-other-benefits-10940255,"In a submission to a Government review, due to report next week, the company's founder argues the rules need to keep pace with the evolving on-demand sector. Currently, riders do not receive benefits such as sick pay and insurance as they are classed as self-employed. Changing their employment status would give them benefits but would rob them, Deliveroo argues, of the right to work flexibly and for other companies. Chief executive Will Shu said: ""When I founded Deliveroo four years ago, I was the only rider delivering to customers all over London. ""I still do deliveries every week so I know better than anyone the hard work that Deliveroo riders put in every day. It's only right that they're given the security they deserve whilst keeping the flexibility that they value. ""The on-demand economy has changed the way people work and live. We want an environment in which both workers and businesses benefit from the opportunities these changes provide."" The rights of workers and responsibilities of gig economy firms are the main focus of the review, ordered a year ago, being led by the head of the Royal Society of Arts Matthew Taylor, a former policy chief for Tony Blair. Critics have accused Deliveroo and rivals such as Uber of shirking financial and social responsibilities as employers. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""This reads like special pleading. ""There's nothing stopping Deliveroo from paying their workforce the minimum wage and guaranteeing them basic rights like holiday and sick pay. ""Plenty of employers are able to provide genuine flexibility and security for their workforce. Deliveroo have no excuse for not following suit. ""The company's reluctance to offer benefits now is because they want to dodge wider employment and tax obligations by labelling staff as self-employed."" Mr Taylor's review is expected to be published next week."
2017-07-08,Mike Pence became the butt of an internet joke after his visit to NASA - but he seemed to be laughing too.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170708150945/http://news.sky.com/story/us-vice-president-mike-pence-mocks-his-own-nasa-blunder-10941280,"The US Vice President visited Cape Canaveral in Florida and could not resist touching what was labelled as ""critical space flight hardware"". He appeared completely oblivious to a sign just above his hand that said, in red capital letters: do not touch. But it was too late: the moment Mr Pence let his curiosity get the better of him, the cameras clicked away and a mini sensation had been created. The Twittersphere criticised him, with one person describing him as having the ""self control of a sugar-charged 3rd grader on a field trip"". Another told him he ""should be an example"". Sorry @NASA...@MarcoRubio dared me to do it! pic.twitter.com/qIYtKOPyFh Mr Pence tweeted on Friday to apologise to NASA, joking that Senator Marco Rubio, who had visited the space agency with him, had ""dared me to do it"". Just to make it extra clear, he drew a red circle around the head of Mr Rubio, who had been standing behind him in the photo. The tweet got him more than 3,000 re-tweets and 10,000 likes. Mr Rubio, for his part, replied to Mr Pence's tweet with: ""In fairness, I warned (the Vice President) that 'you break it, you own it'."" In fairness, I warned @VP that ""you break it, you own it"" https://t.co/X5ROcnDVCd But Mr Pence wasn't quite finished. He - or perhaps a staffer - loaded up some photo-editing software and replaced the piece of Orion with a porcupine, tweeting the picture with a caption: ""Okay...so this isn't exactly the first time this has happened."" Okay...so this isn't exactly the first time this has happened. pic.twitter.com/6Y7b3UlJXe The NASA Twitter account graciously accepted Mr Pence's apology and said that the hardware - which is part of a spacecraft-in-the-making called the Orion - needed to be cleaned, anyway. ""It was OK to touch the surface,"" they added. ""It was an honor to host you!"" It was OK to touch the surface. Those are just day-to-day reminder signs. We were going to clean it anyway. It was an honor to host you! https://t.co/gu8zxknsJv In a statement, NASA spokesperson Jen Rae Wang said: ""The signs are there as a day-to-day reminder, including the one visible on the titanium Forward Bay Cover for the Orion spacecraft. ""Procedures require the hardware to be cleaned before tiles are bonded to the spacecraft, so touching the surface is absolutely okay. ""Otherwise, the hardware would have had a protective cover over it like the thermal heat shield, which was nearby."" Mr Pence has not exactly been famous for his sense of humour - he is better known for being very straight-laced and conservative. But, then again, when asked in 2012 to name the biggest misconception that people have about him, his reply was: ""That I dye my hair...and that I don't have a sense of humour""."

It appeared routine for Andy Murray as the defending champion took the first set against the 28th seed Fabio Fognini. But it felt as though the crowd wanted a battle, and the Italian provided it, winning the second set. Murray took the third, but an often tetchy match became seriously heated in the fourth when Fognini was docked a point for a visible obscenity - he put a finger in his mouth. The angrier the better for the Italian, it seemed, as he raced into 5-2 lead. It seemed we were heading for a fifth set under the lights with a closed roof, and Murray admitted afterwards he was thinking about that. Happily for his dodgy hip, he recovered to win the set and earn himself a meeting on Monday with Frenchman Benoit Paire. ""I didn't feel like I moved particularly well,"" said Murray. ""I don't know if that was anything to do with my hip or not."" By contrast, his female counterpart as British number one Jo Konta enjoyed a smooth, business-like victory over world number 101 Maria Sakkari of Greece. Her next opponent, Caroline Garcia of France, narrowly won their last encounter, but with the crowd here increasingly growing to love her, Konta can be optimistic of reaching her first Wimbledon quarter-final. Two years on from her glorious failure against Serena Williams on the first Friday of Wimbledon, Heather Watson won the opening set against former world number one Victoria Azarenka, but the Belarusian proved too strong. Watson said she was ""gutted"", but her exploits this week have returned her to the world's top 100 and gained her direct entry into next month's US Open. Having met Gilles Muller in a sushi bar in Wimbledon village the previous evening, Aljaz Bedene was sent crashing out of the tournament by the 16th seed from Luxembourg. The British number four is already targeting a climb into the world's top 30 by the end of the year, and a seeding for the Australian Open in January. Murray and Konta have their sights on more immediate targets. Could they possibly both be champions on Sunday week? ""No I haven't thought about it,"" said Konta. ""If it were to happen it'd be amazing."""

Neighbours said a Libyan family lived at the address. Twenty-three people have now been arrested over the 22 May suicide bombing - two were quickly de-arrested and 20 others were released without charge. Salman Abedi's attack killed 22 people as crowds streamed out of an Ariana Grande concert. Police said earlier this week that they still want to speak to Abedi's brother and that they believe ""other people"" may have been involved. Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson said he did not believe it was a ""large network"" that was involved in the bombing. ""We don't have evidence that there were other suicide bombers, we do suspect others were aware or complicit in their knowledge of the attack,"" he said. ""We do believe there may be other arrests in the future."" Three million files and 16,000 hours of CCTV have been collected as police have sought to detail Abedi's movements in the days and weeks before the attack, and establish any terrorist connections he may have had."

""Two international hospitals and their researchers have communicated to us as late as the last 24 hours that they have fresh evidence about their proposed experimental treatment. ""And we believe, in common with Charlie's parents, it is right to explore this evidence."" Researchers at the Vatican children's hospital have sent a letter urging Charlie's doctors to reconsider an experimental treatment. They said there had been ""dramatic clinical improvements"" in people and mice with a condition similar - though not the same - to Charlie's. An American hospital has offered to bring an experimental drug to the UK to treat him.

She said: ""I promise everyone I would not sit there and watch my son in pain and suffering, I couldn't do it.""

It said the ruling had been ""supported unequivocally by some of the world's most distinguished clinicians and scientists"". The hospital described Charlie's condition as ""exceptionally rare, with catastrophic and irreversible brain damage"". It added: ""Our doctors have explored every medical treatment, including experimental nucleoside therapies. ""Independent medical experts agreed with our clinical team that this treatment would be unjustified. ""Not only that, but they said it would be futile and would prolong Charlie's suffering. This is not an issue about money or resources, but absolutely about what is right for Charlie. ""Our view has not changed. We believe it is right to seek the High Court's view in light of the claimed new evidence."" A family spokesperson said: ""The decision by Great Ormond St Hospital to apply for a fresh hearing in the High Court regarding their son Charlie marks the end of an extremely traumatic and distressing week for his parents and the rest of his family. ""Connie and Chris are like any loving parents. They have always put Charlie's needs first and will continue to do so as they only want the very best for him. ""They are optimistic their son will soon get the treatment he needs and want to thank those people from around the world who've sent them so many moving and touching messages of support."""

Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia in Canada, blamed the declining size on climate change, as this is reducing the level of oxygen in the ocean. Speaking at the 50th Anniversary Symposium of the Fisheries Society of the British Isles at the University of Exeter, Dr Cheung said fish struggled to find enough oxygen to breathe as the ocean temperatures rose. Fish more easily become ""out of breath"" as they grow larger. Cod is one of the fish types that could also be forced north in search of colder water, something that would benefit Arctic fisheries such as those in Canada, Russia and Norway. But we would be left with fish more commonly found off Spain and Portugal and our fish and chips could soon be made with sea bass or anchovies. But there is still time to preserve our national dish, as Dr Cheung said that efforts to reduce the impact of climate change and conservation programmes could still make a big difference. He said: ""International actions in achieving the Paris Agreement will benefit Britain's fisheries by substantially reducing climate impacts on fish stocks. ""At the same time, local actions that improve the health of fish stocks, and protecting their critical habitats, can also reduce help moderate climate impacts on the fisheries."""

The 23-year-old was arrested after the disturbance, which forced the plane to return to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. He did not speak during the hearing and his lawyer, Robert Flennaugh, refused to comment. Hudek was charged with interfering with a flight crew, which carries a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 (£195,000) fine, and is expected to remain in custody until a detention hearing on 13 July. The court heard a flight attendant and a passenger were taken to hospital with severe facial injuries following the incident. FBI special agent Caryn Highley said Hudek was sitting in the first row of the first-class section of the plane. He asked a flight attendant for a beer before the plane took off and was served one but did not show any signs of being drunk and ordered no other alcoholic drinks, the court heard. But about an hour into the flight, as the plane was over the Pacific Ocean northwest of Vancouver Island, Hudek went into a toilet, came out quickly, asked the attendant a question and then went back in, the agent said. Ms Highley said that when he came out again about two minutes later, Hudek suddenly lunged for the exit door, grabbed the handle and tried to open it. He was grabbed by two attendants but pushed them away, the court heard. Hudek allegedly punched one flight attendant twice in the face and struck at least one passenger in the head with a wine bottle. Another flight attendant grabbed two wine bottles and hit him over the head with each, breaking at least one of them, the court was told. One flight attendant said in a statement: ""Hudek did not seem impacted by the breaking of a full litre red wine bottle over his head, and instead shouted, 'do you know who I am?' or something to that extent."" A passenger got Hudek in a headlock but he managed to free himself, Ms Highley said, before several passengers held him long enough to place zip-tie restraints on him. Passenger Dustin Jones said he saw a man being rolled into the terminal in a wheelchair after the plane landed. Mr Jones said: ""He started yelling for help. And so he turned the wheelchair over in the middle of the airport, screaming for people to help him, just being belligerent."""
2017-07-08,"With Volvo's announcement that the company is turning to only electric and hybrid engines in its new models from 2019, the industry is taking stock of how the energy network could cope with an influx of electric cars.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170708150945/http://news.sky.com/story/is-uk-really-ready-for-electric-car-revolution-10939780,"The uptake of electric or partly electric cars is already increasing at an impressive rate. Last year the number of registered vehicles rose by more than 50%. But that's still only around 100,000 - out of around 30 million cars in the country. Volvo has bet big that this will change fast. Philip New from Energy Systems Catapult says in the short term our energy grid should cope, but there could be problems. ""The likely pace of growth is something that the system can absorb for the next few years,"" he said. ""The caveat there is that if there's clustering where too many people in one street are trying to charge their electric cars at the same time, that could cause a problem for the low voltage network and cause localised blackouts. ""In the future, if we get to penetrations of electric cars that are in the 60, 70, 80% range of take-up, that becomes part of the overall transformation of the energy system that needs looking at."" Nothing is unfixable, but it will cost money. For example, putting in a thicker or entirely new cable down a cul-de-sac where a lot of residents have electric cars could cost tens of thousands of pounds. The question is who will pay for that? Other solutions could be to install smart systems either in cars or in homes that help coordinate the charging of vehicles around peak times in the day and night. In a statement, National Grid said: ""The predicted growth of electric vehicles represents an exciting opportunity and we believe this emerging trend can play a major role in helping the UK to meet its green energy targets. ""This will require investment in electricity network infrastructure and we are already planning for the impact of mass adoption of electric vehicles."" Some put the price of completely future-proofing the network at well over £2bn. The Government has promised hundreds of millions of pounds but more will be needed if the commercial sector can't foot the bill. Another potential block is the availability of charging pumps out on the road. 'Range anxiety' is often quoted as a major problem for people considering going electric. The Government has gone for the 'stick' approach here, hinting in the Queen's Speech that service stations and petrol forecourts will need to install electric pumps as standard. Ecotricty's Dale Vince is the founder of the largest charger network in the country. He's taken years to get it to the stage of having hundreds of pumps around the country - but he knows there's far more to do and is investing millions in new super-fast chargers capable of charging the latest cars in just 15 minutes. ""We used the available grid capacity at these motorway service stations, so to put in the high powered chargers next year we'll have to bring in a new grid connection and sub stations. And because we're putting in bays of six to eight at a time, we're talking a megawatt or two of power so that's a big step up."" Even traditional fuel suppliers like oil giant Shell are making moves in the area. Shell director John Abbott said: ""We already have plans to install electric charge points at three of our stations in September and plans to roll out 10 by the end of 2017. ""We expect, by 2025, 20% of our fuels margins to come from these low carbon energy sources."" It seems Volvo isn't the only company convinced that going electric is not just good for the environment, but good for business too."

The guest list for the informal summit is understood to include Carolyn McCall of Easyjet, who backed the Remain campaign and is already establishing a new base for the business in Europe; Tesco boss Dave Lewis; and Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT. The meeting will pile more pressure onto Mr Davis after a high-profile intervention from the CBI, whose director general Carolyn Fairbairn last night called for ministers to make an open-ended transitional deal with the EU to protect businesses. This would mean Britain staying in the single market and customs union potentially for several years beyond March 2019 while the terms of such a deal with the other 27 countries are finalised. Brexit-sceptic business leaders feel emboldened by the election result - and support from Chancellor Philip Hammond to avoid a ""cliff edge"" - to be more forthright in calling for a soft Brexit. The summit, expected to be a frank exchange of views, comes amid criticism of Theresa May's government for failing to engage with business since she became Prime Minister. Representatives from the CBI and manufacturers' organisation EEF will also be at Chevening. Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange - who is fighting to keep London as the hub for euro clearing - is also reported to be attending. Alison Brittain, who runs Costa Coffee and Whitbread, the owner of Premier Inn hotels, will also be in attendance, with future migration from the EU likely to be on her agenda. David Cameron used to meet with a panel of business leaders at Downing Street regularly, but this was disbanded by Mrs May. Following criticism, Mr Davis has now set up an EU Exit Business Advisory Group, which is due to meet once a fortnight with the Chancellor and Business Secretary. In a speech at the London School of Economics yesterday, Ms Fairbairn made the most outspoken intervention yet by the business group, saying that reaching a final deal before March 2019 would be ""impossible"" and calling for a transition period. Britain would be unable to strike trade deals outside the EU during this period. She said: ""Even with the greatest possible goodwill on both sides, it's impossible to imagine the detail will be clear by the end of March 2019. This is a time to be realistic. ""Our proposal is for the UK to seek to stay in the single market and a customs union until a final deal is in force. ""The prospect of multiple cliff edges - in tariffs, red tape and regulation - is already casting a long shadow over business decisions."" Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEG, said: ""The brinkmanship involved in taking Brexit negotiations to the line, while leaving businesses guessing about the likely outcome, risks causing serious economic damage."""

Ministry of Justice figures showed 225kg of drugs were recovered across the prison estate in England and Wales in 2016. The ministry said seizing mobiles and sim cards helps to stop inmates continuing to plot further crimes from behind bars. The Government said a £2m investment in technology to detect phones and 300 specialist dogs trained to find drugs had helped recover the illegal items. Mr Gyimah admitted more needed to be done to tackle the problem and that there was a need to recruit more prison officers. He said: ""I have been clear that the current levels of violence, drugs and mobile phones in our prisons is unacceptable. ""We have put in place a number of measures to help disrupt this illegal activity as it is an issue I am absolutely determined to resolve.

""The issues within our prisons will not be resolved overnight, but we must make progress in tackling these problems. Bringing in more frontline staff is an integral part of that.

Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell has played down reports in a number of Sunday newspapers that he made the comments at a private dinner on 26 June, the day Mrs May struck a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. A Conservative MP present at the gathering told the Mail on Sunday: ""Mr Mitchell effectively said she was dead in the water. ""He said she was weak, had lost her authority, couldn't go on and we needed a new leader. Some of us were very surprised and disagreed with him."" But Mr Mitchell told Sky News this was an ""overheated report of a private dinner conversation"". When asked whether Mrs May should resign, he did not answer the question. The Sutton Coldfield MP is an ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is seen as a potential successor to Mrs May, and ran his friend's failed 2005 leadership bid. Mr Mitchell, who resigned as chief whip after swearing at a police officer at the gates of Downing Street in the ""Plebgate"" affair, did not mention Mr Davis in his comments at the One Nation Commons dining club of Tory MPs, of which he is the secretary. Responding to the story, Mr Lidington said: ""There's always in July a lot of gossip - hot weather, people going to rather too many summer parties for their own good, and you get this sort of silly story. ""What I see with the Prime Minister and my Cabinet colleagues is a Government that's knuckling down to work, that's saying look, the public gave us the election result, we have to live with that, make adjustments to that. ""But there's big problems out there; the impact of digital technology on our economy, how we reform and fund our public services in the future, how we deal with a huge generational issue like social care. ""I think the public want the Government to be getting on with that. ""Self-indulgent gossip really doesn't help anybody. We need to get the job done."" He denied the PM had lost her authority, saying: ""I see somebody who is very determined to lead and get on with the job."""

Yes, it's difficult to fit the tours into the crowded season of the professional game. But it's only every four years, and football manages to adjust its domestic seasons to accommodate World Cups. The rugby has been gripping, the concept is special and the 2017 tourists have been exemplary in fulfilling their off-field duties as well. :: The Coach knows what he's doing Warren Gatland has copped plenty of flak for not picking enough Scots, choosing too many Welsh players and sticking with trusted old hands for too long. A draw in the home of the mighty All Blacks, coupled with the victory he guided the Lions to in Australia four years ago, should be answer enough. Once you've chosen your coach, you have to back him to select players as he sees fit. The proof of Gatland's pudding was in the performances and the results. :: No more draws The 15-all draw in the final test made dramatic viewing, but we should respect the players. Both captains called it an anti-climax. So we should look carefully at ideas for settling a draw in future. Carry on after the final hooter until someone scores, or play perhaps 20 minutes of extra time. It works in the World Cup - ask Sir Clive Woodward's England winners from 2003. :: You need a big squad One thing Gatland might accept he misjudged was the controversial call-up mid-tour of six players from Wales and Scotland, not on the basis of ability but because they happened to be on tour with their respective countries in the right time zone and could get involved quickly. They played little or no part, the coach saying he didn't want to cheapen the Lions' famous red jersey. If the answer is to make the squad even bigger (it was 41 at the outset this time), so be it. :: New Zealand is still the king of rugby Yes it was a draw, but deep down the Lions know that, if New Zealand hadn't botched an improbable number of try-scoring chances and missed too many kicks at goal, the outcome could have been very different. As befits a country where rugby is close to a religion, the All Blacks have a seemingly endless conveyor belt of replacements for ageing legends. Only the brave would bet against them for the next World Cup in Japan in 2019. Mind you, England coach Eddie Jones IS a brave man."

Defoe, who played for Bradley's beloved Sunderland until the end of the season, struck up a close bond with him. Writing on Twitter, Defoe said: ""Goodbye my friend gonna miss u lots. ""I feel so blessed God brought u into my life and had some amazing moments with u and for that I'm so grateful."" As a mascot for Sunderland and England, Bradley won the hearts of thousands of football fans around the world. On Friday evening, his life was celebrated with a minute's applause at Sunderland's pre-season friendly at Bury. The tribute was held before kick-off, with Bury tweeting later: ""Result means nothing, it's all about Bradley Lowery this evening - condolences from all at Bury FC to the Lowery family #buryfc #ripbradley"". Bradley died at home in Blackhall, County Durham, in his parents' arms and surrounded by his family.

2017-07-09,"Lib Dem Sir Vince Cable has said he is ""beginning to think Brexit may never happen"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170709151646/http://news.sky.com/story/lib-dem-sir-vince-cable-brexit-may-never-happen-10942299,"Sir Vince, who is likely to become his party's next leader, said: ""The problems are so enormous, the divisions within the two major parties are enormous. ""I can see a scenario in which this doesn't happen."" The former Cabinet minister said the Lib Dems' policy of having a second referendum on the final exit deal - with the choice of staying in the EU on the ballot paper - was ""designed to give a way out when it becomes clear that Brexit is potentially disastrous"". Theresa May's Brexit approach - which includes leaving the customs union and single market and prioritising controlling immigration - has been called into question after she lost her majority in the General Election. Critics, and some within her own party, have called for the Prime Minister to moderate her approach and prioritise avoiding a ""cliff edge"" for businesses when Brexit takes effect. In the wake of the result, a number of senior European figures have said Britain is welcome to change its mind on Brexit. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, said the UK could stay, but only on poorer terms. French President Emmanuel Macron said the ""door remains open"" until negotiations end. Sir Vince, who is the only candidate to replace Tim Farron as Lib Dem leader, said Brexit offered the party an opportunity. He acknowledged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had a good election, but ""there is an element of bubble about it"" because ""actually he is very pro-Brexit, and a hard Brexit, and when that becomes apparent the divisions in the Labour Party will become more real and the opportunity for us to move into that space will be substantial"". ""There is an imminent issue, which is whether the Government continues to pursue the so-called hard Brexit - leaving the customs union and single market,"" Sir Vince told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""We have got to work with other people, we did last week, there was a motion in Parliament led by some Labour MPs we supported, to try to head of that disastrous outcome."" ""If the economy suffers, people will reconsider Brexit and ""the whole question of continued membership will once again arise"". Sir Vince has been criticised for claiming the PM's rhetoric on ""citizens of nowhere"" was like something from Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf. He admitted he had compared Mrs May to the wrong dictator: ""I got my literary reference wrong - I think it was (Soviet leader Joseph) Stalin who talked about 'rootless' cosmopolitans'."""

A statement from the Beverly Hills Police Department said the Belgian international has been ordered to appear at a court in Los Angeles on 2 October. But Sky's Nick Powell said there was a possibility the player could be ""legally represented"", meaning he may be able to avoid appearing in person. Police said: ""On July 2 2017, at approximately 8pm, Beverly Hills Police Department officers arrested a 24-year-old male subject by the name of Romelu Lukaku Bolingoli. ""Bolingoli received a misdemeanour citation for Beverly Hills Municipal Code Violation 5-1-104 - Excessive Noise."" Police added: ""The citation was issued after officers responded to five other noise complaints from the same location, which resulted in verbal warnings. ""These noise violations occurred at a residence in Beverly Hills where Bolingoli was temporarily residing. ""Bolingoli was released at the scene with the citation and was not physically arrested."" On Tuesday, Lukaku posted a picture on Instagram of him in LA with Manchester United player Paul Pogba, and NBA basketball player Serge Ibaka. The striker notched up 25 goals last season and was the second-highest scorer in the Premier League."
2017-07-09,"Mike Ashley arrived at court wearing a black suit, white shirt and black tie, and then spent the afternoon talking about a rival called Mr Blue.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170709151646/http://news.sky.com/story/court-case-sheds-light-on-the-world-of-mike-ashley-10938378,"It was rather as if Reservoir Dogs had come to the High Court, but with a focus on booze and business instead of guns and violence. Mr Ashley spent the morning listening intently, as he has for most of this case. As luck would have it, I sat almost directly behind him in Court 26, watching him fiddle with his tie, yawn occasionally and share a word with his lawyer, Justin Barnes. But mostly, he listened to the testimony of the bankers with whom he'd shared a pub. Mr Ashley was prepared. He brought in the following: a spiral-bound notebook, two blue biros, two highlighters (one yellow, one orange), two packs of post-it notes and his spectacles. Over the course of nearly three hours, I didn't see him make a single note. :: Mike Ashley tells court: I'm no Obi-Wan Kenobi He also had two bottles of mineral water and a small Nokia mobile phone. I know he has a Nokia because he later revealed that he favours one particular model. When I looked it up, the model was described as being a rather unexceptional, and not very smart, budget design, but Mr Ashley doesn't mind. He has a box of them that once contained 50 handsets, but now has only half as many. ""Periodically I lose, destroy, damage or have my phone stolen,"" he told the court. ""Whatever happens to a mobile phone happens to mine."" He doesn't need a very smart phone because it turns out he only reads a few of the emails that are sent to him. And he doesn't send any in return. For all the intricacies of his legal dispute with Mr Blue - which largely boils down to whether pub chat is legally enforceable - the greatest attraction of Mr Ashley's testimony was watching him in action. A self-made retail genius worth more than £2bn, but who often appears tetchy, confrontational and slightly awkward in public. And so it was in court. It didn't take long before the probing of Jeffrey Chapman QC began to annoy him. Mr Ashley began to speak slowly and deliberately, as if addressing a very small child, before his temper rose. ""Are you trying to be funny?"" he asked the barrister at one point, who simply glanced up in answer. He later answered a single ""no"" to about a dozen questions in a row, but on other occasions he could barely stop talking, saying that he wanted ""to add colour"" to the debate. Take this - on the subject of Sports Direct's share price - could it be easily manipulated? Mr Ashley held his face in his hands, his spectacles propped up on top of his head, and took in a big breath. ""The City is full of clever people,"" he said, ""and it's all about the numbers."" For numbers, read financial results. ""If I've got good numbers I could turn up at a party naked and it wouldn't matter, the share price would go up. ""If I have bad numbers, then it doesn't matter if I sign up for a monastery. The share price would go down."" He swore several times, held his head in his hands another few times, but also earned a few laughs from the court. Having described the flotation of Sports Direct as ""an unmitigated disaster"", Mr Ashley (who made more than £900m from the deal) admitted that he had already been ""fabulously wealthy"", but said money had not stopped his ambition. ""What do you think I do when I get up in the morning? Just go and buy the neighbour's house?"" He paused before adding: ""I already own it."" This whole case has revolved around questions over drinking, and this was no exception. Mr Ashley said it wasn't true that he made all his business decisions while drinking ""otherwise I'd live in a pub"", but did say that he happily held management meetings in a hotel where he would have four beers before eating, and then another two - or half a bottle of wine - with the meal. He repeatedly claimed to the court that Mr Blue was ""a liar"", but was also hard on himself. ""I am as fat as a pig,"" said Mr Ashley at one point. And in his closing words of the day, he seemed almost wistful. He said people wanted him to go to thousands of ""things"" but he always advised his team ""don't roll me out"". ""I know how disappointing it is when they actually meet me,"" said Mr Ashley. ""It is a let down. They think 'Jesus, I thought I was going to meet a bright bloke'."" And with that, the day came to an end. Mr Ashley collected his pad, his pens and his budget phone and headed out. I suspect he may have gone for a pint."
2017-07-09,"As UK authorities continue to evaluate the risks posed by sinister ""games"" such as Blue Whale, Russian families say the risks are real and they want the world to know the price they have paid.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170709151646/http://news.sky.com/story/blue-whale-death-game-leaves-a-trail-of-misery-for-russian-families-10942187,"Blue Whale is a teenage suicide challenge or ""death group"" that began in Russia several years ago. Within such groups, anonymous organisers encourage participants to kill themselves after the completion of a set number of tasks. Civil society groups in Russia believe that at least 130 young people have taken their lives while playing Blue Whale, while reports of incidents and fatalities in places such as Ukraine, Estonia, Kenya, Brazil and Argentina have also surfaced in recent months. The name Blue Whale may come from a song by Russian rock band Lumen called Burn. There is a ""huge blue whale"" that ""can't break through the net"", they sing. ""Why scream / when no one hears / what we're talking about?"" What is certain, safety campaigners say, is that thousands of young Russians have tried to play it. Sky News met an amiable, first-year university student called Oleg Kapaev, who told us that he started playing Blue Whale because he was curious and bored. He said: ""I was sceptical about it, I couldn't believe anyone could actually kill themselves by playing it. Because I didn't believe it I guess, I decided to look for it."" Oleg said it took several days of online investigation to find a Blue Whale group. ""There are a lot of groups on the internet but when I found the one called #(name withheld), I started playing for real. There was a link to their website, I registered and that was it. You just start waiting for the tasks."" An administrator gave him instructions like: ""tell how me how you want to die"" and ""watch horror films all night"". Later the tasks became more grotesque. The college student was told to cut patterns in his skin symbolising ""the pathway to the end"" and Oleg did exactly as he was told, posting a photo of his bloodied arm online as proof. ""They start psychologically manipulating you. It is very professionally done. You become a bit of a zombie."" Typically, Blue Whale participants are given 50 tasks but Oleg was told that he was a better ""player"" than the others and that he would become ""happier faster"" when he completed task number nine: ""jump from the top of a 20-storey building in Moscow"". Sleep deprived and disorientated, the 20-year old prepared to carry it out. ""I didn't feel like I needed to kill myself,"" he said. ""I felt I needed to complete the task. I only had this thought in my head - that I need to complete the task."" It was the young man's parents who would ultimately save his life. When they discovered he had bought a plane ticket to Moscow - and saw a collection of suicide-obsessed comments on his social media page, they called the police. An officer managed to track him down and detain him before he jumped. Oleg's mother Olga, told Sky News that they were lucky. ""It's not a game, it's a game of death,"" she said. ""Some people will survive but other people will not. It is like gambling. That's it."" Sergey and Larisa Pestov were less fortunate. Last year, their 16-year-old daughter Diana died after falling from the roof of a block of flats in a city called Ryazan. Several weeks later, they found out that she - and a number of classmates - had been participating in an online ""group of death"". Determined to do something about the phenomenon, the couple founded an online safety organisation which now claims more than 800 active volunteers. Together, they try to monitor online discussions groups and alert the authorities when they spot vulnerable teenagers online. Still, it is not easy to help those who desperately need it, said a tearful Mr Pestov. ""The parents will always blame themselves that maybe they did not give their children enough love or understanding. ""But it was impossible for us to understand what was happening at that time - to know the child was being pressured. ""They are made to hide everything from their parents."" The Russian authorities have made two arrests in connection with these online suicide challenges. A 21-year-old, who reportedly confessed to inciting 16 participants to kill themselves, was arrested last November while a 26-year-old Moscow-based postman was detained earlier this month. Both men are expected to face trial. It is difficult to measure the real impact of Blue Whale in Russia. The country's teenage suicide rate has risen sharply to 720 in 2016 from 461 in the previous year but experts point to a range of factors, such as lack of opportunity, alcoholism and mental health issues by means of explanation. Nonetheless, people like the Pestovs are convinced that internet-based suicide ""games"" have had a profound influence on that tragic statistic and they want to world to know about the dangers online. :: If you feel affected by the issues in this article, click here to contact the Samaritans in the UK or call 116 123."

Reid, of Berryfields Road, Sutton Coldfield, then used a gold engagement ring stolen in the burglary to propose to a woman on Christmas Eve. The woman later tipped off detectives after recognising the jewellery in a police appeal. Jones, of Oak Close, Rubery, in Worcestershire, was caught on CCTV in a jewellery shop in Birmingham Road the morning after the raid, trying to sell items including a signet ring, watch and bracelet that belonged to the victim's late husband. The store turned him away but his friend Christopher Rowland, 40, returned later the same day and exchanged the valuables for cash. Reid's DNA was found at the scene of the burglary on a chisel that he had used to prise out a glass door pane. He was jailed for four years and nine months at Birmingham Crown Court after being found guilty of burglary, while Jones was sentenced to four years and three months. Rowland, of Mount View, Erdington, in Birmingham, was given a 12-month community order and a conditional discharge for handling stolen goods. Detective Sergeant Tom Lyons, from West Midlands Police, said: ""The victim was unhurt but this was clearly a shocking ordeal for her. She was awoken by a security light being activated and footsteps on the stairs and moments later they burst into her bedroom.

Witnesses told police they fought and Tidwell then got a gun from inside his home and began firing at Angel. He took a gun from his car and fired several rounds towards Tidwell's home, it was claimed. Most of the bullets went into the house and at least one struck the girl, according to police documents.

2017-07-09,London Fire Brigade has increased the number of crews it sends to blazes at high-rise flats following the Grenfell Tower tragedy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170709151646/http://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-tragedy-prompts-increase-in-crews-sent-to-high-rise-fires-10941588,"Fires at tower blocks will now see an aerial appliance automatically dispatched, the brigade said, following reports that a high ladder did not arrive at Grenfell until half-an-hour after the first crews were sent. The number of crews sent out immediately to high-rise incidents has also increased from four to five. More than 200 firefighters rescued 65 people from Grenfell Tower as the fire broke out on 14 June, with 40 fire engines sent to the scene. At least 80 people died in the tragedy. A London Fire Brigade spokeswoman said ""an interim change to predetermined attendance for high-rise buildings"" had been introduced ""in direct response to the Government's action to address concerns over cladding on buildings"". :: Jeremy Corbyn says Grenfell fire was a 'terrible consequence' of austerity The spokeswoman said that fires at high-rise buildings were ""nearly always dealt with internally, not usually needing an aerial appliance"". It comes after reports that an aerial appliance, or high ladder, did not arrive at the Grenfell scene until more than half-an-hour after the first fire crews were dispatched. It has also been claimed that firefighters have said they experienced problems with equipment and water pressure. A Thames Water spokesman said: ""Any suggestion there was low pressure or that Thames Water did not supply enough water to fire services during this appalling tragedy is categorically false."" A brigade spokeswoman said the investigation into the fire would examine the fire service's response. The brigade said an additional aerial ladder was sent from Surrey Fire and Rescue Service to assist in the effort but did not say what time its own first aerial ladder arrived. It said that due to the ongoing investigation it could not give much detail, but Commissioner Dany Cotton said she would ""fully review"" the brigade's resources. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he had asked Ms Cotton to undertake a review of what additional resources the brigade might need. Mr Khan told Sky News: ""It is essential that our fire service has the right tools to keep our city safe."" More than 200 buildings in 55 local authority areas have since failed combustibility tests implemented by the Government following the fire - a 100% failure rate. Further tests have been recommended by an independent expert safety panel to look at how different combinations of cladding panel and insulation types react in ""severe fire"" conditions."

The pupils caught up in the dual carriageway crash were from Year 9 and Year 12 at John Taylor High School in Barton-under-Needwood, near Burton-on-Trent. In a letter to parents, the headteacher explained there had been a fatal accident involving one of its Year 9 students and said it would offer support to any students struggling with the news. Residents have described hearing a ""massive bang"" before the arrival of emergency services at the scene, which was closed off. One said there were ""a lot of accidents here all the time, it's a busy road"". Police spokesman Superintendent Dean Hatton said: ""Unfortunately, it became clear nothing could be done at the scene to save the life of the young girl and she was pronounced dead at the scene.""

We feel that it should be our right as parents to decide to give him a chance at life."" ""There's nothing to lose, he deserves this chance."" She said they had received support from doctors from all over the world, as well as the UK. Ms Yates said the oral medicine they want for Charlie has an ""up to 10% chance of working"" and has ""no known major side effects"". Charlie's father, Chris Gard, said there is no evidence Charlie has ""catastrophic brain damage"" and added: ""He should have had this chance a long time ago now. ""They said that it wasn't fair to leave him on the ventilator for three months for a treatment they didn't think was going to work. ""He's now been left for seven months with no treatment."" Ms Yates added: ""If he's still fighting, we're still fighting."" Charlie's parents, from Bedfont in west London, joined a demonstration outside Great Ormond Street Hospital on Sunday. A petition of more than 350,000 signatures was delivered, calling on doctors to allow the 11-month-old to travel to the US for treatment after President Donald Trump tweeted an offer of help. Two American congressmen have added their support and are trying to offer the Gard family the chance to become US residents. Great Ormond Street Hospital said on Friday it had applied to the High Court for a fresh hearing ""in light of claims of new evidence relating to potential treatment for his condition"". Charlie's case will be heard by Mr Justice Francis on Monday. Also speaking outside the hospital, US lawyer Catherine Glenn Foster said: ""This new evidence involves the therapy itself and the percent success rate, and the likelihood that it will significantly help Charlie. ""That's a success rate of up to 10% according to one of the doctors who has worked on this, and a 50%-plus success rate of this treatment crossing the blood brain barrier. ""So a likelihood - a non-zero chance - and that's what the parents are looking for. They are looking for a chance for their son."" Charlie's mother has called on Theresa May to help, but Justice Secretary David Lidington told Sky News that although the case is ""heart-wrenching"" the Government has ""no role to play"". He said: ""It is right that judges interpret the law, independently and dispassionately. As ministers and as a Government we have no role to play in the Charlie Gard case, as would be the case in any other proceeding in court. ""I do not envy the judges who are having to take decisions on this."" Researchers at the Vatican's children's hospital have also offered assistance. They said tests in mice and patients, with a similar but not the same genetic condition as Charlie, had shown ""dramatic clinical improvements"". Charlie inherited the faulty RRM2B gene from his parents. It affects the cells responsible for energy production and respiration, leaving him unable to move or breathe without a ventilator. The therapy he has been offered is not a cure."

He has been one of United most prolific and successful players and last season broke Sir Bobby Charlton's record to become the club's leading goal-scorer and leaves Old Trafford with 253 United goals to his name. United manager Jose Mourinho said: ""It is no secret that I have long been an admirer of Wayne. He has been a model professional throughout his time at the club and will remain in the history books for many years to come. ""It is never easy to see a great player playing less football than he would like and I could not stand in his way when he asked to go back to Everton. His experience, focus and determination will be missed and I wish him well for the future."" Rooney began to fall down the pecking order at Old Trafford and last season his appearances totalled 15 Premier League starts He has been linked with moves to China and the US but when it emerged he would be leaving United, joining Everton became more appealing. When Rooney left Everton 13 years ago there was some resentment among fans but the player has never lost touch with his roots. Any animosity towards Rooney from Evertonians eased with time and he even played for the club again in Duncan Ferguson's testimonial in 2015. Rooney, also England's record goalscorer, will be joining a batch of new faces arriving at the club this summer, including Jordan Pickford, Davy Klaassen, Michael Keane, Henry Onyekuru, Nathangelo Markelo and Sandro Ramirezas new additions."

Green Day - the headliners at the Mad Cool festival in Madrid - are believed to have gone on stage afterwards without being told of the tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends After their Friday night gig they tweeted: ""We just got off stage at Mad Cool Festival to disturbing news. A very brave artist named Pedro lost his life tonight in a tragic accident. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends."" Event organisers said they decided not to cancel the rock group's performance ""for security reasons"". They also expressed their condolences to Mr Aunion Monroy's family, saying they ""regret the terrible accident"". The 42-year-old acrobat was thought to have been wearing a harness as the box was suspended from a crane. In a final Facebook post on Thursday, he posted a picture of him with his boyfriend, writing: ""I can't wait to see my beautiful boyfriend. Love, come to my arms!!!!!"" His sister confirmed his death in a post online. Estefi Chaje wrote: ""To all the friends of my brother Pedro Aunion Monroy. I'm sorry to tell you that he died today.

The 'game' began in Russia several years ago and around 130 youngsters are believed to have taken their own lives in the country since then. It is spread on social media and there are concerns that British children as young as seven may now also be at risk. :: Blue Whale death game leaves trail of misery Online child protection specialist Jonathan Taylor told Sky News: ""Last week I was in a primary school and a Year 3 pupil, a boy, asked me about it. ""I would not be speaking to primary school children about Blue Whale but they know about it. When I asked who else had heard about this you had 20 hands go up. ""The children are talking about Blue Whale. They may not know exactly what they are talking about but the curiosity of a child ... they may then go on to the internet to see what they can do."" Most of the fatalities of Blue Whale have been in Russia but there are also reports of incidents in Ukraine, Estonia, Kenya, Brazil and Argentina. A case has also been reported in Ireland and, earlier this year, Devon and Cornwall police tweeted a warning for young people to be aware of the risks. Psychotherapist Noel Bell said: ""Whilst we rationally might think how could anyone fall for such ridiculous requests and end up in such a dire situation, the fact is they pick vulnerable people. ""It is through that vulnerability that people become susceptible to committing self-harm."" The NSPCC's head of young campaigners, Emily Cherry, said: ""It's really important to emphasise the role of parents in having regular early conversations around the online world with their children."" She also said social media providers and the online industry should be ""stepping up their game to make sure we're keeping children safe online"". Russian first-year university student Oleg Kapaev told Sky News he started playing Blue Whale when he was bored. Before long he was given the 'task' of jumping off a 20-storey building. He said: ""I didn't feel like I needed to kill myself. I felt I needed to complete the task. ""I only had this thought in my head - that I need to complete the task.""

Prime Minister Theresa May is facing calls to announce a Hillsborough-style inquiry into the allegations, including claims that patients were not told of the risks, even after the dangers became clear. A joint letter signed by six opposition leaders calls the scandal, which has claimed the lives of at least 2,400 people in Britain, ""one of the worst peacetime disasters in our country's history"". The number includes many haemophiliacs who died from hepatitis C and AIDS-related illnesses after receiving contaminated blood products from the NHS in the 1970s and 1980s. Mrs May has promised that health ministers ""will look at any new evidence that is brought forward"", and the Department of Health said the amount of money spent on payments to victims was increased to record levels in 2016. Mr Burnham said a national public inquiry would be able to get to the truth quicker than a police investigation and could examine documents at both a local and national level. He said: ""I've got extensive evidence that's been sent to me by many victims of serious crimes in my view - falsification of medical records, people being tested for hepatitis C, HIV without their knowledge or consent. Pleased to co-ordinate 6 Westminster party leaders writing to the PM calling for a U.K. public inquiry into the #ContaminatedBlood scandal. pic.twitter.com/A90drDOyJH ""Also positive diagnoses of HIV and hep C being withheld from people and those people not knowing that they had it subsequently then infecting partners or other family members. Serious, serious allegations."" The six leaders, including Labour's Jeremy Corbyn and the Democratic Unionist Party's Nigel Dodds, said in their letter: ""Whenever public disasters of this kind take place, Government has a fundamental duty to support those affected in getting the answers they need; to disclose everything they know; and to ensure that officials are called to account for their actions. ""We regret that for many decades, the victims of the contaminated blood scandal have been denied this right."" Supplies of the clotting agent Factor VIII were imported from the US, some of which turned out to be infected. Much of the plasma used to make the product came from donors like prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood. The joint letter calls for the inquiry to ""investigate the role of profit-making American firms in supplying blood factor concentrates to people with haemophilia"". Liz Carroll, chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, welcomed the publication of the letter and said she hopes the PM ""acts swiftly to right this historic wrong"". She said: ""Almost 2,500 of our members have died and will never see justice while 2,500 more still suffer with substantial health issues. ""Despite support from the Government, many continue to live in poverty - with an uncertain future - unable to work as careers were cut short due to ill health or to care for loved ones. ""The Government have said that no liability has been shown, however there has never been an inquiry with a remit to investigate and challenge this claim."""
2017-07-09,Johanna Konta has found herself the bookies' pick for Wimbledon as the tournament enters its second week. But who is the star of British women's tennis? ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170709151646/http://news.sky.com/story/johanna-konta-who-is-the-british-star-now-favourite-to-win-wimbledon-10942629,"Virginia Wade was the last British woman to win Wimbledon - back in 1977 - but now Konta could end that 40-year drought and is 4/1 on to win at the All England Club. The 26-year-old's status at favourite is a far cry from her first outing at the world-famous tournament five years ago. Then ranked 212 in the world, she appeared on Court 17 as a wildcard and lost to American Christina McHale in the first round. Now ranked number seven, Konta has become one the game's elite. Her best result so far is reaching the semis of the Australian Open last year. Konta was born to Hungarian migrant parents in Sydney, Australia. Her father Gabor, a hotelier, and her mother Gabriella, a dentist, emigrated to the country separately and most of her extended family still live in Hungary. She can also speak the language. Her parents introduced her to tennis at the age of eight and she started to play at an after-school club. Her skill on the court was spotted at the age of 11 by Pete McCraw, the women's coach for Tennis Australia, who selected her for the squad. However, her tennis career almost ended before it began after she lost her financial support when the team had its funding cut. Determined to nurture their daughter's talent, the family left Australia and arrived in Britain when she was aged 14, eventually settling in Eastbourne, East Sussex, which is home of the annual women's pre-Wimbledon tournament. Having trained at prestigious tennis academies in Barcelona and Texas, she also spent time at a number of coaching schools in the UK, including the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton. Konta was granted British citizenship in 2012 and went on to post a photo of her UK passport online. She counts her best tennis memory so far as representing Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics. Coached by Belgian Wim Fissette, she counts the serve as her favourite weapon on the court. Konta can also draw on sporting pedigree in her family, with one of her grandfathers having played football for Hungary during the 1950s. He was later coach of the Ghana international team. Her older sister, who still lives in Australia, is married to Australian rules footballer Shane Mumford. A big music fan, she says on her Twitter bio that she ""would love to go to concerts most nights"". She once joked that she would remortgage her house to see U2 and plans to see the band once Wimbledon is over. While guarded about her private life, she admits to enjoying the ""watching movies, reading and the occasional shopping spree"" while also taking gelato ""very seriously""."
2017-07-09,"On Monday, the Northern Ireland Secretary told the Commons he believed a deal to restore power-sharing at Stormont was achievable ""possibly as early as this week.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170709151646/http://news.sky.com/story/why-did-brokenshire-talk-up-the-prospect-of-stormont-power-sharing-deal-10937092,"Twenty-four hours later, James Brokenshire conceded what most commentators had long concluded - that both sides would not be able to reach agreement ""in the immediate term"". No one had been more surprised than the DUP and Sinn Fein - the two parties at the negotiating table - when he told the House they were making progress in the talks. But why would the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland talk up the prospects for a breakthrough when the two main parties were briefing journalists to the contrary? Were the DUP and Sinn Fein indicating compromise privately but denying it publicly? Sources close to the negotiating team of each party are adamant that was not the case. The Democratic Unionists believe James Brokenshire was simply buying more time for the parties before calling another election or moving to restore direct rule from Westminster. But Sinn Fein suspects the Northern Ireland Secretary could not admit the scale of the problem in Northern Ireland while the Democratic Unionists are propping up the Tories. That's what the party's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill, means when she says the devolution vacuum constitutes ""a monumental failure by Theresa May"". By constantly pushing back ""deadlines"", the British Government has created the impression it does not know what to do about Northern Ireland, six months after the devolved government collapsed. For the 19 years since the Good Friday Agreement, relative political stability in the form of a power-sharing government at Stormont has helped maintain a relative peace here. DUP leader Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill don't have the option of heading to the beach and burying their heads in the sand this summer. If they can't find a way to rebuild the trust that enabled their parties to share power in the past, there will be a dark cloud over Northern Ireland's hope for a politically stable future."

It would also become the UK's first national park to be granted world heritage site status. But, beautiful though the area is, that alone will not secure success. For the site to qualify on beauty alone, UNESCO's criteria says it would have to contain ""superlative natural phenomena"". So the bid also promotes the area as one of culture, in particular the Picturesque Movement and the works of poets such as Coleridge, Keats, and Wordsworth. Those who have supported the bid, like Nigel Wilkinson of Windermere Lake Cruises, said the status could boost the economy. ""We already get millions of visitors coming here from around the world,"" he told me. ""But with the benefit of world heritage status, day trippers could become overnight guests, and short stay visitors from overseas may choose to lengthen their vacations."" Other businesses were more cautious, wary of another tier of bureaucracy in an area already under the restrictions of the National Parks Authority. Jonathan Wilkinson, owns Kimi's Artisan Gelato in Bowness. He said: ""I'm not wholly against the bid, but there is a worry that we could become a huge museum or, worse, a mausoleum. ""We need to know that in the future we'll be able to adapt and diversify if we need to."" Some environmentalists also criticised the bid, fearing it may prevent farming practices, which they consider harmful, from being changed. But Will Benson, who farms sheep and cattle in the hills, said: ""From a world heritage point of view, farming has moulded what the Lake District is today. ""You've got a mosaic of different herbs and flowers, and if the land wasn't grazed by sheep it would be just scrub or woodland."" UNESCO will announce their decision later today."

Police and the fire service have begun an investigation to establish the cause of the blaze. It is currently not being treated as suspicious. An eyewitness reported seeing two people being given CPR as emergency services tackled the fire.

Earlier, soon after the meeting with Mrs May, Mr Trump said he expects to reach a ""very powerful"" trade deal with Britain after it leaves the EU. He also hailed the ""very special relationship"" he had forged with the British Prime Minister. Mrs May began by giving a statement outlining what agreements had been made to combat the movement of jihadists and extremism. She added: ""Like other world leaders here, I'm dismayed at the US decision to pull out of the Paris agreement and I've urged President Trump to rejoin the Paris agreement. ""The UK's commitment to the Paris agreement and tackling climate change is as strong as ever."" Donald Trump was given room to push ahead with his America First policy by the agreement struck by the G20 group of nations. The US President won a series of concessions from the 20 richest developed and emerging economies, including over climate change. In a final statement agreed by all 20 countries, 19 of the group's members acknowledged Mr Trump's decision to take the US out of the Paris accord. They also accommodated Washington's wish to help other countries to ""access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently"". And while renewing an key anti-protectionist pledge, the G20's communique for the first time underscored the rights of countries to protect their markets with ""legitimate trade defence instruments"". During his election campaign, Mr Trump promised to ""buy American"" and ""hire American"" - a stance that has set many of his allies against him. Germany chancellor Angela Merkel called the US position on the Paris accord ""regrettable"" but said she was pleased the other nations that remained signed up to it agreed it was ""irreversible"". She added she disagreed with Mrs May who on Friday had said that she thought the US could still decide to return to the Paris accord at some point in the future. French President Emmanuel Macron said he would be hosting a summit in Paris in December with a view to taking new actions on climate. He said he hoped he could still convince Mr Trump to change his mind. Vladimir Putin, who had a one-to-one meeting with Mr Trump, said the compromise on climate change was ""optimal"". He vowed Russia would meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement. The US President said he had had a ""tremendous meeting"" with his Russian counterpart, in his first comments on his talks with Vladimir Putin on Friday, which lasted more than two hours. On trade, Mrs May said the UK was a ""leading advocate for free trade and open markets"" but said she acknowledged that some people felt ""left behind by globalisation and not all countries are playing by the rules"". On Brexit, she added: ""I've held a number of meetings with other world leaders at this summit and have been struck by their willingness and strong desire to form ambitious bilateral trading relationships with the UK after Brexit."" She said the US, Japan, China and India have all shown interest in a trade deal. ""This is a powerful vote of confidence in British goods and British services, Britain's economy and the British people and we look forward to building on these conversations in the months ahead,"" she said. Violent protests by anti-globalisation and climate change campaigners have been taking place outside the summit in Hamburg. Fresh clashes erupted early on Sunday, with protesters setting fire to a number of vehicles. Since Thursday, when 12,000 campaigners marched on the streets, around 213 police officers have been injured and 143 people arrested. There has not been an official estimate for the number of injuries among protesters."

Mrs May did not discuss the environment during her 50-minute G20 meeting with Mr Trump, according to 10 Downing Street, but said she was ""dismayed"" by America's withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement when speaking at a news conference afterwards. Mr Corbyn said: ""I would be very strongly challenging Donald Trump on his wish to walk away from the Paris climate change accords. ""I hope he will understand that unless all the nations of the world get together to reduce emissions and try to preserve and protect our planet then the next generation are going to have more climate disasters."" Mr Corbyn said that challenging the ""economic orthodoxy"" of austerity would also have been on the table if he had attended the gathering of world leaders. Speaking at the G20 summit, Mr Trump told reporters he expects to reach a ""very powerful"" trade deal with the UK and praised the ""special"" relationship between the two countries. My Corbyn's comments were made at the Durham Miners' Gala, which he described as ""Europe's biggest demonstration of working class culture""."

Ministers have often claimed that German carmakers, along with other key European industries such as French farmers and winemakers, would put pressure on their governments to agree a comprehensive deal which keeps tariff-free trade between the UK and the remaining 27 member states. But the leaders of two of Germany's main business organisations said the priority for them was maintaining the integrity of the single market. Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, the federation of German industries, told The Observer: ""Defending the single market, a key European project, must be the priority for the European Union. ""Europe must maintain the integrity of the single market and its four freedoms: goods, capital, services, and labour. ""It is the responsibility of the British Government to limit the damage on both sides of the Channel. ""Over the coming months, it will be extraordinarily difficult to avert negative effects on British businesses in particular."" Ingo Kramer, president of the confederation of German employers' associations (BDA), told the newspaper: ""The single market is one of the major assets of the EU. Access to the single market requires the acceptance of all four single market freedoms. ""The UK will remain a very important partner for us, but we need a fair deal for both sides respecting this principle. ""The cohesion of the remaining 27 EU member states has highest priority."" The intervention comes in the wake of the G20 summit, at which Mrs May received a boost from US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump highlighted the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, saying he expects to reach a ""very powerful"" agreement ""very quickly"". The PM said it was a ""powerful vote of confidence"" in Britain that Mr Trump and other leaders have shown a ""strong desire"" to strike new trade deals after Brexit. Justice Secretary David Lidington acknowledged a US trade deal ""wouldn't be enough on its own"", but told the BBC's Andrew Marr show ""it would be a very good thing to have, as would trade deals with the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America"". Meanwhile, three former Conservative ministers have hit out at Mrs May's approach to Brexit. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve and ex-education secretary Nicky Morgan criticised the red line the PM has put on allowing any role for the European Court of Justice after Britain cuts ties with Brussels. Mr Grieve told The Sunday Telegraph that the Government should have an open mind, saying: ""We have to be realistic. Some of the attitudes to the ECJ seem to be a bit knee jerk. It has a pariah status. ""I've never been particularly impressed with it, but the fact is it is there and it's going to be doing a lot of work that is relevant to us."" Ms Morgan said: ""There may be some merit in just thinking about the detail of our future relationship with the ECJ before we draw a line through the relationship entirely."" Former culture minister Ed Vaizey and senior Labour MP Rachel Reeves used a joint article in The Sunday Telegraph to criticise the decision to pull out of Euratom, the European civil nuclear regulator."

It will also fuel claims of nepotism against the US leader, who has promoted family members to top White House roles. The image of the First Daughter at the top table sparked a barrage of criticism on social media, with many raising concerns over her unelected status. :: Trump expects 'very powerful' US-UK trade deal Because an unelected, unqualified, unprepared New York socialite is the best person to represent American national interests https://t.co/hmRCfwebCc In a post on Twitter, historian and columnist Anne Applebaum decried what she described as ""an unelected, unqualified, unprepared New York socialite"" being seen as ""the best person to represent American national interests"". Ivanka Trump officially joined her father's administration as an unpaid employee with the title Assistant to the President earlier this year, following an outcry over her plans to serve in a more informal capacity. Her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser to President Donald Trump. Responding to the controversy, a White House official said: ""Ivanka was sitting in the back and then briefly joined the main table when the President had to step out."" They also stressed that ""when other leaders stepped out, their seats were also briefly filled by others"". Sky News' diplomatic editor Dominic Waghorn said the publication of the picture was likely to be the result of mischief-making by Moscow. He said: ""The Russian official probably would not have tweeted it without approval of her bosses and the message it sends out there is: 'You criticise Russia for not being a democracy; well, what kind of democracy is America?' ""So I guess playing mischief with the perceptions of America. ""I think it's more what you'd expect from a dictator really, using a family member to represent himself at an international summit, than you'd expect from a democratically elected American president."" Speaking earlier at the summit, which has seen violent riots outside, Mr Trump praised his daughter at the launch of a new women's entrepreneurship fund she helped organise. :: G20 summit in Hamburg exposes splits in post-war world order He said: ""I'm very proud of my daughter, Ivanka; always have been, from day one - I had to tell you that, from day one.

In an audio clip recorded by the Huffington Post website, she is heard using the phrase ""the real n***** in the woodpile"". Ms Morris, who was first elected to Parliament at the 2010 general election, described her comment as ""entirely unintentional"", adding: ""I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused."" She was speaking at an event on Monday to discuss Britain's future financial services relationship with the EU, hosted by the Politeia think tank at central London's exclusive East India Club. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I was shocked to hear of these remarks, which are completely unacceptable. ""I immediately asked the chief whip to suspend the party whip. Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today's society."" The suspension of Ms Morris could add further pressure on Mrs May's minority Government during forthcoming votes in the House of Commons, following the Prime Minister's disastrous General Election result. The Tories have been left relying on the DUP for support in order to pull together a fragile majority of MPs. Ms Morris's remark is reported to have been made in reference to Britain potentially leaving the EU without a Brexit deal, with Ms Morris recorded saying: ""And then we get to the real n***** in the woodpile which is in two years what happens if there is no deal?"" Fellow Brexit-supporting MPs Sir Bill Cash and Sir John Redwood were also scheduled to speak at the event. A spokesperson for Politeia said: ""The MP has apologised unreservedly and we are happy she has apologised."" Rival politicians demanded the Tories cut ties with Ms Morris over her remark, who was also told to consider resigning as an MP. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas told Sky News the ""right thing"" for the Conservative backbencher to do would be for her to quit Parliament. Ms Lucas said: ""I'm very glad that Theresa May has taken this action, it has taken her a number of hours to do so and I think it might have been more reassuring had she spoken out more quickly. ""And I think she also needs to address the fact there were other Conservative MPs there in the room at the time who apparently didn't bat an eyelid about this either. ""The bottom line is this kind of language, these kind of attitudes, have absolutely no place in modern Britain."" She added: ""A lot of people will have taken very, very serious offence at the words that she spoke."" Outgoing Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""The Conservative Party should withdraw the whip from Anne Marie Morris and they should do it today. ""Every hour they leave her in place, is a stain on them and the so called 'compassionate conservatism' they supposedly espouse. ""I am utterly shocked that this person represents the good people of Newton Abbot."" Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour's co-national campaign co-ordinator, branded Ms Morris's comments ""outrageous and totally unacceptable"". He said: ""Theresa May once spoke about changing the Tories' 'Nasty Party' tag. If she's serious about that, she will admit it's not enough for the Tories to 'investigate' and will apologise and act immediately. ""If that means withdrawing the whip, that's what they should do."" Speechless, not just at the remark being made but also at the reported lack of a reaction from the Tories there. Utterly appalling. https://t.co/aYcZtA8n9u In 2008, then-Conservative leader David Cameron stood by Lord Dixon-Smith after the Tory peer apologised for using the same phrase as Ms Morris during a debate in the House of Lords. The dated figure of speech was common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was frequently used in literature and film. In 2007, former Tory MP Patrick Mercer was forced to resign from his party's front bench after making comments about race in the Army, which Mr Cameron described as ""completely unacceptable""."
2017-07-10,A teenager has had a lucky escape from a bear attack after waking to find the animal biting his head.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170710153001/http://news.sky.com/story/teenager-woken-by-bear-crunching-on-his-head-10943150,"The 19-year-old had been working at a camp in Colorado and had been sleeping outside Glacier View Ranch, about 48 miles northwest of Denver. He woke up at 4am on Sunday to a ""crunching sound"" and found the bear's jaws digging into his head as the animal trying to drag him out of his sleeping bag. The boy fought back, punching and hitting the animal as his colleagues woke up, realised what was happening and also tried to deter the bear. Eventually, the animal gave up and walked away. The boy, identified only as Dylan, was treated in hospital. Dylan teaches wilderness survival at the camp and, while his 12 and 13-year-old students had been asleep nearby, none of them were hurt. He told KMGH-TV that he thought the bear had dragged him between 10 and 12 feet before he was able to escape. ""The crunching noise, I guess, was the teeth scraping against the skull as it dug in."" He also told KCNC: ""I just started hitting the bear as hard as I could. ""And I found its eye, and I started poking its eye with my fingers. ""I feel really lucky - if I would have been turned any other direction, it could have gotten the side of my face or my neck."" Traps have been set for the bear and wildlife officers will also use dogs to search for it. Any bear caught is likely to be euthanised before being tested to see if it is the culprit, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill. Black bears are not usually aggressive but they will fight to defend their cubs and they are also attracted to tents with food inside. Last month, a 16-year-old boy was killed after he got lost during a mountain race south of Anchorage and a woman was mauled to death about 275 miles northeast of the city."

""The fire was moving very fast. People were watching, but we were scared the building could explode at any time since there are restaurants with kitchens nearby."" Other emergency services were also called to the fire, with London Ambulance Service saying that it had not terated any patients. At about 3.20am, firefighters had the fire under control but will remain at the scene during the morning for ""damping down"". The cause of the blaze is not known. A different part of the market was damaged by a major fire in 2008, shutting the attraction for several months."

""It's absolutely horrendous at the moment,"" he said. ""Our members are getting assaulted at a rate of 19 per day."" ""I'd like to see our members routinely issued with stab-proof vests, Tasers, PAVA (irritant) spray and rigid cuffs. ""We've only got an extendable baton, that's not enough. The violence is on the rise, the assaults against our members are on the rise and we need the resources to be able to quell the violence and do our job."" A riot at HMP Birmingham in December was described as the worst prison riot since Strangeways in 1990. Hundreds of prisoners went on the rampage for 12 hours. It was eventually ended by specially trained riot officers, known as Tornadoes. A Sky News Freedom of Information request has found the number of times Tornado officers have been called to deal with incidents in jails in England and Wales has risen dramatically since 2011. In 2011 they were called to three incidents, in 2012 just two, and in 2013 they were called five times. But in 2014 the number of incidents rose to 16, with 15 calls in 2015 and 16 calls in 2016. Mr Fairhurst is a Tornado-trained officer and has been called to half a dozen riots. ""When you attend riots it's just like a war zone,"" he said. ""You get there, you don't know what's going on, you just formulate a plan and you roll with it. You face extreme violence. ""You put your life on the line. It's very frightening, you don't know what's going to happen."" Former inmate Ben Gibson, 31, has been in and out of prison over the last seven years.

""I can imagine someone in normal society saying what I've seen is shocking - but that's what happens in prison. It is often."" He blames staffing levels and said when there were not enough officers on the wings prisoners were forced to remain locked up rather than go to education lessons or the gym. ""If your door is locked and you have very little in your cell to help with rehabilitation except a TV then what do you expect to happen?"" he said. ""This is a result of people feeling unhappy, a result of a lack of opportunity and a result of not having any hope or an education."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are committed to making prisons places of safety and reform. It is vital we do everything we can to tackle those issues that undermine security in our prisons and ensure they are safe environments for both staff and prisoners. ""We have implemented a range of measures to increase safety across the estate, including the provision of body-worn cameras, the installation of CCTV, and extra training for officers to manage incidents. ""We do not tolerate violence against our hardworking staff. Where incidents occur we will always work closely with the police to push for the strongest possible punishment."""

2017-07-10,Johanna Konta has found herself the bookies' pick for Wimbledon as the tournament enters its second week. But who is the star of British women's tennis? ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170710153001/http://news.sky.com/story/johanna-konta-who-is-the-british-star-now-favourite-to-win-wimbledon-10942629,"Virginia Wade was the last British woman to win Wimbledon - back in 1977 - but now Konta could end that 40-year drought and is 4/1 on to win at the All England Club. The 26-year-old's status at favourite is a far cry from her first outing at the world-famous tournament five years ago. Then ranked 212 in the world, she appeared on Court 17 as a wildcard and lost to American Christina McHale in the first round. Now ranked number seven, Konta has become one the game's elite. Her best result so far is reaching the semis of the Australian Open last year. Konta was born to Hungarian migrant parents in Sydney, Australia. Her father Gabor, a hotelier, and her mother Gabriella, a dentist, emigrated to the country separately and most of her extended family still live in Hungary. She can also speak the language. Her parents introduced her to tennis at the age of eight and she started to play at an after-school club. Her skill on the court was spotted at the age of 11 by Pete McCraw, the women's coach for Tennis Australia, who selected her for the squad. However, her tennis career almost ended before it began after she lost her financial support when the team had its funding cut. Determined to nurture their daughter's talent, the family left Australia and arrived in Britain when she was aged 14, eventually settling in Eastbourne, East Sussex, which is home of the annual women's pre-Wimbledon tournament. Having trained at prestigious tennis academies in Barcelona and Texas, she also spent time at a number of coaching schools in the UK, including the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton. Konta was granted British citizenship in 2012 and went on to post a photo of her UK passport online. She counts her best tennis memory so far as representing Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics. Coached by Belgian Wim Fissette, she counts the serve as her favourite weapon on the court. Konta can also draw on sporting pedigree in her family, with one of her grandfathers having played football for Hungary during the 1950s. He was later coach of the Ghana international team. Her older sister, who still lives in Australia, is married to Australian rules footballer Shane Mumford. A big music fan, she says on her Twitter bio that she ""would love to go to concerts most nights"". She once joked that she would remortgage her house to see U2 and plans to see the band once Wimbledon is over. While guarded about her private life, she admits to enjoying the ""watching movies, reading and the occasional shopping spree"" while also taking gelato ""very seriously""."

The group, which accuses the Government of ""repeated and serious breaches"" of international humanitarian law, says more than 10,000 civilians have been killed since 2015 as the Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervenes in the Yemeni civil war. However, judges dismissed the claim, saying the decision to continue trading with Saudi Arabia was ""not irrational or unlawful"". They said the evidence, some of which was given in secret in order to protect national security, ""demonstrates that the Secretary of State was rationally entitled to conclude that the Saudi Arabia coalition were not deliberately targeting civilians"". Lawyer Rosa Curling, representing CAAT, told Sky News: ""In our view the Government is in breach of laws they themselves put in place, which make clear that there are certain circumstances in which arms cannot be sold."" ""The evidence that we saw in the opening court sessions showed that there was a clear risk of international humanitarian war breaches by the Saudi coalition in Yemen. In those circumstances, the Government's own rules say they shouldn't be selling arms."" Since the Saudi-led coalition has been involved in the Yemeni civil war, abound £3.3bn of sales from the UK's arms industry has gone to Saudi Arabia. Save the Children said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by the High Court's decision. ""Britain is selling bombs to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen,"" it said. ""The Saudi-led coalition is killing children in repeated violations of international humanitarian law."" Oxfam said the result ""sets back arms control 25 years"", adding: ""There is a clear moral case for the Government to suspend its sales."" CAAT said it was ""extremely disappointed"" with the outcome and would be appealing."

Research from the campaign, co-founded by online platform Just Eat, showed takeaway restaurants contributed £4.5bn to economic output last year and employed more than 230,000 workers. The report has called for the Government to ensure that the immigration system enables firms to access suitably qualified staff from the EU and address skills shortages. Ibrahim Dogus, a restaurateur who chairs the campaign, said: ""Takeaways up and down the country contribute billions to growth and are behind thousands of jobs. ""But many are being hamstrung by skills shortages, rising food and wage costs, as well as business rates. ""While the Government's move to clarify the status of EU nationals is a welcome step, more needs to be done to ensure takeaways can access the skills they need. ""That's why we are calling for an immigration system that addresses areas of genuine skill shortage, rather than one that focuses on skill level alone."" The takeaway sector is just one part of the economy where bosses are worried about their ability to recruit workers from overseas in the wake of the Brexit. Hotels, restaurants and cafes are heavily reliant on European employees and are expected to face a recruitment gap if they cannot bring in the staff they need."
2017-07-10,What does work mean to you?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170710153001/http://news.sky.com/story/plans-to-shape-the-future-of-the-uks-gig-economy-10943742,"Probably money, which you use to pay for the most important things in life, but what else? Why do you work? Maybe you find that everyday work improves your brain, advances your career and gives you the chance to enjoy the company of colleagues. But perhaps you find work stressful, debilitating and shapeless. Possibly you think it's all these things, rolled into one. Nine months ago, the Prime Minister appointed Matthew Taylor to lead an independent review into working practices. Why him? Well, Mr Taylor is the chief executive of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, better known to everyone as the RSA. The RSA exists to come up with creative solutions to social challenges - and few challenges appear more pressing than the way in which our working lives are changing. On Tuesday, Mr Taylor will present his findings, and at the heart of them will be his analysis of the so-called gig economy - the mesh of flexible hours, short-term contracts and freelance workers. If that sounds complicated, think of Uber drivers or cyclists in Deliveroo jackets, checking their phones to see what work is available and how much money they stand to earn. They work flexibly, but they normally work for the same couple of companies. And that raises a question. To most people's minds, these people aren't employees in the traditional sense, but nor are they self-employed. So Mr Taylor will suggest a new form of employment - what he will describe as a ""dependent contractor"" - and will also say that such people deserve more employment rights, such as sick pay, holiday leave and a closer tie to the minimum wage. In short, he wants more clarity and more regulation, and that may well be the bit of this report that gets the greatest coverage. But there's likely to be plenty more that deserves both attention and, long-term, a policy response. Look in the right places, and you can find plenty of clues as to the direction of Mr Taylor's thinking. In May he delivered a speech entitled ""Good Work for All"" - his report for the Prime Minister is called ""Good Work"". In that speech, Mr Taylor outlines five different areas in which he thinks working practices could be changed. Each of these, I would guess, will be in his report. First is the need to develop better progress away from poverty, which he describes as ""a moral responsibility"". Mr Taylor says 13.5 million people in Britain live in poverty, 55% of of them in a working household. ""Jobs,"" he wrote in his speech ""are not a guarantee against poverty"". His second point is that ""some work can make you sick"", with stress levels rising fastest among low-paid workers. Third is the UK's famously bad level of productivity - Mr Taylor says the country needs better management and more investment in training. His fourth area is technology and the effect of the gig economy, which he says can ""atomise workers"", while his fifth point is that there needs to be a stronger relationship between work and society - ""why is the offer to consumers so much more ambitious than the one to workers and producers?"" he asks. These are fundamental questions about the UK economy, about the changing ways in which we work, the reasons we work, and how work affects us. The question is what will follow. Mr Taylor's report will, no doubt, be examined closely, particularly because the gig economy has recently bubbled up the political agenda, but also because our economic future now looks so volatile. He has already said that he worries he won't get a reaction, that his report will be seen as ""empty posturing"", but that he will push hard for a public debate. But the test will be whether policy changes, whether his recommendations are accepted and built upon. Having commissioned this report in the first place, the Prime Minister will be under considerable pressure to respond to it."

Employers' worries about a lack of sufficiently qualified recruits to fill high-skilled roles were also highlighted in the poll. The education and skills survey questioned 344 companies and looked at issues relating to school leavers and college and technical education and apprenticeships as well as graduate recruitment. It found that areas where graduate job seekers were ""widely seen as having weaknesses"" included levels of international cultural awareness - where 39% of firms were dissatisfied - and customer awareness - where 40% were unhappy. The report added: ""Perhaps of even greater concern is that a third of businesses (32%) voice dissatisfaction with graduates' attitudes and behaviours of self-management and resilience. ""Higher education should be well positioned to help students develop in these areas, recognising their importance for future success in life and work."" It said there were excellent career prospects for graduates ""provided they are equipped with the right attitudes, skills and knowledge to take advantage of those opportunities"". The poll also found that 75% of businesses expect to increase the number of high-skilled number of roles they have over coming years, but 61% fear a lack of sufficiently-skilled people to fill them. It also showed continuing concern about the lack of skilled candidates and that careers advice given to young people was ""overwhelmingly poor"". CBI deputy director-general Josh Hardie said: ""Quality of teaching, learning and careers inspiration defines the life chances of young people - it's a shared challenge for us all."" The Department for Education said it had set out the need for ""a skills revolution for success in Brexit Britain"" but acknowledged more needed to be done to improve technical education."

She will say: ""Though the result of last month's General Election was not what I wanted, those defining beliefs remain; my commitment to change in Britain is undimmed; my belief in the potential of the British people and what we can achieve together as a nation remains steadfast; and the determination I have to get to grips with the challenges posed by a changing world never more sure. ""I am convinced that the path that I set out in that first speech outside Number 10 and upon which we have set ourselves as a Government remains the right one."" Her speech will come at the launch of a review she commissioned into modern employment practices, such as the rise of ""gig economy"" jobs with firms such as Uber and Deliveroo. The review is expected to set out a series of extra rights for those in insecure jobs, but Mrs May will acknowledge that she may have to accept suggestions from other parties. ""When I commissioned this report I led a majority government in the House of Commons. The reality I now face as Prime Minister is rather different,"" she said. ""In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in Parliament as well as in the country. ""So I say to the other parties in the House of Commons... come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle these challenges as a country."" Labour has mocked the Prime Minister's request. Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said: ""Theresa May has finally come clean and accepted the Government has completely run out of ideas. ""As a result they're having to beg for policy proposals from Labour. They're also brazenly borrowing Labour's campaign slogans. ""But no one will be fooled - the Tories are the party of the privileged few."" The Liberal Democrats said Mrs May's stance looked like a plea for help on Brexit from Labour, but Jeremy Corbyn was already supporting her plans. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""A call for Labour to contribute is superfluous. ""On the single biggest issue of our generation - Brexit - Corbyn isn't contributing, he is cheerleading."""

The room is dominated by stuffed toys and pictures of boats. But in one corner machines bleep and whirr. These machines are keeping him alive. ""We tried to make his room as normal as possible"" said his dad, Art, as he carefully dressed his son in blue shorts and a striped t-shirt. If anyone can understand what Charlie Gard's parents are going through it's Art Estopinan. His son has a similar condition to Charlie, which began when he was a baby. ""When he was about 20-18 months or so we thought we were going to lose him because everything was shutting down. ""We called in a priest to give him the last rites but luckily, little by little, he started to get stronger with these medications."" Art is referring to experimental medication given by the same US doctor who is offering to treat Charlie. He gave them some light in their darkest period. ""My son was dying and no one gave us hope - everyone told us: 'go home - he will die'. ""I looked at this doctor in the eye and I said I will do everything possible to save my son - and I did."" The medication comes in powder form. It is dissolved in water and given to Arturo three times a day. His mum and dad said progress has been slow but gradually their son is getting stronger. He is alert, he can move his legs and arms and clutch things in his hands. :: Timeline - The battle to save Charlie Gard Experts have said that while Arturo and Charlie have similar conditions they can't be compared because they are different mutations. Arturo's dad said this is no reason not to try. ""Charlie is writing the books for his mutation just like my son did for his,"" he said. ""With all due respect to those doctors, because I'm only a father I'm not a doctor, they perhaps are unaware of the extraordinary medications. ""Even though they are experimental, these are clinicians and medical doctors that are specialists in mitochondrial conditions and they are hopeful and they believe that these medications will work for Charlie Gard."" Art has been to the UK to meet Charlie and his parents, Connie and Chris, and has kept in touch with them throughout their battle. ""I speak to Connie often. Even though we are separated by an ocean - we are one family."" Arturo couldn't wait for our interview to be over so he could get outside in his wheelchair into the sunshine. He loves being near the water. He told his mum, Olga, he wants a fishing rod. He also loves dogs and The Lion King. Overall he is able to experience joy and a quality of life his parents didn't dare to dream of a few years ago. But there is no guarantee that Charlie would respond in the same way. These parents - who have faced unimaginable challenges - want their friends across the sea to have at least the same chance they did."
2017-07-10,"Mike Ashley arrived at court wearing a black suit, white shirt and black tie, and then spent the afternoon talking about a rival called Mr Blue.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170710153001/http://news.sky.com/story/court-case-sheds-light-on-the-world-of-mike-ashley-10938378,"It was rather as if Reservoir Dogs had come to the High Court, but with a focus on booze and business instead of guns and violence. Mr Ashley spent the morning listening intently, as he has for most of this case. As luck would have it, I sat almost directly behind him in Court 26, watching him fiddle with his tie, yawn occasionally and share a word with his lawyer, Justin Barnes. But mostly, he listened to the testimony of the bankers with whom he'd shared a pub. Mr Ashley was prepared. He brought in the following: a spiral-bound notebook, two blue biros, two highlighters (one yellow, one orange), two packs of post-it notes and his spectacles. Over the course of nearly three hours, I didn't see him make a single note. :: Mike Ashley tells court: I'm no Obi-Wan Kenobi He also had two bottles of mineral water and a small Nokia mobile phone. I know he has a Nokia because he later revealed that he favours one particular model. When I looked it up, the model was described as being a rather unexceptional, and not very smart, budget design, but Mr Ashley doesn't mind. He has a box of them that once contained 50 handsets, but now has only half as many. ""Periodically I lose, destroy, damage or have my phone stolen,"" he told the court. ""Whatever happens to a mobile phone happens to mine."" He doesn't need a very smart phone because it turns out he only reads a few of the emails that are sent to him. And he doesn't send any in return. For all the intricacies of his legal dispute with Mr Blue - which largely boils down to whether pub chat is legally enforceable - the greatest attraction of Mr Ashley's testimony was watching him in action. A self-made retail genius worth more than £2bn, but who often appears tetchy, confrontational and slightly awkward in public. And so it was in court. It didn't take long before the probing of Jeffrey Chapman QC began to annoy him. Mr Ashley began to speak slowly and deliberately, as if addressing a very small child, before his temper rose. ""Are you trying to be funny?"" he asked the barrister at one point, who simply glanced up in answer. He later answered a single ""no"" to about a dozen questions in a row, but on other occasions he could barely stop talking, saying that he wanted ""to add colour"" to the debate. Take this - on the subject of Sports Direct's share price - could it be easily manipulated? Mr Ashley held his face in his hands, his spectacles propped up on top of his head, and took in a big breath. ""The City is full of clever people,"" he said, ""and it's all about the numbers."" For numbers, read financial results. ""If I've got good numbers I could turn up at a party naked and it wouldn't matter, the share price would go up. ""If I have bad numbers, then it doesn't matter if I sign up for a monastery. The share price would go down."" He swore several times, held his head in his hands another few times, but also earned a few laughs from the court. Having described the flotation of Sports Direct as ""an unmitigated disaster"", Mr Ashley (who made more than £900m from the deal) admitted that he had already been ""fabulously wealthy"", but said money had not stopped his ambition. ""What do you think I do when I get up in the morning? Just go and buy the neighbour's house?"" He paused before adding: ""I already own it."" This whole case has revolved around questions over drinking, and this was no exception. Mr Ashley said it wasn't true that he made all his business decisions while drinking ""otherwise I'd live in a pub"", but did say that he happily held management meetings in a hotel where he would have four beers before eating, and then another two - or half a bottle of wine - with the meal. He repeatedly claimed to the court that Mr Blue was ""a liar"", but was also hard on himself. ""I am as fat as a pig,"" said Mr Ashley at one point. And in his closing words of the day, he seemed almost wistful. He said people wanted him to go to thousands of ""things"" but he always advised his team ""don't roll me out"". ""I know how disappointing it is when they actually meet me,"" said Mr Ashley. ""It is a let down. They think 'Jesus, I thought I was going to meet a bright bloke'."" And with that, the day came to an end. Mr Ashley collected his pad, his pens and his budget phone and headed out. I suspect he may have gone for a pint."

It is not known at this stage whether the pay deal will be above the 1% cap that is currently in place. In response to the news, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: ""We shall wait with anticipation to see what the pay settlement will be."" Pressure has been growing on Prime Minister Theresa May and Chancellor Phillip Hammond to ease the limit on annual rises, which are decided by pay review bodies but have effectively been capped at 1% since 2013. It is claimed the pay review bodies are likely to recommend figures higher than the cap, which the Conservatives committed to keeping in place until 2020 in their election manifesto. Boris Johnson is one of those who has backed a rethink on the policy. A Government source told Sky News the Foreign Secretary ""supports the idea of public sector workers getting a better pay deal and believes the pay review recommendations are right"". ""He also strongly believes the rises can be done in a responsible way and without causing fiscal pressures,"" the source added. While not expressly suggesting that the cap be lifted for all 5.1 million public sector workers, he followed the Environment Secretary Michael Gove in supporting the work of pay review bodies. It is understood Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Education Secretary Justine Greening have also been pushing the Treasury to loosen the fiscal strictures, with wages falling behind inflation."

But for six weeks from Monday the cost has been discounted by a third to around £400. It is the second time this year Oculus' price has been reduced. In March the bundle's price was slashed by £140. Before the discounts, the headset, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view, was described as ""obscenely cheap"" by its founder, Palmer Luckey. But unlike consoles, the Rift cannot be used by itself - it requires a powerful gaming computer, which could set consumers back more than £1,000. Oculus' vice president of content Jason Rubin said the latest sale is aimed at people who ""may have been sitting on the sideline because of price"", according to The Verge. Mr Rubin also attempted to placate fears that the current model of the Rift would be quickly made redundant by the development of a new, potentially lighter and cheaper model. ""Somebody who goes out and buys a Rift (on sale) is not going to find themselves with hardware that's outdated any time soon,"" he said. ""The Rift is going to be driving a lot of enjoyment for people for many years."" The relatively slow speed at which Oculus has managed to ship units will not have delighted its parent company Facebook, which acquired the company for $2bn in 2014. At the time Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said that the medium would ""become a part of daily life for billions of people"". However that has not happened - and it is unclear if that is because of high prices, something inherent in the technology or another reason. Earlier this year, Facebook and two of Oculus' founders were ordered to pay $500m after losing a lawsuit in which games company ZeniMax Media alleged that Oculus' VR system had been stolen from their own work."

The case returns to the High Court on Monday afternoon following ""new evidence"" from researchers at the Vatican's children's hospital about an experimental treatment that may improve the 11-month-old's condition. Charlie cannot breathe without a ventilator due to a form of mitochondrial disease which affects the cells responsible for energy production and respiration. His parents want to take him to the US for nucleoside therapy. :: The American family fighting for Charlie Ms Yates said there are doctors in the US, Spain, Italy and England who are supporting them and said if the medication works Charlie ""could potentially be a normal boy again"". She said: ""There are 18 children currently on this treatment - one of them wasn't able to do anything and now she's riding a bike. She was on a ventilator as well before and she's not on it anymore. ""This could be a miracle for Charlie,"" she added. Previous attempts by Charlie's parents failed as the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court ruled in favour of Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) doctors, while the European Court of Human Rights said it would not intervene in the case. :: Timeline: Parents' battle to save Charlie Gard Specialists at GOSH, where baby Charlie remains on life support, previously argued nucleoside therapy would not improve his quality of life. But on Friday the hospital applied to the High Court for the fresh hearing ""in light of claims of new evidence relating to potential treatment for his condition"". Ms Yates told Sky News: ""We're the ones who sit with him 24 hours a day - we couldn't do it if he was suffering or in pain... we just want to be able to give him a chance and leave no stone unturned. ""We're not saying Great Ormond Street is a bad hospital but they don't have a specialist for his particular condition.

The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg rejected his final appeal on Monday. Harkins argued that being returned to the US would breach articles relating to inhuman or degrading treatment and the right to a fair trial under the European Convention of Human Rights. If convicted in Florida he would face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, his lawyers argued. Both complaints were declared inadmissible and the court said its decision was final. Harkins, who is originally from Greenock, Inverclyde, was indicted for murder after Joshua Hayes was killed by a gunshot wound to the head. The incident happened during a robbery in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1999. Harkins insisted he had no involvement and has been contesting his extradition since March 2003. He was released on bail and returned to Scotland in 2002 but was jailed in 2003 after being convicted of killing a woman in a road crash in Greenock. Harkins lost a number of attempts to stop his extradition but took his case to the European Court of Human Rights where his initial appeal was rejected in 2012. Despite a petition for a final hearing, the court ruled the complaints should be declared inadmissible as they were ""substantially the same"" as those considered in 2012."

Meanwhile, people are being urged to spend, bank or donate their 'round pounds' to charity before they lose their legal tender status on 15 October.

He said ""all options"" should be on the table in exit talks, including staying in the single market. The Streatham MP said the result of the General Election means MPs and peers have an ""active role"" to play. He said: ""Parliament in this is not a passive bystander. ""We have an active role to play and will have the ability to vote on whatever deal the Government comes forward with at the end of the process."" Mr Umunna said the aim of the group was to avoid an ""extreme job-destroying"" Brexit that could turn Britain into the ""sweatshop of Europe"". The cross-party group could cause problems for Prime Minister Theresa May as she works to steer Brexit legislation through the Commons, relying on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party. As well as working together in Parliament, it will collect evidence from business groups, trade unions and charities about their views on Britain's EU exit. The MPs in the group believe Parliament cannot be ""spectators"" accepting information from ministers, but should be ""active players"" in the process, independently seeking out information to inform voting decisions on the deal the Government manages to negotiate. Mr Umunna, who recently led a Labour revolt over Brexit by calling for the UK to stay in the single market, and prominent Remain campaigner and Conservative MP Anna Soubry, are the group's co-chairmen. The vice-chairmen are Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson, the SNP's international affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins, Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards. Mr Umunna told Sky's Adam Boulton the group was guided by three principles. ""One, everybody thinks we've got to leave with a deal; leaving without a deal would be appalling,"" he said. ""Secondly, we think all options should be kept on the table through the process of the negotiations. ""Thirdly, we want to see the UK have the strongest possible relationship with the EU at the end of the process. That's best for Britain and good for the world."" He added that the group was not about being anti-Jeremy Corbyn or anti-Mrs May. ""This is the biggest issue which is going to come and hit us in a generation, which is going to determine the opportunities of future generations,"" Mr Umunna said. ""If we put party politics in the way of making sure we get the best deal, we will never be forgiven by our constituents. ""We've got to put the national interest and our constituents first here."""

In 2015, there were 271,050 babies born to first-time mothers in England and Wales, compared to 319,011 new cases of cancer. The data also showed that over the last decade more than 1.2 million people have been diagnosed with the disease under the age of 65. This includes 343,000 people in the UK who were diagnosed in their 20s, 30s or 40s between 2006 and 2015. Projections suggest that around half of people will develop cancer at some point in their lives. However, 90% of people living with cancer surveyed by Macmillan said they were still living their lives as normally as they could. Macmillan Cancer Support's chief executive Lynda Thomas said: ""Being told you have cancer changes your life, and it can leave people feeling as if they've been thrust into the unknown, bewildered and unprepared. ""But as more and more people are being diagnosed with cancer, it's important that we are all better informed about what to expect if we do one day receive this shocking news. ""Cancer is almost always life-changing, but it isn't always life-ending. ""Life with cancer is still life - you're still a dad, a sister, a grandparent, a friend."" Research among more than 2,000 people for the charity also showed that cancer is the disease people fear the most (37%), ahead of Alzheimer's disease (27%), stroke (7%), depression (4%), heart disease (4%) or multiple sclerosis (2%). And for one in 10 people in the UK (10%), cancer is their biggest fear of all, ahead of losing a loved one, their own death or terrorism."
2017-07-10,Labour's Andy Burnham has told Sky News he is prepared to go the police if the Government does not act on the contaminated blood scandal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170710153001/http://news.sky.com/story/contaminated-blood-scandal-labours-burnham-threatens-to-go-to-police-10942488,"The former health secretary, who is now mayor of Greater Manchester, says he has received ""serious allegations"" from victims and wants a public inquiry to get to the truth about what he called an ""orchestrated cover-up"". Prime Minister Theresa May is facing calls to announce a Hillsborough-style inquiry into the allegations, including claims that patients were not told of the risks, even after the dangers became clear. A joint letter signed by six opposition leaders calls the scandal, which has claimed the lives of at least 2,400 people in Britain, ""one of the worst peacetime disasters in our country's history"". The number includes many haemophiliacs who died from hepatitis C and AIDS-related illnesses after receiving contaminated blood products from the NHS in the 1970s and 1980s. Mrs May has promised that health ministers ""will look at any new evidence that is brought forward"", and the Department of Health said the amount of money spent on payments to victims was increased to record levels in 2016. Mr Burnham said a national public inquiry would be able to get to the truth quicker than a police investigation and could examine documents at both a local and national level. He said: ""I've got extensive evidence that's been sent to me by many victims of serious crimes in my view - falsification of medical records, people being tested for hepatitis C, HIV without their knowledge or consent. Pleased to co-ordinate 6 Westminster party leaders writing to the PM calling for a U.K. public inquiry into the #ContaminatedBlood scandal. pic.twitter.com/A90drDOyJH ""Also positive diagnoses of HIV and hep C being withheld from people and those people not knowing that they had it subsequently then infecting partners or other family members. Serious, serious allegations."" The six leaders, including Labour's Jeremy Corbyn and the Democratic Unionist Party's Nigel Dodds, said in their letter: ""Whenever public disasters of this kind take place, Government has a fundamental duty to support those affected in getting the answers they need; to disclose everything they know; and to ensure that officials are called to account for their actions. ""We regret that for many decades, the victims of the contaminated blood scandal have been denied this right."" Supplies of the clotting agent Factor VIII were imported from the US, some of which turned out to be infected. Much of the plasma used to make the product came from donors like prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood. The joint letter calls for the inquiry to ""investigate the role of profit-making American firms in supplying blood factor concentrates to people with haemophilia"". Liz Carroll, chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, welcomed the publication of the letter and said she hopes the PM ""acts swiftly to right this historic wrong"". She said: ""Almost 2,500 of our members have died and will never see justice while 2,500 more still suffer with substantial health issues. ""Despite support from the Government, many continue to live in poverty - with an uncertain future - unable to work as careers were cut short due to ill health or to care for loved ones. ""The Government have said that no liability has been shown, however there has never been an inquiry with a remit to investigate and challenge this claim."""

Researchers from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and Imperial College London found that higher levels of coffee consumption were associated with a reduced risk of death from all causes, particularly from circulatory and digestive tract diseases. It is estimated that 55 million cups of coffee are consumed in the UK every day, with many people unsure of the health benefits after decades of mixed messages. Lead author Dr Marc Gunter of the IARC said: ""We found that higher coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause, and specifically for circulatory diseases, and digestive diseases. ""Importantly, these results were similar across all of the 10 European countries, with variable coffee drinking habits and customs. ""Our study also offers important insights into the possible mechanisms for the beneficial health effects of coffee."" Using an earlier European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, the group analysed data from 521,330 people over the age of 35 from 10 European countries, where coffee consumption and preparation methods vary from an espresso in Italy to a cappuccino in the UK. Their diets were assessed using questionnaires and interviews, with the highest level of coffee consumption (by volume) reported in Denmark (900 mL per day) and lowest in Italy (approximately 92 mL per day). Those who drank more coffee were also more likely to be younger, to be smokers, drinkers, eat more meat and less fruit and veg. After 16 years of follow up, almost 42,000 people in the study had died from a range of conditions including cancer, circulatory diseases, heart failure and stroke. Following adjustments for lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking, the researchers found that the group with the highest consumption of coffee had a lower risk for all-causes of death, compared to those who did not drink coffee. Men who downed at least three cups of coffee a day were 18% less likely to die from any cause than non-coffee drinkers. Women drinking the same amount benefited less, but still experienced an 8% reduction in mortality over the period measured. The study is published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. Similar results were reported by American scientists who conducted a separate investigation, recruiting 185,855 participants from different ethnic backgrounds. According to the group, more research is needed to find out which of the compounds in coffee may be giving a protective effect or potentially benefiting health."

Those on the minimum and maximum of the main pay scale - typically teachers in the first few years of their career - will get an increase of up to 2%. Teachers' pay has been frozen since 2010, and this latest announcement means another real-terms pay cut for more than half a million in England and Wales. Prime Minister Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond have come under pressure to lift the cap, including from a number of Cabinet ministers, in the wake of the General Election. Labour has pledged to scrap the measure. The decision is likely to be viewed as an indication the Government intends to stick to its plans to keep a firm hold on the public purse strings despite pressure to change course. Education Secretary Justine Greening said the recommendations, which are due to be introduced in September, ""are consistent with the Government's 1% public sector pay policy"". In a written statement, she said: ""Following previous reforms, schools already have significant flexibility, within the pay ranges, to set pay for individual teachers, taking account of performance and retention."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We recognise and value the hard work of teachers which is why we have accepted the pay deal proposed by the independent STRB, in line with the 1% public sector pay policy. ""This will ensure we continue to strike the balance between being fair to public sector workers and fair to taxpayers."" Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: ""For many teachers, this marks the seventh successive real-terms cut in their pay. ""We will not be able to attract the best and brightest to teaching if we constantly cut their pay."" Meanwhile, NUT executive member Jerry Glazier told Sky News that the 1% pay rise represented ""a disappointing situation for the teaching profession and a missed opportunity for the Government."" He said: ""They had a real opportunity to do something constructive about teachers' pay and in doing so address the recruitment and pension crisis which the profession is having in parts of the country."" The STRB is one of a number of independent bodies that puts forward recommendations on wage increases, which are then either accepted or rejected by Government departments. These recommendations have been affected by a Government cap on public sector pay. After the 2010 election, there was a two-year pay freeze, with school staff getting no increase in their pay in 2011 and 2012. Since then there has been a cap of 1%. The National Union of Teachers says wage increases have fallen behind RPI inflation by 13% between 2010 and 2016."

In an audio clip recorded by the Huffington Post website, she is heard using the phrase ""the real n***** in the woodpile"". Ms Morris, who was first elected to Parliament at the 2010 general election, described her comment as ""entirely unintentional"", adding: ""I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused."" She was speaking at an event on Monday to discuss Britain's future financial services relationship with the EU, hosted by the Politeia think tank at central London's exclusive East India Club. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I was shocked to hear of these remarks, which are completely unacceptable. ""I immediately asked the chief whip to suspend the party whip. Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today's society."" The suspension of Ms Morris could add further pressure on Mrs May's minority Government during forthcoming votes in the House of Commons, following the Prime Minister's disastrous General Election result. The Tories have been left relying on the DUP for support in order to pull together a fragile majority of MPs. Ms Morris's remark is reported to have been made in reference to Britain potentially leaving the EU without a Brexit deal, with Ms Morris recorded saying: ""And then we get to the real n***** in the woodpile which is in two years what happens if there is no deal?"" Fellow Brexit-supporting MPs Sir Bill Cash and Sir John Redwood were also scheduled to speak at the event. A spokesperson for Politeia said: ""The MP has apologised unreservedly and we are happy she has apologised."" Rival politicians demanded the Tories cut ties with Ms Morris over her remark, who was also told to consider resigning as an MP. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas told Sky News the ""right thing"" for the Conservative backbencher to do would be for her to quit Parliament. Ms Lucas said: ""I'm very glad that Theresa May has taken this action, it has taken her a number of hours to do so and I think it might have been more reassuring had she spoken out more quickly. ""And I think she also needs to address the fact there were other Conservative MPs there in the room at the time who apparently didn't bat an eyelid about this either. ""The bottom line is this kind of language, these kind of attitudes, have absolutely no place in modern Britain."" She added: ""A lot of people will have taken very, very serious offence at the words that she spoke."" Outgoing Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""The Conservative Party should withdraw the whip from Anne Marie Morris and they should do it today. ""Every hour they leave her in place, is a stain on them and the so called 'compassionate conservatism' they supposedly espouse. ""I am utterly shocked that this person represents the good people of Newton Abbot."" Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour's co-national campaign co-ordinator, branded Ms Morris's comments ""outrageous and totally unacceptable"". He said: ""Theresa May once spoke about changing the Tories' 'Nasty Party' tag. If she's serious about that, she will admit it's not enough for the Tories to 'investigate' and will apologise and act immediately. ""If that means withdrawing the whip, that's what they should do."" Speechless, not just at the remark being made but also at the reported lack of a reaction from the Tories there. Utterly appalling. https://t.co/aYcZtA8n9u In 2008, then-Conservative leader David Cameron stood by Lord Dixon-Smith after the Tory peer apologised for using the same phrase as Ms Morris during a debate in the House of Lords. The dated figure of speech was common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was frequently used in literature and film. In 2007, former Tory MP Patrick Mercer was forced to resign from his party's front bench after making comments about race in the Army, which Mr Cameron described as ""completely unacceptable""."

The will, which was signed four days before his death, reveals that his UK estate is divided between his third wife Lyndsay and his children. :: Status Quo's Francis Rossi reflects on death of bandmate Rick Parfitt The veteran musician's rock'n'roll career spanned 50 years as he helped propel Status Quo into one of the British rock scene's staple acts.

HMS Queen Elizabeth set off on its maiden voyage late last month but the aircraft carrier, which cost £3bn to build, was mocked by Russia. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon had described Moscow's only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, as ""old and dilapidated"", adding that Russia would be looking at Britain's new vessel with a ""little bit of envy"". But Russian spokesman Igor Konashenkov had dismissed the British aircraft carrier as ""just a convenient oversized target at sea"", saying: ""It is in the interests of the British Royal Navy not to show off the 'beauty' of its aircraft carrier on the high seas any closer than a few hundred miles to its Russian 'distant relative'."" The report also warned that Britain's adversaries were trying to use cyber and anti-satellite tools to disrupt the West. China destroyed a satellite as a test 10 years ago and, since then, there have been reports that Russia is trying to develop the same capability, including an airborne laser system. ""Space assets are vulnerable to electromagnetic and physical attack that could - for example - destroy or degrade navigation and communication systems,"" the report said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""We keep all threats under constant review and we are confident our new aircraft carrier, and other state-of-the-art equipment, is well protected thanks to defensive systems we have invested in as part of our £178bn equipment plan."""
2017-07-11,The future of the British Grand Prix has been thrown into doubt after Silverstone's owners triggered a break clause in their contract with the sport's bosses.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170711161227/http://news.sky.com/story/silverstone-owners-brdc-trigger-break-clause-with-f1-owners-10944795,"The British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC), which owns the Northamptonshire track, says it has lost £7.6m over the last two years and ""run out of road"". The BRDC's move means the last contracted race would be in 2019 unless a new deal is agreed. More than 135,000 F1 fans are due at the circuit on Sunday as Lewis Hamilton bids for a fourth successive British GP win. ""It's not financially viable for us to deliver the British Grand Prix under the terms of our current contract,"" BRDC John Grant told a news conference at the track. ""We have reached the tipping point where we can no longer let our passion for the sport rule our heads."" The BRDC has been the custodian of the British GP for 70 years, but their decision drew a strong response from the sport's owners, the F1 Group. They said: ""We offered to extend the current deadlines in order to focus on everything that's great about Silverstone and F1. ""Regretfully the Silverstone management has chosen to look for a short term advantage to benefit their position. Our focus is still to preserve the British Grand Prix."" Under the current deal, the BRDC pay around £17m to host the race, which increases by 5% each year - and would cost £25m by 2026. An adult general admission ticket for race day costs £185 and £92.50 for a child's under-16 ticket. Seated tickets in the stands can run into the hundreds of pounds. New countries like Russia, Azerbaijan and Bahrain pay up to £40m to host an F1 race, but Silverstone is the only circuit on the race calendar that receives no government funding. 1950 was the last year that saw no British Grand Prix on the F1 calendar."
2017-07-11,Marks & Spencer's boss Steve Rowe said his turnaround plan for the retailer was on track as its sales decline slowed in the first quarter and it scaled back discounting and end-of-season offers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170711161227/http://news.sky.com/story/ms-says-recovery-on-track-as-sales-decline-slows-10944311,"However, he cautioned that the mood among shoppers on the high street was ""volatile"" and that consumers were ""very much shopping for now and cautious with their spend"". Like-for-like sales in the company's clothing and home division fell by 1.2% in the 13 weeks to 1 July compared to the same period last year. But that marked an improvement on the sharp 5.9% decline seen in the previous quarter. The latest figures were partly helped by the timing of Easter. Mr Rowe also said that while the overall figures showed a sales fall, full price purchases were up 7% with reduced discounting and no clearance sale. He said: ""Trading in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and we are on track with delivery of the plan we announced last year."" Meanwhile, the retailer's food business, where it is expanding its presence with the opening of more standalone Simply Food stores, saw overall revenues up strongly. However a like-for-like comparison of stores open for at least of year revealed a 0.1% decline. Earlier this year, M&S reported a 63% plunge in annual profits as costly restructuring took its toll and sales slumped in the year ending 1 April. Mr Rowe said at the time that the retailer was facing an ""uncertain economic horizon"" with consumers ""quite fragile"" - echoing concerns across the sector about the impact of accelerating inflation and stuttering wage growth on household finances. The chief executive, a company veteran who became boss last year, has sought to turn around its fortunes with a plan that includes dozens of stores being closed or scaled back as well as hundreds of head office job cuts. He has also poached Halfords boss Jill McDonald to lead its clothing, home and beauty division from this autumn and revealed plans for a small-scale trial of online food sales. In May, M&S cheered investors with the appointment of former Asda boss Archie Norman as its next chairman. The latest trading update comes as wider industry figures showed a pick-up for sales growth in June with the arrival of summer. Like-for-like sales rose by 1.2% compared to the same month last year according to the data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG. However the report said the growth in retail spending was mainly the result of higher food prices with shoppers more cautious about splashing out on non-essentials. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""There's a question mark over whether this spending momentum will last, as household expenditure is increasingly squeezed from rising inflation and slowing wage growth."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Overall conditions for high street retailers remain pretty grim, with consumer purses under pressure and competition coming from all angles. ""M&S is swimming quite hard against this tide, so it deserves some credit for treading water."""
2017-07-11,"Mike Ashley arrived at court wearing a black suit, white shirt and black tie, and then spent the afternoon talking about a rival called Mr Blue.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170711161227/http://news.sky.com/story/court-case-sheds-light-on-the-world-of-mike-ashley-10938378,"It was rather as if Reservoir Dogs had come to the High Court, but with a focus on booze and business instead of guns and violence. Mr Ashley spent the morning listening intently, as he has for most of this case. As luck would have it, I sat almost directly behind him in Court 26, watching him fiddle with his tie, yawn occasionally and share a word with his lawyer, Justin Barnes. But mostly, he listened to the testimony of the bankers with whom he'd shared a pub. Mr Ashley was prepared. He brought in the following: a spiral-bound notebook, two blue biros, two highlighters (one yellow, one orange), two packs of post-it notes and his spectacles. Over the course of nearly three hours, I didn't see him make a single note. :: Mike Ashley tells court: I'm no Obi-Wan Kenobi He also had two bottles of mineral water and a small Nokia mobile phone. I know he has a Nokia because he later revealed that he favours one particular model. When I looked it up, the model was described as being a rather unexceptional, and not very smart, budget design, but Mr Ashley doesn't mind. He has a box of them that once contained 50 handsets, but now has only half as many. ""Periodically I lose, destroy, damage or have my phone stolen,"" he told the court. ""Whatever happens to a mobile phone happens to mine."" He doesn't need a very smart phone because it turns out he only reads a few of the emails that are sent to him. And he doesn't send any in return. For all the intricacies of his legal dispute with Mr Blue - which largely boils down to whether pub chat is legally enforceable - the greatest attraction of Mr Ashley's testimony was watching him in action. A self-made retail genius worth more than £2bn, but who often appears tetchy, confrontational and slightly awkward in public. And so it was in court. It didn't take long before the probing of Jeffrey Chapman QC began to annoy him. Mr Ashley began to speak slowly and deliberately, as if addressing a very small child, before his temper rose. ""Are you trying to be funny?"" he asked the barrister at one point, who simply glanced up in answer. He later answered a single ""no"" to about a dozen questions in a row, but on other occasions he could barely stop talking, saying that he wanted ""to add colour"" to the debate. Take this - on the subject of Sports Direct's share price - could it be easily manipulated? Mr Ashley held his face in his hands, his spectacles propped up on top of his head, and took in a big breath. ""The City is full of clever people,"" he said, ""and it's all about the numbers."" For numbers, read financial results. ""If I've got good numbers I could turn up at a party naked and it wouldn't matter, the share price would go up. ""If I have bad numbers, then it doesn't matter if I sign up for a monastery. The share price would go down."" He swore several times, held his head in his hands another few times, but also earned a few laughs from the court. Having described the flotation of Sports Direct as ""an unmitigated disaster"", Mr Ashley (who made more than £900m from the deal) admitted that he had already been ""fabulously wealthy"", but said money had not stopped his ambition. ""What do you think I do when I get up in the morning? Just go and buy the neighbour's house?"" He paused before adding: ""I already own it."" This whole case has revolved around questions over drinking, and this was no exception. Mr Ashley said it wasn't true that he made all his business decisions while drinking ""otherwise I'd live in a pub"", but did say that he happily held management meetings in a hotel where he would have four beers before eating, and then another two - or half a bottle of wine - with the meal. He repeatedly claimed to the court that Mr Blue was ""a liar"", but was also hard on himself. ""I am as fat as a pig,"" said Mr Ashley at one point. And in his closing words of the day, he seemed almost wistful. He said people wanted him to go to thousands of ""things"" but he always advised his team ""don't roll me out"". ""I know how disappointing it is when they actually meet me,"" said Mr Ashley. ""It is a let down. They think 'Jesus, I thought I was going to meet a bright bloke'."" And with that, the day came to an end. Mr Ashley collected his pad, his pens and his budget phone and headed out. I suspect he may have gone for a pint."
2017-07-11,Almost a month after the Grenfell fire police have confirmed that 255 survivors escaped the tower.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170711161227/http://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-255-people-escaped-deadly-blaze-police-say-10944173,"Giving an update on the criminal investigation, Scotland Yard said officers still believe that 80 people died in the blaze. Thirty-two victims have been identified, with 55 post-mortem examinations having taken place. Detectives say that due to the damage caused by the fire some bodies may never be identified. Commander Stuart Cundy said officers are painstakingly searching through tons of debris and devastation by hand and, because of this, the recovery will take a significant period of time. ""The devastation that the intense fire left behind is phenomenal,"" he said. ""We will be doing everything we can as quickly as we can and with as much dignity as we can to recover all those that died in the fire and return them to their loved ones."" Families of those who died are still waiting for answers and have told Sky News of their frustration and anger at the lack of information they have had from police about the criminal inquiry. Nabil Choucair lost six members of his family in the fire: his sister Nadia, her husband Basim, their three daughters and his mother. He said his trauma has been compounded by a vacuum of official information. He said: ""We want to know... we're trying to find out everything we can about what last information there is about our family. ""It's very important. It's the only thing that we have left."" Another family member still searching for answers is Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle Hesham Rahman lived on the top floor of the tower. After trawling through social media for information about what happened, Mr Mussilhy and his family understand Mr Rahman died while comforting two small children. But they have had no official confirmation of his death and are concerned that the police have not made any arrests or named any suspects as part of the investigation into the blaze. ""We feel like we've been placed in the shadows. We've been given information in dribs and drabs as if they're trying to sedate us,"" he said. As the criminal investigation continues, Sky News has seen information given to families about developments in the search. It shows that 13 sets of remains have been found outside the tower - and from seven of those, six individuals have so far been identified. From the stairwell and lift lobbies, 10 recoveries of remains have been made - all from the 9th floor and above. In one flat on the 22nd floor, 13 sets of remains have been discovered - they are still unidentified. While police believe around 80 people died in the tragedy, families affected by the fire believe the death toll is much higher."

However, the company was caught high and dry when almost all of the 300,000 umbrellas it provided were stolen shortly after the scheme was launched. Sharing E Umbrella's chief executive Zhao Shuping says his idea was inspired by other share schemes like bicycle hire and the idea that now anything can be shared. But he may have overestimated people's honesty - or even their ability to simply remember to give them back. The GPS-enabled umbrellas are unlocked using a code sent to your mobile phone which allows you to use it for about 50 yuan (6p) per half an hour for as long as you want. There is apparently no penalty for not putting them back, according to local media, which may have contributed to the volume of unreturned brollies. Mr Zhao says the scheme makes money through advertising on the umbrella, saying ""the umbrella is not only a tool for shelter, it is an advertising media."" The umbrellas were rolled out in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Nanchang and although there aren't many left for a rainy day, Mr Zhao says he plans to put them into even cities more across China. Mr Zhao told the state media website The Paper that people may have broken their umbrellas, or may have hired more than one and left them at home."

Details of the UK-wide inquiry have yet to be finalised, and consultations will take place with those affected on the best way to proceed. The Prime Minister's spokesman said: ""Consultation will now take place with those affected to decide exactly what form the inquiry will take, such as a Hillsborough-style independent panel or a judge-led statutory inquiry. ""It is a tragedy that has caused immeasurable hardship and pain for all those affected and a full inquiry to establish the truth of what happened is the right course of action to take. ""It is going to be a wide-ranging inquiry."" The spokesman said the decision to hold an investigation had been prompted by new evidence. It came just hours before MPs held an emergency debate on the scandal. Speaker John Bercow granted the debate after a request from Labour MP Diana Johnson, who said ministers had failed to consider evidence of criminal activity. She said: ""Those infected, and their families, will be waiting anxiously to know that the Prime Minister's announcement will truly give them the justice they have so long been denied."" The UK imported supplies of the clotting agent Factor VIII from the US, some of which turned out to be infected. Much of the plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn welcomed the announcement, and said the inquiry should have the potential to trigger prosecutions.

The Speaker granted debate for tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/3WLM5EI1ta ""Two thousand four hundred people died as a result of this contaminated blood, and it's caused unbelievable stress to many, many more people,"" he said. ""It was obviously a serious systemic failure. I think we need the strongest possible inquiry that can if necessary lead to prosecution actions as a result, but above all get to the bottom of it."" At the weekend, Labour's Andy Burnham told Sky News he was prepared to go the police if the Government failed to act. The former health secretary, who is now mayor of Greater Manchester, said he had received ""serious allegations"" from victims and called for a public inquiry to get to the truth about what he called an ""orchestrated cover-up"". The allegations include claims that patients were not told of the risks, even after the dangers became clear. The number of dead includes many haemophiliacs who died from hepatitis C and AIDS-related illnesses after receiving contaminated blood products from the NHS in the 1970s and 1980s."

""I have to trust my instincts, and Harry was perfect for this part."" Ledger, who died of an accidental overdose before The Dark Night was released, won a posthumous Oscar for his role in the film. Former One Direction star Styles, 23, has a small part as a soldier in Nolan's WWII film, which is about the 1940 evacuation of Allied troops from the French shores. Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy star in the film. Neither Rylance nor Nolan really knew who Styles was before the casting, with the veteran actor telling The Hollywood Reporter it was his niece who told him of Styles' fame. ""She was just more excited than anything I've ever done because I was going to be acting with Harry Styles,"" he said. As for Nolan, he said he had ""heard his name"" from his children but ""wasn't very familiar with him"". ""What I was seeing was a very charismatic guy who clearly had a truthfulness and a subtlety in his ability to perform as a film actor,"" the Oscar-nominated director said.

Kang is accused of copying secret documents in 2015 and trying to pass them to Islamic State through what turned out to be undercover FBI agents. It is also alleged that he made combat training videos intended for IS fighters. SWAT team special agents arrested him on Saturday, following an investigation that lasted for more than a year. His father, Clifford Kang, said he was ""a great kid, a normal kid"". ""He told me he was with the Muslim faith now, I'm a Catholic so figured well, that's alright,"" he said. ""I know there are good teachings of the Muslim faith and the bad and from time to time when he did live here he would teach me the Koran.

According to his military service record, he was an air traffic control operator at Wheeler Army Airfield (also in Honolulu) and held the rank of Sergeant First Class. Concerns had previously been raised about Kang's possible radicalisation. His military clearance was revoked in 2012 for pro-IS comments at work and threatening his colleagues. The clearance was re-instated the following year. But the Army told the FBI in 2016 that they feared he was becoming radicalised, asking the bureau to investigate. The FBI has said they believe he was a ""lone actor"" and that no documents made it into the hands of IS. He made a brief appearance at court on Monday and will face a detention hearing on Thursday. Kang's lawyer Birney Bervar said he had only been able to talk to his client for a few minutes so did not yet know much about the case."

Both parents interrupted proceedings and aired concerns about their son's case directly to Mr Justice Francis. He told them he wanted to know what had changed with the 11-month-old's condition and said he would make decisions on the basis of ""clear evidence"". ""I will hear new evidence. I am not going to rake over facts,"" the judge said, adding he would analyse the case ""calmly and fairly"". Grant Armstrong, representing Charlie's parents, said there was ""encouraging"" evidence from researchers at the Vatican's children's hospital about an experimental treatment. However, lawyers representing Great Ormond Street Hospital and a guardian appointed to independently represent Charlie's interests told Mr Justice Francis they were struggling to find any new evidence. Following the hearing, Gard family spokesman Alasdair Seton-Marsden, said: ""If Charlie is still fighting, (his parents) are still fighting."" Earlier, Ms Yates told Sky News that the experimental treatment could be a ""miracle"" for her son. She said that if the medication works Charlie ""could potentially be a normal boy again"". ""There are 18 children currently on this treatment - one of them wasn't able to do anything and now she's riding a bike,"" she said. Ms Yates added that she hoped judges would listen to experts and ""give us a chance"". She said: ""We're not saying Great Ormond Street is a bad hospital but they don't have a specialist for his particular condition. ""We don't see what's dignified about him dying - we think it's dignified that he has a chance at life and if it doesn't work then we'll let him go."" Dr Trevor Stammers, lecturer in bioethics and medical law at St Mary's University, told Sky News the Vatican's evidence has to prove the experimental treatment has ""some chance of conferring benefit"". He said: ""It seems that if he remains at Great Ormond Street it seems that almost certainly his life support will be withdrawn and clearly he is likely then to die. ""I agree that if there is even a small chance on the basis of this evidence then the presumption and legal precedent on these cases is that the judgment ought to be given in favour of preserving and prolonging life - but we don't know precisely what the nature of that evidence is yet.""

She told Sky News: ""The case is so finely balanced you could argue it either way. In this case, the wishes of the parents ought to be respected."" Charlie suffers from mitochondrial disease and has brain damage. His parents want him to undergo an experimental treatment in the US or Italy. A GoFundMe page set up to raise money for his treatment has so far raised more than £1.3m.

And thanks to the extraordinary five-set epic which saw Rafael Nadal sent home to Majorca by Gilles Muller, the 16th seed from Luxembourg, the agonies are set to run into Tuesday evening. Novak Djokovic, who waited and waited through those four hours and 48 minutes and never did get to play, will now start Tuesday's Centre Court programme against Adrian Mannarino. That means Jo Konta's first Wimbledon quarter-final against Romanian second seed Simona Halep is moved back to the third match on the sport's most hallowed turf. The first British woman in a quarter-final here since Jo Durie in 1984, Konta said: ""It's very exciting. It's another step forward to being involved in the event for the full two weeks."" She beat French 21st seed Caroline Garcia in three sets. Konta and Halep have history. The British number one was in tears at what she felt was intimidation from Romanian fans in Constanta during a Davis Cup match in April. Romania coach Ilie Nastase was sent from the court after calling Konta and his British counterpart Anne Keothavong ""bitches"". He is banned from Wimbledon as a result. Halep reiterated here after her fourth round victory that she believed the crowd in Constanta were fair. Konta retorted anyone who thought that ""was not in my shoes"". As if any more spice were needed, Halep will become world number one if she wins on Tuesday. Not since Roger Taylor and Virginia Wade in 1973 have Britain celebrated quarter-finalists in both the men's and women's singles at Wimbledon. Taylor was in the Royal Box as Andy Murray saw off the bushy-bearded Frenchman Benoit Paire in straight sets on Monday. Murray, who plays big-serving American Sam Querrey on Wednesday, has in theory an easier path to the final after Nadal's extraordinary exit. He cannot face either Djokovic or Roger Federer before the final on Sunday. British dreams are gathering momentum."

While Theresa May continues to insist she is staying put in Downing Street, the timing of the visit may depend on how long she survives as Prime Minister. The President said during the G20 summit in Hamburg last weekend that he and the Prime Minister had developed a ""very special relationship"". It was reported last week that the President might make an unannounced visit to the UK at short notice after the G20 summit, possibly to one of his golf courses. But the White House spokesman Sean Spicer later dismissed those reports, saying: ""While he looks forward to visiting the UK, it will not be in the next two weeks."" The PM invited President Trump to visit the UK during her visit to Washington in January when their talks at the White House were overshadowed by pictures of him holding her hand. But after the Commons Speaker John Bercow effectively vetoed a speech by the President to Parliament, a petition opposing the visit was signed by 1.85 million people and protest groups threatened mass demonstrations, the visit appeared to have been postponed indefinitely. Significantly, there was no mention of a Trump state visit in the Queen's Speech opening a session of Parliament due to last two years, suggesting the visit had been postponed until 2019 at the earliest. But after a 50-minute meeting with Theresa May during the G20 summit at the weekend, the President insisted he ""will be going to London"". Asked when, he replied: ""We'll work that out."" If the President is to make an unofficial visit to the UK before his official state visit, dropping in on one of his golf courses in Scotland would appear to be one option.

2017-07-11,"A long-awaited review into Uber-style employment represents the biggest 'reset' for workers for a generation, its author has told Sky News - but critics say it does not go far enough.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170711161227/http://news.sky.com/story/gig-economy-review-will-not-shift-balance-of-power-for-workers-10944149,"Matthew Taylor, head of the Royal Society of Arts and a former adviser to Tony Blair, unveiled a series of proposals that aim to ensure all work is ""fair and decent"" and defended the review against critics who said it was ""feeble"". The report was commissioned last year by Theresa May amid concerns about the practices of companies operating in the so-called gig economy such as Uber and Deliveroo. It cites figures estimating that 1.3 million work in this part of the economy. Mr Taylor told Sky News: ""If all the recommendations are carried out - and that would be a hard and complex process and it will take some time - it will be the biggest reset of employment law for the most vulnerable workers that we've seen in a generation."" A key aim of the review has been to address fears about the treatment of those employed on zero hours contracts. Mrs May, speaking at its launch, acknowledged that it was important to ensure that employers ""do not use these contracts to exploit people"". She said the Government would study its recommendations carefully and respond in detail later in the year. But Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said it missed the chance for major reform to help those in insecure work and could pave the way for a loss of rights for Uber workers that had been won in the courts. The CBI said some of the proposals would be ""of significant concern to businesses"". Mr Taylor's review calls for a new category of worker called ""dependent contractor"" to be created to bolster rights to sick pay and holiday pay, covering those who do not currently enjoy full employment rights. Uber said in a statement that it would welcome ""greater clarity in the law over different types of employment status"". Deliveroo said the review was a chance to make the law ""fit for the 21st century"" but warned that ""any moves to restrict flexibility could undermine the very thing that attracts people to work in this sector"". The report also says workers should be given the right to request fixed hours and permanent contracts, though it stops short of calling for a blanket minimum wage right to be extended to them. Instead it calls for two-way flexibility on pay, with companies having to pay at least the minimum wage in exchange for a contractor working during busy periods. In addition, the review calls for a move away from ""cash-in-hand"" payments to tradesmen, addressing a practice thought to cost the Treasury £6.2bn a year in lost tax revenue. Mr Taylor said the proposals aimed to help people told to be ready for work only to be told none is available or ""who spent years working for a company on zero hour contracts but who without a guarantee of hours from week to week can't get a mortgage or a loan"". Others might feel that if they raised legitimate workplace concerns for fear they might be denied the hours ""that they so desperately need"". Mr Taylor sought to reassure ""good employers"" that they had nothing to fear and said there was ""nothing wrong with zero hours contracts"" - but that they must not be used as a ""lazy way"" for companies for transfer risk onto the shoulders of their workers. ""Bad work - insecure, exploitative, controlling - is bad for health and wellbeing, something that generates cost for vulnerable individuals, but also for wider society,"" he added. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady, said the review would prompt a ""sigh of relief"" from gig economy employers. Thompsons Solicitors' chief executive Stephen Cavalier said the recommendations were ""feeble and add another layer of unnecessary complexity"". Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said Mr Taylor had ""got the balance right"". But Neil Carberry, CBI managing director for people and infrastructure, said: ""Changes to the application of the minimum wage, rewriting employment status tests and altering agency worker rules could have unintended consequences that are negative for individuals, as well as affecting firms' ability to create new jobs."""
2017-07-11,There's no doubt Theresa May is still fighting for her political life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170711161227/http://news.sky.com/story/five-ways-jeremy-corbyn-could-take-power-10944658,"The Prime Minister is battling on a number of fronts, with some saying her leadership and credibility are in tatters. Her Conservative minority government - propped up by the DUP - is in a fragile position and faces many challenges in Parliament - not least on Britain's exit from the European Union. But has her election disaster left the door open for Jeremy Corbyn to enter Number 10? We take a look at several scenarios which could precipitate another general election in which the Labour leader could take power. :: Losing a key vote Mrs May's gamble of a snap election to win a Brexit mandate horribly backfired, leaving her with a working majority of just 13 - 10 of those votes reliant on the Democratic Unionist Party's lawmakers. It only takes seven Conservative MPs to turn a rebellion into a loss of majority for the Government and the DUP - or even a small number of absences through illness or travel delays. This would also require a considerable amount of planning on the part of the opposition parties to organise a potential defeat of a key legislative Bill by ganging up on the Tories and DUP - but it is plausible. Key manifesto pledges to change the triple lock on pensions, to means-test the winter fuel allowance and bring back fox hunting and grammar schools have already been sacrificed to see off such a threat. Labour has claimed Mrs May's programme is in ""tatters"". ""Theresa May does not have a mandate for continued cuts to our schools, hospitals, police and other vital public services or for a race-to-the-bottom Brexit,"" Mr Corbyn was warned. ""Labour will fight these policies every step of the way."" :: Vote of no confidence The Conservative Party is ruthless with losers - and the PM's benches will be watching her performance closely following her botched election campaign. While some Tories have called for calm, warning the party needs another leadership election ""like a hole in the head"", rivals may wait for Mrs May's not so strong and stable leadership to fail. Only 15% of Tory MPs would need to back a no confidence vote in the Prime Minister to trigger a leadership contest - this means just 48 members of her minority government turning against her. Even if this were to happen, it does not mean an immediate election. The nation did not go to the polls when Mrs May replaced David Cameron last year. In addition, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act remains in place - which means a two-thirds vote of the House of Commons is required to secure an early dissolution - so both main parties need to be on side for it to happen. In other words, a majority of MPs must pass a motion saying ""this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government"". Given Labour's recent surge in the polls and Mr Corbyn's rising popularity making him the favourite to win, why would the Conservatives - or a new Tory PM - want another election anytime in the near future? All parties would have two weeks to form another government. If that failed, another election would be called. In any case, Mrs May's downfall, however, would set off a chain of events making another election inevitable. :: Could Brexit trigger an early election? Well, it triggered the June poll! Mrs May's catastrophic gamble to win a Brexit mandate has left her party split over the issue. While the Cabinet Brexiteers have been boosted by the return of Michael Gove, Tory Remainers have been flexing their muscles since the election result and there are growing doubts whether her version of a ""hard"" Brexit will happen at all. She is facing a wider bid to water down her Brexit plans by a cross-party group set up to fight against a ""hard"" Brexit. The all-party parliamentary group on EU relations is co-chaired by Chuka Umunna, who recently led a Labour revolt over Brexit by calling for the UK to stay in the single market, and prominent Remain campaigner and Conservative MP Anna Soubry. The Repeal Bill - which will replicate all existing EU law into British law by the time of Britain's departure from the EU - is expected to be tabled when Parliament returns in the autumn and will provide a crucial test for the Government's ability to get key measures through. In addition, she is also facing pressure over her plan to quit Europe's nuclear regulator Euratom because it is under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - whose influence over the UK she has highlighted as a ""red line"" in her Brexit negotiations. At least nine Tory MPs have indicated they are against this, and according to Sky's Political Editor Faisal Islam, on this issue, at least, the implications appear toxic for the Prime Minister's chance of a majority. Mr Corbyn is facing splits in his own party over Brexit as well - highlighted earlier this month when 49 Labour MPs defied him and party policy by voting in favour of an amendment tabled by Mr Umunna calling for Britain to remain in the single market. But it is Mrs May who is in the driving seat (at least for now) and in her own words, facing ""a different reality"" a year on since becoming Tory leader, and her plea to Mr Corbyn and Labour to come to her aid on Brexit has fallen on deaf ears. Mr Corbyn has rejected and mocked her appeal for cross-party cooperation on government policy making, and instead demanded a fresh election if her government has run out of ideas. :: The Democratic Unionist Party walks away The confidence and supply deal worth £1.5bn agreed with the Conservatives means the DUP's 10 MPs will support the Government on key votes in the Commons - including the event of a no confidence vote. The pact prevents Mrs May's minority government from being ""ambushed"" - as described by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The deal is not binding - unlike the formal 2010 coalition between the Tories and Liberal Democrats. However, it is in the interests of the Northern Irish parliamentary kingmakers to keep their part of the deal and prop up Mrs May's premiership. Under the arrangement, about £1bn in ""new money"" has been earmarked for Northern Ireland, as well as greater flexibility over £500m already allocated to the country. Mrs May has survived several crucial Commons tests already - including a majority vote for her Queen's Speech - thanks to the DUP's support. The DUP has also reportedly pledged to support Mrs May's government ""for as long as Jeremy Corbyn is leader of the Labour Party"". The likelihood of Mr Corbyn being ousted on the back of a significant post-election boost for Labour is slim. :: Another General Election The most likely way Mr Corbyn could enter Number 10 is if there was a fresh election. Just hours after the June poll results were declared, Mr Corbyn called on Mrs May to resign, declaring he was ""ready to serve the country"". It is impossible to say how long the PM will last at Number 10. Minority administrations have an unhappy history and Mrs May will be wary of the fate that has befallen others before her, including the cricket-loving former PM John Major who also relied on the support of Ulster Unionist Party MPs. In 1992, Mr Major won a majority of 21, but found himself leading a minority government from December 1996 due to a combination of by-election losses and defections. His minority government limped on until May 1997 when the Conservatives were swept away in a landslide by Tony Blair's Labour, sealing Mr Major's fate. Mrs May said at almost every election campaign rally that if she lost just six seats she would have lost the election. In the end her party recorded a net loss of 13 seats. Mr Corbyn's Labour surged to 261 seats - up 29 from its tally in the 2015 election. She is still in Downing Street, but her minority government does not wield much power. If key legislation is repeatedly voted down in Parliament, the country could be going to the polls again very soon, with Mr Corbyn odds-on favourite to become the next PM."

Oliver's great aunt, Liz Ryan, said he was playing with friends when ""he went in the water to save a girl and help her get out"". Explaining that ""he couldn't swim much himself"", she went on: ""We don't know the full story but all we know is that he is a hero. He didn't think of himself."" She added: ""They were told not to go - 'don't go playing down the weir' - and obviously that's what they do."" Nottingham Police were called to the lock off Riverside Road at around 6pm on Monday night when Oliver was reported missing. Police divers, three search boats, a helicopter, a drone and more than 30 firefighters from Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire were involved in the search. Hundreds of members of the public also came out, searching until dark when helicopters with infrared cameras were sent out. The body was discovered in the water at around 10pm. Owen's grandmother and her husband said the boy's father spent the whole night sitting by the weir where the tragedy happened. Lynda Fletcher said: ""He was like a giraffe, he was nearly 6ft tall. He was just a friendly giant. ""Everybody loved him because he was so nice. They loved him because he was so kind and polite."" Nottingham Casuals RFC Rugby Union club, where Owen had played since he was seven-years-old, said: ""We cannot express how deep our sorrow is and our thoughts are with Owen's Family and friends."" They went on to say he ""was loved [by] his team mates and everyone he came into contact with""."
2017-07-11,"Boris Johnson has said the sums of money the EU is proposing to demand from Britain for Brexit ""seem to be extortionate"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170711161227/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-eus-exit-bill-demand-extortionate-10944564,"When asked in the Commons whether Brussels should be told to ""go whistle"" if it wants more money from Britain, the Foreign Secretary said: ""I think that the sums that I have seen ... seem to me to be extortionate and I think go whistle is an entirely appropriate expression."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Mr Johnson of being ""arrogant"" and said the ""silly remarks"" were counter-productive. ""Go whistle"" is a phrase that means asking for something with little chance of getting it. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested the final bill, which covers outstanding liabilities for programmes the UK signed up to as an EU member and ongoing costs for things like staff pensions, could be around £50bn. Unconfirmed reports have claimed the final figure could be almost twice that amount. The EU has put Britain's so-called ""exit bill"" at tens of billions of euros, partly to cover a share of future EU budget commitments made while it was a member. Mr Johnson also said the Government has not made any plans for a ""no deal"" Brexit because the UK will get a ""great deal"" in the negotiations. This contradicts Brexit Secretary David Davis, who said in June: ""We have worked up that alternative in some detail. We are still working on it. ""Not because we want to, but in government you have to, if you are responsible, work up every contingency."" Number 10 sources have played down suggestions Prime Minister Theresa May plans to walk away from Brexit talks in September in a show of defiance over EU demands for Britain to pay a hefty exit bill. Mr Johnson said the public wanted the Government to ""get on and deliver a great Brexit"" and dismissed claims from Labour former shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn that there was division in the Conservative ranks over whether the UK could leave without a deal. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry pressed him again on what ""no deal"" would mean for the public and businesses, asking if he had a ""detailed private plan"" to mitigate the risks. She said: ""It is slightly baffling, as it is the Prime Minister, or at least the Prime Minister for now, who decided to put the no deal option on the table and she couldn't stop using the phrase during the election campaign. ""Now when we ask what it means in practice, they refuse to tell us."" Mr Johnson said the chances of Britain walking away from the talks without a deal were ""vanishingly thin"" as it was in the interest of EU member states to secure a good deal. He replied: ""There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal and just for the sake of example and illustration, I would remind you that there was a time ... when Britain was not in the Common Market."" Mr Corbyn said: ""I think it is ridiculous for the Foreign Secretary to approach important and serious negotiations with that silly, arrogant language that he so often employs. ""Treat people with respect and there's a fair chance you will be treated with respect in return. ""If you start on the basis of those silly remarks, what kind of response does he expect to get?"" Mr Corbyn is due to meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels on Thursday to set out Labour's approach to Brexit. He said the party would ""pay what we are legally required to pay"", but nothing beyond that."

The dead man has been named by police Jamie Lee, 22, who died from a gunshot wound on Sunday evening at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in the city. A 62-year-old was also shot and in a serious condition but has now been discharged from hospital, along with the four others who were injured. Detective Superintendent Allan Burton said: ""This is clearly a worrying incident for local residents and families who live nearby, but I want to assure people that this level of violence in our communities will not be tolerated and we will be using every available resource to arrest those responsible for these violent attacks.

Bodies were reported to have fallen on Highway 82, more than a mile from the crash site, and debris found up to five miles (8km) away. Local catfish farmer Andy Jones described the force of the crash as ""nearly flattening the plane"", which he said could barely be seen above the waist-high bean crop. Witnesses were unable to approach the wreckage due to the intensity of the fire. Firefighters sprayed the aircraft with layers of foam to put out the flames, until an explosion forced them back from the area. The fire chief described the blaze - which he said was ""punctuated by the pops of small explosions"" - as ""one of the worst fires you can imagine"". Large plumes of smoke were visible for miles across the region, with the fire continuing to burn for more than four hours after the crash. A Marine Corps spokeswoman said the KC-130 Hercules transport aircraft - which was used as a refuelling tanker - had ""experienced a mishap"".

2017-07-11,Some of the world's largest internet companies are preparing to join in a day of protest against the United States' Federal Communications Commission (FCC).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170711161227/http://news.sky.com/story/amazon-and-netflix-to-throttle-services-in-net-neutrality-protest-10944338,"The 170 organisations involved - including Amazon, Reddit and Netflix - are preparing to alter how their services are displayed on Wednesday 12 July as a warning against FCC proposals for deregulating how internet service providers (ISPs) treat customers. While it isn't clear exactly what measures the internet companies will use to protest, it could mean, for example, slower loading times for users, as well as altering the appearance of their sites. The websites for Amazon and Netflix will display a message explaining that their sites could be slower because of the deregulation - but there is no plan to throttle the sites, as others may do. The protesters allege the proposed deregulation would ""destroy net neutrality and give big cable companies control over what we see and do online"" - but what exactly is net neutrality? Net neutrality is a term coined in 2003 to describe the principle that ISPs should treat all of the data they're providing to customers equally, and not to use their own infrastructure to block out competitors. In a fairly classical regulatory brouhaha, most of the big cable companies which the protest movement think would be at liberty to act maliciously have come forward in support of the FCC's proposals. However, all of those companies state that they are supporters of net neutrality and that the protest movement is mistaken in its opposition to the FCC's plans. :: What are the FCC's plans? The FCC's chairman, Ajit Pai, expressed his desire to remove a rule called the Open Internet Order, which had been put in place under the Obama administration. One specific part of the Open Internet Order called Title II established that broadband should be a particularly regulated service - and that ISPs were required to maintain internet connections of a certain speed to everything that their customers wished to access. Announcing the proposal to deregulate, Mr Pai described the internet as ""the greatest free-market success story in history. ""But two years ago, the federal government's approach suddenly changed. The FCC, on a party-line vote, decided to impose a set of heavy-handed regulations upon the internet. ""It decided to slap an old regulatory framework called 'Title II' - originally designed in the 1930s for the Ma Bell telephone monopoly - upon thousands of internet service providers, big and small."" This was ""all about politics"" said Mr Pai before arguing that the increased regulatory burden was reducing investment in broadband infrastructure. This notion has received considerable support from cable companies such as Comcast, whose senior executive vice president, David Cohen, wrote: ""While some try to conflate the two issues, Title II and net neutrality are not the same. ""Title II is a source of authority to impose enforceable net neutrality rules. Title II is not net neutrality. Getting rid of Title II does not mean that we are repealing net neutrality protections for American consumers."" Not everybody agrees, however. :: What's going to happen? The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a leading digital civil liberties organisation, claims that more than 40 ISPs across the US have written to the FCC to explain that Title II has not hurt their ability to develop and expand their networks. The EFF has been an active participant in these protests whenever they have occurred before. In 2012, an online protest included Google and Wikipedia replacing their websites with pages protesting the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect IP Act (PIPA). The result of this protest was considerable, with lobbying leading to two of PIPA's sponsors withdrawing their support for the bill, including a man who would later seek Presidential nomination from the Republican Party, Marco Rubio. Another slowdown in 2014 took place to highlight net neutrality issues. The organisation behind that protest claimed that more than 2,030,000 individuals took part in it, sending over 2,300,000 emails to members of Congress to convince their legislators to protect net neutrality. The ultimate result of that protest? It was the FCC adopting the very same Open Internet Order which Mr Pai is now proposing to replace."

The BRDC's move means the last contracted race would be in 2019 unless a new deal is agreed. More than 135,000 F1 fans are due at the circuit on Sunday as Lewis Hamilton bids for a fourth successive British GP win. ""It's not financially viable for us to deliver the British Grand Prix under the terms of our current contract,"" BRDC John Grant told a news conference at the track. ""We have reached the tipping point where we can no longer let our passion for the sport rule our heads."" The BRDC has been the custodian of the British GP for 70 years, but their decision drew a strong response from the sport's owners, the F1 Group. They said: ""We offered to extend the current deadlines in order to focus on everything that's great about Silverstone and F1. ""Regretfully the Silverstone management has chosen to look for a short term advantage to benefit their position. Our focus is still to preserve the British Grand Prix."" Under the current deal, the BRDC pay around £17m to host the race, which increases by 5% each year - and would cost £25m by 2026. An adult general admission ticket for race day costs £185 and £92.50 for a child's under-16 ticket. Seated tickets in the stands can run into the hundreds of pounds. New countries like Russia, Azerbaijan and Bahrain pay up to £40m to host an F1 race, but Silverstone is the only circuit on the race calendar that receives no government funding. 1950 was the last year that saw no British Grand Prix on the F1 calendar."

It relates to sales to US government-backed loan firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac prior to the 2008 financial crisis, when RBS was among the biggest players on Wall Street. The bank is yet to agree a separate deal with the US Department of Justice, which could be higher. RBS said that while it had largely made enough provision for the FHFA penalty, it would take an additional charge in its second quarter of £151m to cover the cost. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, said: ""Today's announcement is an important step forward in resolving one of the most significant legacy matters facing RBS and is further evidence of the determination of the bank's leadership to put our remaining issues behind us. ""This settlement is a stark reminder of what happened to this bank before the financial crisis, and the heavy price paid for its pursuit of global ambitions."" It marked the 17th settlement with a financial institution for the FHFA in the matter. RBS shares were 2% up on the news as shareholders saw the penalty as another step towards the bank's recovery. It remains more than 70% owned by the public purse as rival Lloyds is back in private hands. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has signalled that RBS needs to resolve many of its legacy issues before a share sale can be considered. Before the general election, Mr Hammond said fair value for the stake could be below the 502p paid by the Labour government in 2008. They are currently trading below 260p."

While cracks happen periodically - and this one is believed to have been a natural event - experts are also watching to see whether the process has been affected or accelerated by global warming. Researchers at the university had warned in June that the vast iceberg was ""hanging by a thread"" and close to breaking off. The breakaway section - more than a quarter of the size of Wales - changes the landscape of the peninsula forever, scientists said. The release of the new iceberg - called calving - was detected by a NASA satellite and poses a potential risk to cruise liners and shipping traffic in the peninsula. It has reduced the size of the Larcen C ice shelf by 12% and experts fear it may disintegrate - as did its previous neighbour the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002. As the iceberg was floating before it snapped, it is thought the break will have no immediate impact on sea level. Professor Adrian Luckman, spearheading the monitoring project, said: ""We have been anticipating this event for months, and have been surprised how long it took for the rift to break through the final few kilometres of ice. ""We will continue to monitor both the impact of this calving event on the Larsen C ice shelf, and the fate of this huge iceberg. ""The iceberg is one of the largest recorded and its future progress is difficult to predict. It may remain in one piece but is more likely to break into fragments. ""Some of the ice may remain in the area for decades, while parts of the iceberg may drift north into warmer waters."" His colleague Dr Martin O'Leary added: ""Although this is a natural event, and we're not aware of any link to human-induced climate change, this puts the ice shelf in a very vulnerable position. ""This is the furthest back that the ice front has been in recorded history. ""We're going to be watching very carefully for signs that the rest of the shelf is becoming unstable."" Larsen C is 350 metres thick and is the largest and most northerly of the Antarctic ice shelves."
2017-07-12,A police sergeant leading the operation to identify victims inside Grenfell Tower has said it could take four months or more before their work is complete.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/search-for-grenfell-tower-victims-may-take-four-months-relatives-warned-10945297,"Alistair Hutchins has urged grieving families to be patient as his teams assess tonnes of debris across each of the 24 floors left ravaged by fire on 14 June. Twelve officers who specialise in disaster victim identification (DVI) are continuing to scour the building, along with 24 search-trained officers and six archaeologists. They are split into four to six teams - working for three-hour stints as they negotiate up to 23 flights of stairs. Each wear protective clothing and respiratory equipment to shield them against asbestos in the building. At least 80 people are thought to have died in the fire, but that number could rise. Footage released by the Metropolitan Police has shown the conditions faced by the DVI team, with one officer seen pausing for breath as they go up the tower block. Floor numbers have been spray painted on to the blackened walls inside to help the officers keep track of where they are. Sergeant Hutchins explained the painstaking fingertip searches under way at each flat, with officers using 6mm sieves to detect small fragments of bone and teeth which can be used to help identify the victims. He acknowledged that families are frustrated about the lack of information they are receiving, but added: ""All I say is please be patient. We are doing our utmost best for you and we are working as hard as we can. ""My teams can't work any harder, but we are trying our very best to get your loved ones back."" Hours after the blaze began four weeks ago, Sergeant Hutchins and a colleague were the first officers from the DVI unit to enter the block and develop a strategy for recovering those still inside - including pets. The officer described the intense smoke and heat around them as firefighters tackled the inferno in near darkness, with hot water pouring down the stairs ""like a waterfall"". Immediately after Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday afternoon, MPs will gather in the Commons for a debate on the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster. A spokesman for the inquiry, which is being chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, has said survivors of the fire are going to be given more time to make their case about which issues the investigation should consider."

He has now tweeted emails relating to the meeting - and his father has lauded him as a ""high-quality person"" while praising his ""transparency"". The White House branded talk of perjury and treason over alleged links to Moscow as ""ridiculous"", adding the President is ""frustrated"" Russia continues to be an issue and would love to move on. Mr Trump Jr revealed he had been in contact with the lawyer over an offer to provide his father's presidential campaign with ""official documents and information"" that would ""incriminate"" Democratic rival Mrs Clinton and ""her dealings with Russia"". The offer of ""very high-level and sensitive information"" was described to Mr Trump Jr as ""very useful to your father"", and claimed to be ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump"". :: Donald Trump Jr emails 'tip of iceberg' over Russia scandal The information was said to be from the ""crown prosecutor of Russia"", with Mr Trump Jr's emails revealing he was offered a meeting with a ""Russian government attorney"". In reply to the offer of ""ultra sensitive"" information on Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump Jr said: ""If it's what you say I love it."" Mr Trump Jr used his Twitter account to publish the correspondence about a controversial meeting with a Russian lawyer. In the email chain, Mr Trump Jr is shown in contact with music publicist Rob Goldstone to arrange to meet Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York, on 9 June last year. After the release of the emails, the US President said in a statement: ""My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency."" Mr Trump Jr has previously confirmed the meeting took place, which was also attended by the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chief at the time. Alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia - along with Moscow's possible meddling in the US election - are currently the focus of a number of inquiries, including a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller, an ex-FBI chief. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said the emails show the Trump campaign ""sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy"", although Republicans played down the revelations. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, called on Mr Trump Jr to hand over all documents related to contact with Russia. The emergence of Mr Trump Jr's meeting on 9 June, first revealed by the New York Times, has prompted calls for the President's son to appear before a congressional committee. Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ In a statement, also published on Twitter, Mr Trump Jr said he was releasing the emails in order to be ""totally transparent"". He said ""the woman"" he met ""had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy"" as well as Russian sanctions. Mr Trump Jr had earlier mocked the ""desperation"" of the media and Democrats over the ""nonsense meeting"". Later on Tuesday, Ms Veselnitskaya claimed she ""never had compromising information"" on Mrs Clinton and ""could not have had"". She told reporters it is ""not true"" she had information and Mr Trump Jr ""was told so"". The lawyer added she does ""not represent anyone other than myself"" and was offered a meeting with Mr Trump Jr in a ""private setting not connected to the fact that he is the son of the presidential candidate"". Ms Veselnitskaya had previously told NBC ""maybe they were looking for information"", adding: ""They wanted it so badly."" Moscow has said it had no connection with Ms Veselnitskaya. Mr Goldstone said on Monday he had set up the meeting on behalf of his client Emin Agalarov, but that it ended up being ""the most inane nonsense I've ever heard"". Mr Trump Jr said he had known Mr Agalarov, a singer from a billionaire family who once recorded a music video with the US President, since they staged the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed on Tuesday there is an ""anti-Russian bias"" in the US Congress, as he threatened ""counter actions"" against American diplomatic sanctions on Moscow. He suggested former President Barack Obama's outgoing administration had aimed to ""poison to a maximum US-Russian ties"" and create a ""trap"" for Mr Trump late last year."
2017-07-12,Ofgem is planning tougher price controls for gas and electricity distribution companies amid claims they have been making billions in excess profits - paid for by consumers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/regulator-ofgem-pushes-for-tougher-control-on-energy-network-prices-10945457,"The energy regulator's intervention - which looks ahead to the next round of controls in 2021 - will affect the price charged by energy networks to household suppliers. This is passed on to consumers and represents around a quarter of bills or a typical £251 a year. It comes as Citizens Advice blamed the regulator for allowing the network companies to make an excess £7.5bn in profit - paid for by households - over the past eight years. The charity claimed Ofgem had, in the current period of price control, overestimated the costs and risks facing network companies, allowing them to make ""sky-high profits"" that were not justified by their performance. It called for them to return £7.5bn to consumers. Ofgem admitted that their profits had been ""towards the higher end of expectations"" over the last four years, but it said customers had benefitted in the form of lower charges. Rising household energy bills have been at the top of the political agenda and during the election the Tories pledged a price cap, though the plans were absent from the Queen's Speech. Britain's Big Six energy suppliers have been the focus of anger over rising bills though the companies themselves have pointed to the effect of costs including those charged by network operators. National Grid, UK Power Networks and SSE (which also operates a ""Big Six"" household supply business) are the main players. These networks are monopolies so the regulator sets controls for the maximum amount the companies can recover to fund operations and investments. Now, Ofgem says there is clear evidence pointing towards the cost of investment required for networks being ""significantly lower"". ""Ofgem is signalling today that companies need to prepare themselves for a tougher round of price controls from 2021,"" it said. Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem's senior partner for networks, said the regulator was ""working to ensure that customers pay no more than they need to for energy networks while still benefitting from improvements in reliability and service"". He added: ""Setting tougher controls will ensure that Britain's energy networks deliver even better value for customers."" Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ""While we don't agree with its modelling and the figures it has produced, the Citizens Advice report raises some important issues about network regulation which will be addressed in the next control."""

Cromwell, who played the farmer in Babe and has featured in more than 50 films including LA Confidential and The Green Mile, blocked traffic during the demonstration in December 2015. At the time, police used bolt cutters to remove a metal harness that Cromwell, of Warwick, Orange County, and the two other protesters put around their necks at a site entrance. They were led away in handcuffs after they refused to move. Cromwell and two others were found guilty of civil disobedience at the construction site of the natural gas-fired Competitive Power Ventures power plant in Wawayanda. A spokesman for the Protect Orange County group says Cromwell and fellow activists will take part in a rally there before reporting to jail on Friday afternoon. Protesters claim the facility, 60 miles northwest of New York City, threatens the environment. They believe toxins from the plant may cause health issues and lower property value in the area. Cromwell was nominated for best supporting actor at the 1996 Academy Awards for his role in Babe."

Milligan, a former public school pupil, admitted choking and slapping the 18-year-old, as well as sending her threatening and obscene texts. Miss Drouet was found dead at her university halls in March 2016. A week before, she had consulted the university's student resident assistant bearing signs of physical harm by Milligan, but said she ""didn't want to get him into trouble"". Neither the police nor her parents were contacted following the meeting. :: Emily Drouet's parents criticise university over daughter's suicide Speaking after the sentencing, Miss Drouet's mother Fiona told Sky News: ""I'm disgusted. Angus Milligan is a danger to the public. He took our daughter and abused her in every sense of the word. ""His remorse only started when he realised the trouble he was in."" However, she added: ""He leaves court today as a convicted criminal, and that's the best punishment for him."" Mrs Drouet said domestic violence needed to be treated with ""harsher sentences"" and that courts should be showing ""zero tolerance"". Miss Drouet's father Germain said: ""We are broken as a family, we are broken as people. ""Many questions will never be answered, but we'll try our hardest to bring the truth to light and protect other girls."" In a family statement read outside Aberdeen Sherrif Court, Mrs Drouet said Milligan had been ""unmasked as a vicious abuser"" who ""prayed on Emily's innocence and kindness"". She said: ""Emily was studying law because she believed in justice and wanted to make a difference. Today marks her first legal victory. ""Angus Milligan's last visit to Emily was minutes before she died. We can only hope that by telling Emily's story, no young woman will have to suffer at Angus Milligan's hands again.""

2017-07-12,"Taking money out of pension pots early has become the ""new norm"" for Britons but action may be needed to help protect some from losing out, the City watchdog has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/drawing-down-pensions-early-is-the-new-norm-fca-10945784,"A study by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said 72% of retirement funds that had been accessed were by consumers under 65. It said a quarter who take out the full amount are splashing out on new cars, home repairs or other purchases. Most were choosing to take lump sums rather than a regular income, it found, and they were increasingly doing so without taking advice. The watchdog has been looking into how the retirement landscape has changed since the launch of pension freedoms in 2015. These were designed to give over-55s more choice about how they use their pension pot, rather than simply requiring them to buy an annuity, or fixed income for life. The FCA said drawing down the money had become increasingly popular, with twice as many pension pots moving into drawdown funds - which give flexibility about how much can be taken out - as annuities. :: Why there are concerns over Osborne's reforms Most of those drawing down their entire pensions savings were those with relatively small pots below £30,000, the study found. Most also had other sources of retirement income. The FCA also said people who withdrew their funds did so partly because they did not trust pensions, with the majority moving them into other savings or investments. ""This can result in consumers paying too much tax, missing out on investment growth or losing out on other benefits,"" said the watchdog. Of those fully withdrawing savings, 14% spent the largest share to pay off mortgage or other debt. 25% used it for home repairs, a car or other purchases, while 32% saved most of it and 20% invested in property, a business, or in bonds or stocks. The FCA also raised concerns about consumers not shopping around. Meanwhile, drawdowns were increasingly being made without taking advice. Before the freedoms were introduced in 2015, only 5% of funds being drawn down were without advice, compared to 30% now. ""Drawdown is complex and these consumers may need more support and protection,"" the FCA said. Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the watchdog, said: ""Since the introduction of pension freedoms, the retirement market has changed substantially. ""We have identified areas where early intervention may be needed either now or further down the track to put the market on the best footing for the future."""

Eddie was immediately overwhelmed with requests from keen social media users, but seemed totally unfazed by their abstract nature. Hi, Eddie here! Here on Work Experience and ready to answer your questions! 😊 Adam Winstone asked: ""Would you rather fight 1 horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses?"" Eddie replied: ""100 duck-sized horses. A horse-sized duck would be pretty scary! You? ^Eddie"" Another odd request from Duncan Ingrim read: ""Hey Eddie, do you think Jon Snow is going to meet Daenerys and Tyrion and rule Westeros?"" Eddie doled out the joke: ""I'm sorry. I never get a chance to watch Channel 4 news. ^Eddie"" I'm sorry. I never get a chance to watch Channel 4 news. ^Eddie Perhaps wisely, he declined Rahul Desai's request to offer his thoughts on rail nationalisation. Southern Rail's recent history has been blighted by long-running industrial action that has seen many services cancelled and delayed. During the course of the day, Eddie was offered more work experience at ScotRail, spawned the hashtag #askeddie and encouraged to be given a permanent job running the account. A British Transport Police account added: ""We think Eddie deserves a permanent position! He is smashing it!"" But the schoolboy dismissed such calls, writing: ""I am slightly more concerned on my GCSEs at the moment!"" Thanks, Laura!

2017-07-12,Scientists have completed the first teleportation of an object from Earth to a satellite orbiting more than 300 miles away.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/first-ever-earth-orbit-teleportation-completed-10944701,"Alas, those of you expecting Scotty to beam them up soon will be sorely disappointed - the object teleported was merely a single photon. While the experiment doesn't bring us any closer to teleporting matter, it is a huge leap forward for quantum physics. The team of Chinese researchers behind the successful teleportation came together from a number of disciplines and included quantum physicists as well as rocket scientists. In 2016, they launched a satellite called Micius, named after Chinese philosopher from the 5th century BC, from the southwestern Gobi Desert. Micius is equipped with a super sensitive photon receiver which enables it to detect the quantum state of a single photon which is fired at it from the Earth. One of the most difficult to grasp aspects of quantum physics is how observing a quantum particle forces the particle's state to change. This is known as the observer effect, and it is the result of the instruments necessary to measure the state of very small objects. When quantum objects, such as photons, are ""entangled"" it means that they were formed at the same instant in space and so share the same existence. The state of entangled particles are linked, so that if you measure the state of one particle it instantaneously affects the state of the other. Questions arise about how long it takes, if observation of one of the entangled objects can change the state of the other object, for the other object's state to change. Current research describes entangled particles as being part of the same wave function, which means that regardless of the distance between the entangled objects, the quantum state change will take place immediately. This form of immediate change is what is being described when the scientists talk about teleportation. By tangling two photons together and observing one, the scientists are instantaneously transmitting information in a potentially unlimited way. While this has been performed many times in a laboratory setting, the Chinese researcher's experiments show it to be possible to teleport an object from Earth to orbit, and breaks the record for the longest distance for entanglement."
2017-07-12,Britain's competition watchdog is launching a full-scale probe into Tesco's £3.7bn takeover of wholesaler Booker on concerns it could leave some customers worse off.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/tesco-faces-full-scale-probe-into-37bn-booker-takeover-10945367,"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concerns centre on more than 350 local areas where there is an overlap with Booker-supplied franchises such as Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper. It said that in these areas shoppers ""could face worse terms when buying their groceries"". Tesco operates more than 3,000 shops across the UK while wholesaler Booker supplies its services to more than 5,000 so-called ""symbol"" stores under well-known brand names. ""There are concerns that, after the merger, there is potential for Booker to reduce the wholesale services or terms it offers the 'symbol' stores it currently supplies, in order to drive customers to their local Tesco,"" the CMA said. Tesco revealed in January that it had agreed a surprise deal to swallow up the wholesaler - claiming the takeover would ""delight consumers"" and result in ""better availability of quality food at attractive prices"". But the announcement immediately raised questions about the potential effect on competition and the CMA opened a preliminary investigation in May. Tesco last month requested a ""fast-track"" move to the next stage of the probe and the watchdog has now outlined the concerns it has about the deal. The CMA will now carry out an assessment of whether the transaction will reduce competition in an in-depth ""phase 2"" investigation expected to take 24 weeks. It will issue provisional findings before publishing a final report before Christmas. Tesco has been enjoying a recovery under chief executive Dave Lewis and last month reported its best quarterly sales growth since 2010. But this has been achieved partly through battling to keep prices low in the face of inflationary pressures - with the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote meaning more expensive imports. The investment in price has seen Tesco make big cuts elsewhere - announcing a total of more than 2,000 job cuts last month at its head office in Hertfordshire and call centre in Cardiff. Tesco said in a statement: ""We are pleased that the CMA has accepted our fast-track request, and we look forward to continuing our engagement over the coming months. ""This merger has always been about growth, and we remain convinced that it will bring benefits for consumers, independent retailers, caterers, small businesses, suppliers and colleagues."" Tesco did not comment specifically on the concern that shoppers could be worse off in 350 areas."

Other than that we don't have any other information."" He said the details of how and why the cage fell were being investigated by the authorities. Emergency services were called to Newham Leisure Centre at around 5pm on Tuesday after receiving reports that a man had been seriously injured. Hayayei was pronounced dead at the scene. The Met Police said: ""At this early stage it is believed the man was struck by a metal pole which formed part of training facilities at the centre."" Teams and coaches from several nations were present at the time. Sir Philip Craven, president of the International Paralympic Committee, said: ""We are all truly devastated by this tragic news and the passing of Abdullah. ""The thoughts, prayers and condolences of the whole Paralympic Movement are with Abdullah's family, friends and teammates as well as the whole of the National Paralympic Committee of the UAE.

""We will be working closely with all the competitors and teams over the days ahead to offer support wherever it is needed."" Hayayei, from the United Arab Emirates, competed in a number of events including the javelin and shot-put as well as discus.

Conservative MPs had threatened to walk out of the speech if the monarch laid claim to the territory during his speech, but his considered remarks did not see this happen. King Felipe said in the traditional address to both Houses of Parliament that Britain and Spain have a long-shared history and have often ""stood shoulder to shoulder"" as friends, partners and allies in the best interests of both countries. He continued: ""It is just as true, however, that during our rich and fruitful history there have also been estrangements, rivalries and disputes, but the work and determination of our governments, authorities and citizens have relegated such events to the past. ""I am certain that this resolve to overcome our differences will be even greater in the case of Gibraltar and I am confident that through the necessary dialogue and effort, our two governments will be able to work towards arrangements that are acceptable to all involved."" Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, gave the comments a guarded response, telling Sky News: ""What the King has said really harks back to a time when the governments in Madrid and London might make decisions over the heads of the people of Gibraltar."" He said Gibraltar's sovereignty was ""not up for discussion or negotiation"" and the territory ""will never accept giving up one iota of our British sovereignty"". Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell earlier urged Prime Minister Theresa May to remind the King that Gibraltar is British, despite long-standing Spanish claims to the territory. Speaking after the King's address, Mr Rosindell told Sky News it was ""inappropriate"" for him to raise Gibraltar, but the language ""did not justify storming out"". He said: ""It was inappropriate to raise it on a state visit, and while it wasn't that provocative, he misses the point which is that when he talks about arrangements that would be acceptable to all sides, it is only the people of Gibraltar who should be able to make this decision and they have done. ""It wouldn't have justified storming out, although that was what we were talking about if he had gone further."" Flags of the overseas territories and dependencies are regularly raised outside Parliament for state occasions like the King's visit, and Gibraltar's flag is placed in the middle because they are in alphabetical order. King Felipe also addressed Brexit during his speech, which was watched by the PM and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He said any Brexit deal must give the thousands of his compatriots in Britain - and UK expats in Spain - ""sufficient assurance and certainty"" over their futures. He said those citizens have a ""legitimate expectation of decent and stable living conditions"", amid criticism from Brussels of the offer made by Mrs May. King Felipe said Brexit ""saddens"" Spain but that it ""fully respects"" the will of the British people."

2017-07-12,The new leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council has admitted she had never been inside one of her high-rise flats before the Grenfell tragedy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/new-grenfell-council-leader-admits-she-had-never-been-in-a-high-rise-flat-before-disaster-10945923,"Elizabeth Campbell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I haven't been into the high-rise council blocks before, but I am certainly doing that now."" She later clarified to Sky News presenter Adam Boulton that she had visited tower blocks while out canvassing, but had never been inside any of the flats. ""I thought people had actually asked me whether I had been into people's flats - I've been into other flats in lots of other things,"" she said. :: Family names daughter as latest victim Ms Campbell was elected onto Kensington and Chelsea Council 11 years ago. She said she had spent the last seven years running family and children services, and ""dealing with the most disadvantaged children and families in our society in the UK"". ""Whether I have been on the 21st floor of a particular tower block I don't think is relevant,"" she said. ""I have met families in a whole range of social rented accommodation - absolutely, of course I have."" Asked if she thought it mattered to residents if she had been inside a council tower block, she said it did matter, because ""people want a leader who understands absolutely, exactly"". She went on: ""Do I think it matters on another level? No, because I have got the experience and understanding."" Ms Campbell rejected claims that the community was divided between the wealthy and poor - but admitted it would take a generation for the council to regain the trust of local people. ""I don't think there is a divide between the communities,"" she said. ""What I do think is there is a divide between the united community of rich and poor, and the state - and that trust in the state, whether it be central government or local government, has broken down. I think it might take a generation to repair that."" Responding to claims of social cleansing in the area over which Grenfell Tower looms, she said: ""The residents of Lancaster West can stay in Lancaster West - I guarantee it will be all social housing."" Grenfell Tower's 24 floors have been left ravaged by the fire on 14 June. At least 80 people are thought to have died in the blaze, but that number could rise. An inquiry has been ordered by Prime Minister Theresa May into the tragedy which is being chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick. Ms Campbell said: ""There's a web of different things he needs to unravel. ""I understand from our legal people that we have saved absolutely everything on servers - everything is there. ""We will be open and transparent. Any documents they need we will produce."" The Prime Minister's official spokesman confirmed Mrs May had been inside a high-rise building. Asked if Ms Campbell's confession raised questions over her fitness to lead the council, he said: ""Our position is that having a new leader in Kensington and Chelsea provides an opportunity for change."""
2017-07-12,An investigation into the abuse of candidates is being launched following a wave of intimidation during the General Election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/inquiry-launched-into-horrifying-abuse-of-election-candidates-10946090,"Labour and the Conservatives have both accused the other of failing to act to stamp out abuse by members and activists in the wake of reports of racism, anti-Semitism and sexism on the campaign trail. Prime Minister Theresa May has asked the Committee on Standards in Public Life to carry out a review into the problem, as MPs gathered in Westminster Hall to discuss the apparent rise in personal attacks. The investigation will look at the current protections that are in place and produce recommendations on the best ways to tackle abuse in the future. Mrs May said: ""I have been horrified by stories from colleagues about the scale and nature of the intimidation, bullying and harassment they suffered during the General Election campaign. ""Robust debate is a vital part of our democracy, but there can be no place for the shocking threats and abuse we have seen in recent months. ""We must all work together to banish this behaviour, and I would urge MPs and candidates from all parties to report their experiences to this review so we get the fullest possible picture - and can take the action required to stamp it out."" The move comes after a cross-party group said political parties must do more to prepare candidates for the ruthless nature of campaigning. It highlighted a number of cases of abuse during the 2017 campaign, including reports by Conservative former minister Andrew Percy, a convert to Judaism, that he had been called ""Zionist scum"". Tory Sheryll Murray said she was left ""sickened"" when her posters were daubed with swastikas, while Ameet Jogia, a British Asian Conservative candidate who stood against Labour MP Barry Gardiner in Brent North, reported discovering a voting booth vandalised with graffiti, stating: ""Vote Labour Barry, not Jogia. Keep p**** out of politics"". Labour has accused the Tories of carrying out vitriolic personal attacks on election candidates on an industrial scale during the campaign. The party claimed the Conservatives ran a nasty campaign full of smears and untruths about opponents, particularly shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Millions of pounds were spent on attack adverts on social media in a campaign that could deter future parliamentary hopefuls from entering politics, the party said. Conservative MP Simon Hart said Labour was also guilty of abuse, and wants tougher action from Jeremy Corbyn to stamp out bullying by his activists. ""Rather than just putting out feeble messages online saying you condemn all this, Jeremy Corbyn needs to actually do something about it,"" Mr Hart told the Daily Mail."
2017-07-12,"EU negotiator Michel Barnier has reminded the UK that the Brexit ""clock is ticking"" - after Boris Johnson said the EU should ""go whistle"" over the EU exit bill.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/michel-barniers-jab-at-boris-johnsons-go-whistle-remark-10945670,"""I am not hearing any whistling, just a clock ticking,"" Mr Barnier said. On Tuesday Mr Johnson was asked in the Commons whether Brussels should be told to ""go whistle"" if it asks for a hefty sum from Britain in the form of a so-called exit bill for leaving the European Union. The Foreign Secretary said: ""I think that the sums that I have seen ... seem to me to be extortionate and I think go whistle is an entirely appropriate expression."" Speaking in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Barnier said the EU was not seeking a ""punishment"" or ""revenge"" in Brexit negotiations. He instead described the financial settlement as a ""settling of accounts"". ""We are not asking the UK for a single euro or a single pound more than they have legally undertaken to provide,"" he said. Although an official figure has not yet been put forward, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested the cost to the UK of a financial settlement could be around €60bn. The figure is based on obligations for programmes the UK agreed to support as a EU member, as well as ongoing costs like staff pensions. Mr Barnier said that honouring these costs was a matter of ""trust"". Tough conditions set by negotiators have been criticised by British politicians, including Nigel Farage who called costs a ""ransom"". The question of the UK's financial obligations is one of three areas that Mr Barnier said must progress before negotiations on trade can take place. The rights of EU citizens living in the UK and arrangements around Irish borders are the other ""priority subjects"". The European Parliament has slammed Theresa May's proposals on protecting citizens' rights, telling Mr Barnier that they relegate EU nationals to ""second-class status"" in the UK. Ms May suggested in June that EU nationals who have lived in the UK for five years would be offered ""settled status"" in the country. In his comments on Wednesday Mr Barnier said the British proposal would not enable EU citizens ""to continue to live their lives as they do today"". He said he did not know whether the final trade agreement with the UK would be free and fair, but said the decision to leave the EU had ""many consequences"". ""The best possible relationship with the EU would be to remain a member of the EU,"" he said."
2017-07-12,Donald Trump Jr was an unwavering champion of his father throughout the 2016 campaign.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/trump-jr-claims-a-gear-change-in-russia-scandal-10945302,"Just before the New York Times was about to publish an email chain about meeting a Russian lawyer, in a bombshell move, Mr Trump Jr got ahead of the game and tweeted it himself. The content left little doubt over the meeting's pretext. The emails show that he was told the meeting would provide dirt on Hillary Clinton that could help his father's campaign. The exchange was also very explicit about the Russian government's ""support for Mr Trump"", a notion which raised no questions or surprise from Mr Trump Jr. Prior to this we've heard about undisclosed meetings between members of Mr Trump's team and Russian officials but there's been very little about the content. This is the first time we've learnt that Mr Trump's team were aware of Russia's intention to meddle to the detriment of Mrs Clinton. It's also the first clear sign that Mr Trump's team was willing to help them in that aim. ""Collusion"" has become a buzz word in Washington as numerous investigations try to get to the bottom of whether Mr Trump's team worked with the Kremlin in its 2016 interference. The Trump administration has repeatedly denied the idea which Mr Trump calls a witch-hunt. The Russian lawyer involved said she has no Kremlin links nor did she have any damaging information on Mrs Clinton. But the email exchange describes her as a ""Russian government attorney"" - when agreeing to the meeting that's who Mr Trump Jr thought he would be getting information from. This is without question a gear change in the whole Russia story. The White House is seemingly struggling to find the right response. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr Trump praised his son's transparent handling of the issue before refusing to answer any questions about it. Mr Trump Jr's defence is that this was just good old fashioned political dirt digging. But this went beyond Washington - beyond the United States - and into the realms of a foreign adversary. While collusion itself is not a crime, intent to solicit a contribution from a foreign national is. Victoria Nourse, former White House counsel to the vice president Joe Biden said: ""This email, as far as I can say, is good evidence of intent to solicit a contribution from a foreign national. ""At the very least, it shows knowledge that the individual was foreign, which should have set off alarm bells. ""Whatever Mr Trump may have thought was going on, whenever anyone in a campaign is dealing with a foreign national, and it involves anything of value, information or money, that's when you go 1-800-FBI."" The White House says President Trump wants to move on and focus on the business of governing but the list of undisclosed Russia meetings is growing - suspicion is reaching new heights."
2017-07-12,"Islamist extremist organisations are receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds a year - mainly from small, anonymous public donations from UK-based individuals, a Government report has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/islamist-extremist-groups-getting-funds-from-uk-donors-10945926,"Home Secretary Amber Rudd has decided against publishing the long-awaited document in full because of national security concerns and the volume of personal information it contains. Opposition parties hit out at this decision, with Labour claiming the report was suppressed to protect Britain's relationship with Saudi Arabia. Ms Rudd said the ""most common source of support for Islamist extremist organisations in the UK is from small, anonymous public donations, with the majority of these donations most likely coming from UK-based individuals"". ""In some cases these organisations receive hundreds of thousands of pounds a year,"" she added. ""This is the main source of their income."" Ms Rudd said the donors may not know or support the organisations' full agenda. The report was commissioned by then prime minister David Cameron in November 2015. The Home Office review into the nature, scale and origin of the funding of Islamist extremist activity in the UK also examined overseas sources. For a small number of organisations with which there are extremism concerns, overseas funding is a ""significant source of income"", the report found. But for the vast majority of extremist groups in Britain, overseas funding is not so important, according to the review. Ms Rudd said the report ""gives us the best picture we have ever had of how extremists operating in the UK sustain their activities"". The review also says that some Islamic organisations of concern are posing as charities to increase their credibility and to take advantage of Islam's emphasis on charity. Some of these are deliberately vague about their activities and their charitable status, according to the review. Support from abroad has allowed individuals to study at institutions that teach ""deeply conservative forms of Islam"", the report found. Such support also provides ""highly socially conservative literature and preachers"" to the UK institutions and some of these individuals have since become of extremist concern. Ms Rudd said the Government would be directly raising issues of concern with ""specific countries as part of our wider international engagement on countering extremism and violent extremism"". The Home Secretary said no single measure would tackle all the issues raised in the report, but rather a comprehensive approach focused particularly on domestic sources of support for all forms of extremism was needed. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there was a ""strong suspicion"" the report was being ""suppressed to protect this Government's trade and diplomatic priorities, including in relation to Saudi Arabia"". Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas attacked the review for not giving details of which countries the funding comes from. Outgoing Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron also said further detail was needed. ""Instead of supporting the perpetrators of these vile ideologies, the Government should be naming and shaming them - including so-called allies like Saudi Arabia and Qatar if need be,"" he said."

Of those, 29,302 reported physical or verbal bullying only. And 3,655 teenagers (3%) said they had been bullied both face-to-face and online. But just 406 of the teenagers (less than 1%) said they had been bullied only in cyberspace. Researchers from the Oxford Internet Institute said: ""Traditional bullying is considerably more common among adolescents in England than cyberbullying."" They said their findings did not square with ""media reports and the popular perceptions that young people are now more likely to be victims of cyberbullying than traditional forms"". In 2014, Sky News reported how police were dealing with thousands of children for breaking laws used to crack down on those abusing others online. Earlier this year, the anti-bullying charity Ditch the Label reported it found more than half of children had been bullied while playing games online. A poll commissioned by the charity Action for Children found as many as one in seven children were bullying others online. The researchers' findings also come in stark contrast to a report by the NSPCC on bullying in 2015/16, which noted that calls to Childline about cyberbullying have increased 88% over the last five years. The NSPCC says that according to the counselling sessions held with young people, cyberbullying is now almost as prevalent as physical bullying. Claire Lilley, NSPCC's head of Child Safety Online, said: ""We know that cyberbullying can be particularly damaging because it doesn't stop at the school gates. Bullying can be devastating for young people no matter what form it takes. ""Every year we receive more and more calls about cyberbullying. It's vital that children who are being bullied tell someone what's going on, either by talking to a trusted adult or by contacting Childline on 0800 11 11."""
2017-07-12,Ariana Grande has become Manchester's first honorary citizen in light of her response to the terror attack at her gig in the city.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/ariana-grande-becomes-manchesters-first-honorary-citizen-10945510,"Councillors unanimously accepted a proposal for the star to be the first recipient in a new system recognising people who have made an outstanding contribution to the city without living in it. Following the suicide bomb attack at her show at Manchester Arena in May, the 23-year-old singer organised the One Love Manchester concert just two weeks later, with numerous other stars, including Katy Perry, Justin Bieber and Coldplay, and Manchester's own Liam Gallagher, taking to the stage in tribute to the victims. The concert has so far raised almost £3 million for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese said Grande had ""exemplified"" the ""resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May - with love and courage rather than hatred and fear"". The suggested proposal was discussed in detail at a council meeting on Wednesday, attended by family members of some of the victims. ""Manchester continues to move forwards with strength, spirit and its trademark swagger. But we will never forget the terrible events of 22 May and their aftermath,"" said Sir Richard. ""As well as honouring the victims and all those affected, it is important that we remember the extraordinary acts of courage and generosity of spirit which we have witnessed. ""The worst of times have in many ways brought out the best in the city."" Following the terror attack, it would have been understandable if Grande ""never wanted to see this place again"", Sir Richard said. Instead, she returned to visit survivors in hospital and to put on the One Love gig, bringing ""comfort to thousands"". ""Many people would already consider her an honorary Mancunian,"" the council leader said. The meeting also heard from several people involved in the response to the attack. Lorraine Hulme, a ward sister at Wythenshawe Hospital who was on duty on the night of the tragedy, said: ""I feel extremely proud to be part of such an outstanding team and I know the same can be said for all hospitals and their staff involved across the region."""
2017-07-12,Giving people more freedom over how they spend their retirement savings was one of the boldest things George Osborne did as Chancellor.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/why-there-are-concerns-over-george-osbornes-pension-freedom-reforms-10945796,"However, two years on from Mr Osborne's pension reforms, the UK's main financial regulator has flagged its concerns about the new arrangements. Publishing the first major comprehensive study into the impact of the reforms on the retirement income market, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warns consumers are not shopping around sufficiently and are not taking enough advice when accessing their pension pots. :: Drawing down pensions early is 'the new norm' It also warns that some may be paying too much tax as a result of their decisions. It may now have to step in to help save consumers from themselves. Before Mr Osborne's reforms, most people retiring with a so-called ""defined contribution"" or ""money purchase"" pension were obliged to turn their pension pot into an annuity, a product guaranteeing them a fixed income in retirement. These had become unpopular in recent years because the income they guaranteed had plummeted as a result of ultra-low interest rates. The former chancellor's solution was to remove the obligation to buy an annuity. Instead, anyone over the age of 55 was allowed to access their pension pot and spend the money as they saw fit. The FCA's report confirms this has been popular. The watchdog notes more than one million pension pots have been accessed by savers since the reforms were introduced in 2015, with more than half of the pension pots emptied entirely. That, says the FCA, is because many people mistrust pensions. It also reflects that, in a lot of cases, these people did not have much money saved. In nine out of 10 such cases, the pension pots being emptied contained less than £30,000 worth of savings and, in six out of 10 cases, less than £10,000. Crucially, the FCA says this is not necessarily proof of people ""squandering"" their savings, as most savers making full withdrawals had other sources of retirement income and because, in more than half of all cases where pension pots were completely emptied, the money was being saved or invested elsewhere. But there are causes for concern. The biggest flagged by the FCA is that many people who take no advice regard money accessed from their pension pots as a ""windfall"". This is shockingly ignorant and may store up problems for the future. Secondly, those buying ""drawdown"" products, where savers gradually draw money from their pension pot but stay invested in the stock market, are following what the FCA calls the ""path of least resistance"" and are simply buying from their existing pension provider. This potentially exposes hundreds of thousands of people to the risk of missing out on better value elsewhere. Worse still, with many people now shunning annuities altogether, fewer and fewer insurers are selling them. According to the FCA, there are presently just seven companies now selling annuities on the open market. That is inevitably going to result in a lack of competition and poor consumer choice. No wonder Tom McPhail, head of policy at the financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown and one of the industry's deeper thinkers on pensions, has called the report ""a regulatory cry for help"" and a sign that the FCA ""seems to be trying to put the pension freedom genie back in the bottle"". Mr Osborne's pension freedoms were supposed to offer consumers more choice with what they do with their money. Ironically, it seems to be leading to less choice in some cases. They were supposed to be a recognition that a lot of people could be trusted with their own money. Unfortunately, because saving for retirement is a complex business, there are signs they may not be after all - putting many at risk of financial insecurity in their old age. Perhaps the most damning assessment from the FCA is its warning that too many people may be paying too much tax after accessing their pension pot. When the new freedoms were unveiled, it was not pointed out often enough that those people cashing in their pension pot may only take out a quarter of the money on a tax free basis. To that end, ""pension freedoms"" looked like a cynical move by the former Chancellor to extract tax on a stealthy basis, dressed up as a consumer-friendly measure. The report by the FCA does nothing to remove that suspicion."
2017-07-12,Andy Murray has been knocked out of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage after he was beaten in five sets by Sam Querrey.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/andy-murray-beaten-in-wimbledon-quarter-final-10946071,"The 30-year-old world number one had led by two sets to one, but was clearly suffering from an injury in the fourth set as his American opponent levelled the match. Querrey, the 24th seed, broke early in the fifth set and there was no way back for the defending champion who went on to lose 3-6 6-4 6-7 6-1 6-1. Murray had been struggling with a hip injury before the Wimbledon championships, and had to cancel two exhibition matches as he tried to recover from the problem. He downplayed the injury after declaring himself fit for the tournament, but was visibly limping in his quarter-final and struggled to stay in the match in the final two sets. Speaking after the match, he said: ""The whole tournament I've been a little bit sore. But I tried my best right to the end, gave everything I had. I'm proud of that. ""But it's obviously disappointing to lose at Wimbledon. There's obviously an opportunity there, so I'm sad that it's over."" He added that he was not ""a million miles away from winning the match"". The defeat is Murray's worst at Wimbledon in terms of his opponent's ranking. He had previously never lost to a player ranked lower than the then world number 19 David Nalbandian, at his debut at the tournament in 2005. Querrey is the first American man to reach the semi-finals at a major tournament since Andy Roddick was Wimbledon runner-up in 2009. He will next face either Gilles Muller or Marin Cilic on Friday in his first Grand Slam semi. After the match, he said: ""I didn't start the best but I just kept swinging away and found my groove in the last two sets. ""It feels great. It's a dream come true to be in the semi-final at Wimbledon, it's very special."" Three-time champion Novak Djokovic also exited the championships after he retired through injury during his quarter final match against Thomas Berdych. Home nation hopes will now rest with Johanna Konta, who on Tuesday became the first British woman to make the semi-finals at Wimbledon since Virginia Wade in 1978. Murray backed his fellow British tennis player to win, saying she played ""extremely well under a lot of pressure"". He said: ""You know, I hope she goes on to win the tournament. She's certainly got a fantastic chance."""

Half of the survey respondents were simply asked whether they supported ending austerity - 56% said they did, with 30% opposed. Some 6% answered neither, with 7% saying they did not know. The results were effectively identical among the other half of respondents, who were asked about their views on ending austerity specifically if it meant they personally had to pay more in taxes. Again, 56% supported ending austerity under such a scenario, with 31% opposed. Londoners are the most likely to support an end to austerity, with 65% in support even if it meant higher taxes for them personally. Older voters were less enthusiastic than young people about ending austerity, but there was still a majority in favour of higher Government spending among every age group. It comes as the Government faces increasing pressure from both opposing parties and their own MPs to end austerity, with several high profile figures calling for an end to the 1% cap on rises to public sector pay. The review body in charge of teachers' pay has warned that continuing the cap poses a ""real risk"" to schools' ability to recruit and retain quality teachers. Meanwhile, the National Union of Teachers says teachers' pay has fallen by 13% in real terms since 2010.

2017-07-12,There's no doubt Theresa May is still fighting for her political life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/five-ways-jeremy-corbyn-could-take-power-10944658,"The Prime Minister is battling on a number of fronts, with some saying her leadership and credibility are in tatters. Her Conservative minority government - propped up by the DUP - is in a fragile position and faces many challenges in Parliament - not least on Britain's exit from the European Union. But has her election disaster left the door open for Jeremy Corbyn to enter Number 10? We take a look at several scenarios which could precipitate another general election in which the Labour leader could take power. :: Losing a key vote Mrs May's gamble of a snap election to win a Brexit mandate horribly backfired, leaving her with a working majority of just 13 - 10 of those votes reliant on the Democratic Unionist Party's lawmakers. It only takes seven Conservative MPs to turn a rebellion into a loss of majority for the Government and the DUP - or even a small number of absences through illness or travel delays. This would also require a considerable amount of planning on the part of the opposition parties to organise a potential defeat of a key legislative Bill by ganging up on the Tories and DUP - but it is plausible. Key manifesto pledges to change the triple lock on pensions, to means-test the winter fuel allowance and bring back fox hunting and grammar schools have already been sacrificed to see off such a threat. Labour has claimed Mrs May's programme is in ""tatters"". ""Theresa May does not have a mandate for continued cuts to our schools, hospitals, police and other vital public services or for a race-to-the-bottom Brexit,"" Mr Corbyn was warned. ""Labour will fight these policies every step of the way."" :: Vote of no confidence The Conservative Party is ruthless with losers - and the PM's benches will be watching her performance closely following her botched election campaign. While some Tories have called for calm, warning the party needs another leadership election ""like a hole in the head"", rivals may wait for Mrs May's not so strong and stable leadership to fail. Only 15% of Tory MPs would need to back a no confidence vote in the Prime Minister to trigger a leadership contest - this means just 48 members of her minority government turning against her. Even if this were to happen, it does not mean an immediate election. The nation did not go to the polls when Mrs May replaced David Cameron last year. In addition, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act remains in place - which means a two-thirds vote of the House of Commons is required to secure an early dissolution - so both main parties need to be on side for it to happen. In other words, a majority of MPs must pass a motion saying ""this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government"". Given Labour's recent surge in the polls and Mr Corbyn's rising popularity making him the favourite to win, why would the Conservatives - or a new Tory PM - want another election anytime in the near future? All parties would have two weeks to form another government. If that failed, another election would be called. In any case, Mrs May's downfall, however, would set off a chain of events making another election inevitable. :: Could Brexit trigger an early election? Well, it triggered the June poll! Mrs May's catastrophic gamble to win a Brexit mandate has left her party split over the issue. While the Cabinet Brexiteers have been boosted by the return of Michael Gove, Tory Remainers have been flexing their muscles since the election result and there are growing doubts whether her version of a ""hard"" Brexit will happen at all. She is facing a wider bid to water down her Brexit plans by a cross-party group set up to fight against a ""hard"" Brexit. The all-party parliamentary group on EU relations is co-chaired by Chuka Umunna, who recently led a Labour revolt over Brexit by calling for the UK to stay in the single market, and prominent Remain campaigner and Conservative MP Anna Soubry. The Repeal Bill - which will replicate all existing EU law into British law by the time of Britain's departure from the EU - is expected to be tabled when Parliament returns in the autumn and will provide a crucial test for the Government's ability to get key measures through. In addition, she is also facing pressure over her plan to quit Europe's nuclear regulator Euratom because it is under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - whose influence over the UK she has highlighted as a ""red line"" in her Brexit negotiations. At least nine Tory MPs have indicated they are against this, and according to Sky's Political Editor Faisal Islam, on this issue, at least, the implications appear toxic for the Prime Minister's chance of a majority. Mr Corbyn is facing splits in his own party over Brexit as well - highlighted earlier this month when 49 Labour MPs defied him and party policy by voting in favour of an amendment tabled by Mr Umunna calling for Britain to remain in the single market. But it is Mrs May who is in the driving seat (at least for now) and in her own words, facing ""a different reality"" a year on since becoming Tory leader, and her plea to Mr Corbyn and Labour to come to her aid on Brexit has fallen on deaf ears. Mr Corbyn has rejected and mocked her appeal for cross-party cooperation on government policy making, and instead demanded a fresh election if her government has run out of ideas. :: The Democratic Unionist Party walks away The confidence and supply deal worth £1.5bn agreed with the Conservatives means the DUP's 10 MPs will support the Government on key votes in the Commons - including the event of a no confidence vote. The pact prevents Mrs May's minority government from being ""ambushed"" - as described by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The deal is not binding - unlike the formal 2010 coalition between the Tories and Liberal Democrats. However, it is in the interests of the Northern Irish parliamentary kingmakers to keep their part of the deal and prop up Mrs May's premiership. Under the arrangement, about £1bn in ""new money"" has been earmarked for Northern Ireland, as well as greater flexibility over £500m already allocated to the country. Mrs May has survived several crucial Commons tests already - including a majority vote for her Queen's Speech - thanks to the DUP's support. The DUP has also reportedly pledged to support Mrs May's government ""for as long as Jeremy Corbyn is leader of the Labour Party"". The likelihood of Mr Corbyn being ousted on the back of a significant post-election boost for Labour is slim. :: Another General Election The most likely way Mr Corbyn could enter Number 10 is if there was a fresh election. Just hours after the June poll results were declared, Mr Corbyn called on Mrs May to resign, declaring he was ""ready to serve the country"". It is impossible to say how long the PM will last at Number 10. Minority administrations have an unhappy history and Mrs May will be wary of the fate that has befallen others before her, including the cricket-loving former PM John Major who also relied on the support of Ulster Unionist Party MPs. In 1992, Mr Major won a majority of 21, but found himself leading a minority government from December 1996 due to a combination of by-election losses and defections. His minority government limped on until May 1997 when the Conservatives were swept away in a landslide by Tony Blair's Labour, sealing Mr Major's fate. Mrs May said at almost every election campaign rally that if she lost just six seats she would have lost the election. In the end her party recorded a net loss of 13 seats. Mr Corbyn's Labour surged to 261 seats - up 29 from its tally in the 2015 election. She is still in Downing Street, but her minority government does not wield much power. If key legislation is repeatedly voted down in Parliament, the country could be going to the polls again very soon, with Mr Corbyn odds-on favourite to become the next PM."
2017-07-12,Coca-Cola has pledged that all its UK bottles will be made from 50% recycled plastic by 2020.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170712164920/http://news.sky.com/story/coca-cola-bottles-to-be-made-from-50-recycled-plastic-by-2020-10946089,"The soft drinks giant will also trial a ""recovery and reward"" scheme in the UK, which it says will inform national projects that encourage recycling. Similar deposit return programmes have been highlighted by Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign. They are usually based on consumers paying a small amount extra for their bottled drink, which is refunded if they return the packaging. A Greenpeace report revealed in 2016 that Coca-Cola had fiercely opposed such schemes and had resolved a ""fight back"" against them. But the brand made a u-turn on its position earlier this year, announcing it supported the introduction of a deposit return scheme in Scotland. This week's announcement on recycling means Coca-Cola will double the percentage of recycled plastic in its bottles. Coca Cola's general manager, Jon Woods, told Sky News: ""I want all of our plastic packaging back because I don't want to see it lying at the side of a road or on a beach anymore than anybody else."" He admitted there was ""more we could do"" to tackle the problem, but added: ""I'm entirely open to a deposit return scheme if it's well managed and it's sufficiently run... ""The only time plastic becomes a problem is if its not recycled - if it's thrown away. So I think the best way forward for us is to drive up the recycling rates."" But Greenpeace has called the move a ""PR spin"" that does not go far enough. Ocean plastic campaigner Louise Edge urged the brand to push for an industry-wide deposit return scheme and to get more reusable bottles on the shelves. ""They're doing nothing to genuinely challenge the culture of throwaway single use plastic bottles,"" she said. A recent Greenpeace study released earlier this year estimated that Coca-Cola produced 100 billion single use bottles every year. The environmental group has targeted Coca-Cola for its use of plastic packaging. ""This company has a history of making green announcements that sound good but deliver little,"" Ms Edge said. Coca-Cola also announced it would run a marketing campaign to promote recycling and that it hoped a new advertisement featuring ""love-struck plastic bottles"" would reach 35 million people in the UK. The changes will mean UK bottles for all 20 of the company's brands - including Sprite, Fanta and Schweppes - will have 50% recycled plastic by 2020. It will meet its aim through a partnership with bottle reprocessing facility Clean Tech and will source all its recycled plastic from the UK."

2017-07-14,There's no doubt Theresa May is still fighting for her political life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170715004133/http://news.sky.com/story/five-ways-jeremy-corbyn-could-take-power-10944658,"The Prime Minister is battling on a number of fronts, with some saying her leadership and credibility are in tatters. Her Conservative minority government - propped up by the DUP - is in a fragile position and faces many challenges in Parliament - not least on Britain's exit from the European Union. But has her election disaster left the door open for Jeremy Corbyn to enter Number 10? We take a look at several scenarios which could precipitate another general election in which the Labour leader could take power. :: Losing a key vote Mrs May's gamble of a snap election to win a Brexit mandate horribly backfired, leaving her with a working majority of just 13 - 10 of those votes reliant on the Democratic Unionist Party's lawmakers. It only takes seven Conservative MPs to turn a rebellion into a loss of majority for the Government and the DUP - or even a small number of absences through illness or travel delays. This would also require a considerable amount of planning on the part of the opposition parties to organise a potential defeat of a key legislative Bill by ganging up on the Tories and DUP - but it is plausible. Key manifesto pledges to change the triple lock on pensions, to means-test the winter fuel allowance and bring back fox hunting and grammar schools have already been sacrificed to see off such a threat. Labour has claimed Mrs May's programme is in ""tatters"". ""Theresa May does not have a mandate for continued cuts to our schools, hospitals, police and other vital public services or for a race-to-the-bottom Brexit,"" Mr Corbyn was warned. ""Labour will fight these policies every step of the way."" :: Vote of no confidence The Conservative Party is ruthless with losers - and the PM's benches will be watching her performance closely following her botched election campaign. While some Tories have called for calm, warning the party needs another leadership election ""like a hole in the head"", rivals may wait for Mrs May's not so strong and stable leadership to fail. Only 15% of Tory MPs would need to back a no confidence vote in the Prime Minister to trigger a leadership contest - this means just 48 members of her minority government turning against her. Even if this were to happen, it does not mean an immediate election. The nation did not go to the polls when Mrs May replaced David Cameron last year. In addition, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act remains in place - which means a two-thirds vote of the House of Commons is required to secure an early dissolution - so both main parties need to be on side for it to happen. In other words, a majority of MPs must pass a motion saying ""this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government"". Given Labour's recent surge in the polls and Mr Corbyn's rising popularity making him the favourite to win, why would the Conservatives - or a new Tory PM - want another election anytime in the near future? All parties would have two weeks to form another government. If that failed, another election would be called. In any case, Mrs May's downfall, however, would set off a chain of events making another election inevitable. :: Could Brexit trigger an early election? Well, it triggered the June poll! Mrs May's catastrophic gamble to win a Brexit mandate has left her party split over the issue. While the Cabinet Brexiteers have been boosted by the return of Michael Gove, Tory Remainers have been flexing their muscles since the election result and there are growing doubts whether her version of a ""hard"" Brexit will happen at all. She is facing a wider bid to water down her Brexit plans by a cross-party group set up to fight against a ""hard"" Brexit. The all-party parliamentary group on EU relations is co-chaired by Chuka Umunna, who recently led a Labour revolt over Brexit by calling for the UK to stay in the single market, and prominent Remain campaigner and Conservative MP Anna Soubry. The Repeal Bill - which will replicate all existing EU law into British law by the time of Britain's departure from the EU - is expected to be tabled when Parliament returns in the autumn and will provide a crucial test for the Government's ability to get key measures through. In addition, she is also facing pressure over her plan to quit Europe's nuclear regulator Euratom because it is under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - whose influence over the UK she has highlighted as a ""red line"" in her Brexit negotiations.

The remarks provoked calls for him to be sacked, but a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will not be removing Lord Adonis from his post. And the Labour peer has told Sky News he stands by the comments and does not regret making them. In the interview he said the UK is in ""serious danger"" of getting Brexit wrong and warned the country faces a steep decline in living standards compared with France and Germany unless the country can ""have our cake and eat it"". Lord Adonis told the House magazine: ""My language is usually pretty subdued in politics. ""But anyone with a historical sense - and I'm a historian - recognises that leaving the economic institutions of the European Union, which have guided our destiny as a trading nation for half a century, is a very big step and the importance can't be overemphasised. ""To my mind, it's as big a step that we're taking as a country as decolonisation in the 1950s and 60s and appeasement in the 1930s. ""We got it right on decolonisation; we got it wrong on appeasement and I think we're in serious danger of getting it wrong in the way that we leave the EU. ""If we can't have our cake and eat it then we face a serious relative decline in our living standards compared with France and Germany and I don't believe the British people will put up with that."" Lord Adonis' comments have sparked calls from Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs for him to be sacked. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: ""I am astonished and appalled that someone who considers himself to be intelligent should have selected such a comparison given all the appalling violence and death that Hitler visited on Europe and the rest of the world. ""I find his comments deeply offensive, as I believe most of the British people will too."" Another Tory MP, Peter Bone, told the newspaper: ""He should be fired."" Backbencher Andrew Bridgen said: ""Of course he should be removed from any advisory role to government. He doesn't really believe in democracy - just like Hitler."" But a Government spokeswoman has said Mrs May will not sack Lord Adonis. She said: ""He is not a member of the Government. He is not a Conservative peer. His job is to provide independent advice to Government on infrastructure, that doesn't have anything to do with the views he expressed on Brexit. ""She completely disagrees with those views. ""His views on Brexit have no bearing on the position that he holds. It is down to him to explain his views."""

Ms Piper, 33, described how survivors of acid attacks are handed a ""life sentence"" through the trauma of their ordeal. She published her plea for increased legislation in the wake of five acid attacks, believed to be linked, which took place within 90 minutes of each other in north and east London on Thursday night. It comes just a few weeks after aspiring model Resham Khan and her cousin Jameel Muhktar in east London were attacked while celebrating her 21st birthday. There was another acid attack in east London on Easter Monday, leaving two people at a nightclub partially blinded and others injured. The UK has one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world, with the crimes feared to be on the rise. :: Acid attacks: Calls to restrict sales Ms Piper was left partially blind and with severe, permanent scarring when a former boyfriend arranged for acid to be thrown in her face in 2008. Writing in the Scars, Burns and Healing journal, Ms Piper described how she has undergone 250 operations and hours of psychological therapy following the assault, which left her contemplating suicide. She wrote: ""I will continue to need operations and therapy for life. For acid attack survivors, the aftermath is a life sentence."" Urging the Government to impose harsher penalties on attackers who use corrosive substances, Ms Piper said: ""Lives can be destroyed in moments. ""Survivors of such attacks often have to live with the immediate fear that their attackers may still be at large, and in the longer term - even if the attackers are caught and sentenced - may be released to potentially live alongside them after serving a minimum term. ""I meet many inspiring individuals who have worked hard to rebuild their lives after an attack; however, it can be hard to stay motivated when the justice system does not always reflect the severity of these crimes."" Ms Piper, who has set up a charity to help adults who suffer burns from any cause, said current UK law and sentencing does not reflect the severity of acid attacks. She claimed is is ""all too easy for someone to buy a corrosive substance and throw it... at another person"". Calling on authorities to ""prevent more lives being destroyed"", Ms Piper said: ""Tougher sentencing would surely act as a deterrent to further attacks. ""The issue of penalties for carrying corrosive substances needs to be addressed and restrictions on the sale of corrosive substances need to be looked at seriously."""

Officials said the assailant, who has been arrested, swam to the beach before attacking the tourists. The motive for the attack is not yet known. The tourists who died were Ukrainian, the interior ministry said. It said the injured tourists were rushed to a local hospital but gave no further details and did not provide their nationalities. Hurghada is one of Egypt's most popular beach resorts, particularly with Ukrainians and other European tourists. Security has been tightened in tourist resorts around the country as the industry is a major revenue stream for Egypt. The attack came after five police officers were shot dead in Cairo's twin city of Giza when suspected Islamic militants opened fire on their vehicle early on Friday morning. In January 2016, three tourists in Hurghada were wounded in a stabbing attack by two assailants with apparent Islamic State group sympathies."

Terrorists have shown recently that you don't need to build bombs, or buy automatic weapons to kill and maim. You can create carnage by driving a stolen or hired vehicle into crowds. So, too, ordinary criminals, who need to do nothing more complicated than pop into a corner shop or DIY store or empty a car battery to get their hands on a ready-made weapon that will cause real harm. Acid attacks have been used for personal revenge, particularly against women in the Muslim community, where victims will carry their disfigurement as a constant reminder to themselves and others. For years in Britain it was a regular tactic of armed robbers who would squirt, or threaten to squirt, ammonia from a squeezey bottle into the faces of terrified guards. But corrosive fluid of one sort or another has also been used in murders, rapes and gang attacks. :: Acid attacks: Calls to restrict sales after victims burned and disfigured And it's on the increase: last year the number of reported acid attacks in London increased by 74% to 458. Since 2010 there have been 1,800. There was a similar rise in the West Midlands and a national increase of 30%. A teenager told the Sun newspaper this year: ""It's easy to buy and will mess someone up good. I feel safer carrying it to school. ""For a fiver you get drain cleaner, or you can buy ammonia for £3 and keep it in a drinks bottle."" :: Teenager arrested after five moped acid attacks in London in 90 minutes Campaigners have called for such household products to be made weaker or thicker to prevent criminal use. And they recommend that all purchasers should have to register their personal details. None of that will come in time to bring a sudden halt to the current growing trend of acid attacks which, until around 10 years ago, were rare crimes in the UK."

One teenager has been arrested and one victim is described as having ""life-changing"" injuries. It comes a few weeks after another horrific attack on an aspiring model celebrating her 21st birthday and her 27-year-old cousin. Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar were left with devastating injuries after acid was thrown through their car window in Beckton, east London on 21 June. Mr Muhktar - who was in a coma for two days - said his t-shirt and shorts were ""falling apart"" and his trainers ""melting on his feet"" after the attack. He told Channel 4 News he and his cousin were screaming in pain and he stripped naked to try to stop the burning. ""They're throwing buckets of water over her, buckets of water over me. Somebody came out with a hosepipe..."" He faces skin grafts and plastic surgery to treat the burns to his stomach, neck, ear, arm and back. ""I feel like somebody's ironing me 24/7,"" he said. John Tomlin, 24, faces two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent over the incident. Acid was again used as a weapon in an attack on a packed east London nightclub on Easter Monday. Two people were partially blinded by the attack at the Mangle nightclub in Hackney on 17 April, while other victims were left disfigured. One victim, Sophie Hall, described how ""there was panic... and I just started crying because my face felt as if it was on fire"". ""The acid had run down my cheeks and burnt into my skin. I was hysterical,"" she said. The ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann is one of those charged. Arthur Collins faces 14 counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and one count of throwing an acidic liquid with intent to do GBH to multiple people. TV presenter and author Katie Piper also became well known for her bravery and campaigning after an ex-boyfriend arranged an acid attack on her in 2008. David Lynch and accomplice Stefan Sylvestre both got life sentences. The UK has one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world - and the problem is growing, according to campaign group Acid Survivors Trust International (ACTI). Citing police figures, it says most attacks happen in London and that corrosive substances were used in 458 crimes in the city in 2016, compared to 261 in 2015. The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, told LBC radio: ""I don't want people to think this is happening all over London all the time, it is really not, but we are concerned because the numbers appear to be going up."" In 2013, two young British women were left with horrific burns after an acid attack during a volunteering trip in Zanzibar, east Africa. South Asian countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh also often record acid attacks. Women are usually the victims, left disfigured after rejecting marriage proposals or sexual advances. The crimes often go unreported for fear of reprisals, according to ACTI. Calls to tighten the sale of acid are growing after the recent attacks in the UK and a petition now has more than 360,000 names. Substances such as heavy-duty drain cleaners are relatively easy to buy from hardware stores and online. Campaigners are calling for a licensing system or for the buyer to go through checks and have their details held on a database. Carrying sulphuric acid without justification should also be a criminal offence, according to Labour MP Stephen Timms. Mr Timms, who will lead a debate on the subject on Monday, said: ""I think that carrying acid should in itself be an offence, in the same way that carrying a knife wouldn't have been an offence some years ago.""

Charlie's parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates want the judge to rule that their 11-month-old son, who suffers from a rare genetic condition, should be allowed to undergo a therapy trial overseen by Dr Hirano in New York. But who is Dr Hirano and how can he help? :: Developments at the High Court on Friday :: What next for Charlie Gard case? :: Timeline: Parents' battle to save Charlie Gard Dr Hirano studied at Harvard College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and completed his neurology training at Columbia University Medical Center. His research focuses on mitochondrial diseases - a group of disorders caused by dysfunctional mitochondria which fail to produce enough energy for cell or organ function - and his areas of expertise include neuromuscular disease, myopathy (muscle disease) and muscular dystrophy. He is an elected member of the American Neurological Association and a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology. On Thursday, Dr Hirano gave evidence to the High Court, via a link from New York. The judge said he wanted to hear what he believes has changed since he gave his ruling in April. Dr Hirano responded by saying he has clinical data which was not available in April and that he still believes the therapy is ""worth trying"" on Charlie. The doctor estimated a 10% chance of improvement in muscle strength and a ""small but significant"" improvement in brain function. Dr Hirano is due to travel to London on Tuesday to examine Charlie."
2017-07-14,EasyJet is creating a new airline so it can continue flying in the European Union after Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170715004133/http://news.sky.com/story/easyjet-launches-bid-to-fly-in-eu-after-brexit-10948116,"It has applied for a new air operator certificate in Austria at a cost of £10m. The budget airline said the application process was ""well advanced"" and it hoped to receive the accreditation ""in the near future"". It will allow the low-cost carrier to establish easyJetEurope, which will have its headquarters in the Austrian capital Vienna. Since the 1990s, EU airlines have been free to fly between any two points in Europe. This is planning for a worst case scenario should Britain fail to negotiate the same aviation freedoms it currently enjoys as a member of the EU. The company said the move would enable the airline to operate flights both across Europe and domestically within Europe once Britain exits the EU - ""regardless of the outcome of talks on a future UK-EU aviation agreement"". The establishment of the new hub will create new jobs in Austria, but the airline asserted ""no jobs will move from the UK to Austria"" and that ""nothing will change"" from the perspective of passengers. ""All of easyJet's UK employees will continue to be based in Luton and our 11 UK bases and employed as they are today,"" the firm said. ""Given the importance of aviation to all the economies of Europe as an enabler of trade, tourism and travel, we think it is important that the aviation market remains as open and competitive as possible. ""While the new structure will protect all of easyJet's current flying rights within Europe, easyJet will continue to push for the UK and EU to reach an aviation agreement which, at a minimum, will enable flights between the UK and EU."" UK ministers have said maintaining ""liberal access"" to European aviation markets will be a ""top priority"" during the Brexit negotiations which got under way in June. Under present rules, airlines operating within the EU must be majority owned by EU nationals. EasyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his family hold Cypriot passports and own 33% of shares in the business. The firm currently also has airlines based in the UK and Switzerland. All three airlines will be owned by easyJet plc, which will be EU-owned and controlled, listed on the London Stock Exchange and based in the UK. A Government spokesman said ministers were ""committed to securing liberal access to European aviation markets which has brought huge benefits to consumers across the EU""."
2017-07-14,Two police forces in the South West have set up the UK's first operational drone squad to fight crime.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170715004133/http://news.sky.com/story/full-time-flying-squad-police-launch-first-24-hour-drone-unit-10947852,"Forces up and down the country have been trialling the use of the mini aircraft as a cheaper alternative to helicopters for a number of roles, but now Devon and Cornwall police and the Dorset force have combined to launch a unit which will eventually have 40 officers trained to fly the drones. At £2,000 each, compared with £800 an hour for a helicopter, it's easy to see why police accountants like the DJI Inspire 1s drone option, but senior officers say the new unit will add flexibility and speed to a range of operations. The head of the unit, Chief Superintendent Jim Nye, said: ""Drones will aid officers as part of missing person searches; crime scene photography; responding to major road traffic collisions; coastal and woodland searches and to combat wildlife crime. ""Drones can even help police track and monitor suspects during a firearm or terrorist incident, as it will allow officers to gain vital information, quickly, safely, and allow us to respond effectively at the scene."" The two forces have been monitoring the effectiveness of drones in a variety of scenarios, and with heat-seeking cameras available they can be used both day and night. The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, says the new equipment will help police forces facing cuts to their budgets. But Phill Matthews from the federation says: ""It's no coincidence the financial predicament that every force up and down the country has found themselves in has forced them to look at new technology and to look at doing things differently. ""What the cuts have done have focused people's minds a bit at looking at different ways and avenues."" Privacy lawyer Charlotte Harris says drones are ""the start of a slippery slope"". ""Will people know if they're being watched, will a drone be something you can identify, will it be something which is going to be in a public place, how many individuals who aren't part of an investigation will be affected by this?"" The police drone pilots, like everyone else in the UK, will be bound by civil aviation authority rules governing the flying of the unmanned aircraft, but crucially, police can override them if they believe the situation necessitates it and that is likely to set off alarm bells with the civil rights lobby. Drones from the trial have been used to help secure convictions in court cases, with evidence from them being used in jury bundles. They have also located missing people and taken images of major crime scenes. Mr Nye said that in the future, he anticipated that drones would be used to assist in counter-terrorism operations."

Another meeting is planned in Bournemouth West - which has been Conservative since its creation in 1950 but saw a 6.6% swing to Labour cut the Tory majority almost in half in June. Speaking at a rally in Southampton, the Labour leader will say he hopes to win Itchen at the next election ""whenever it is called"". He will say: ""Theresa May's Government, propped up by the DUP, is nothing more than a zombie Government; with no ideas, no answers and no leadership. ""This is a Government in name only, having to ask other parties to 'clarify and improve' its policies and delaying most parliamentary business until the autumn. ""If the Conservatives are unable to govern, they should step aside. Labour is no longer just the official opposition, we are a government in waiting."" Mr Corbyn will visit Labour's top target seat Southampton Itchen, which the party held from 1992 to 2015 and came within 31 votes of regaining last month. In Bournemouth West he will attend what is being branded a ""member mobilisation"" event. The constituency is now 117th on Labour's target list. The Labour Leader has this month already visited the Conservative marginals of Hastings and Rye, Hendon and Chingford and Woodford Green. Labour needs to gain Tory constituencies if it is become the largest party and form the next government. Mr Corbyn has suggested that the next election could happen much sooner than the next scheduled date of 2022."
2017-07-14,The impact of Brexit has landed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170715004133/http://news.sky.com/story/easyjets-new-airline-is-a-clever-and-expensive-response-to-brexit-10948538,"There will now be three easyJets, all with a capital letter in the wrong place and all located in different places - one in the UK, one in Switzerland and now one in Austria. This new airline, easyJetEurope, will come with its own fleet of planes and its own staff, but make no mistake - it is part of easyJet's UK operations. The planes won't actually spend their lives in Austria, the big decisions will still be made in Luton. This is a clever, and rather expensive, answer to a new problem. For easyJet, this is a £10m insurance policy against the dreaded prospect of having to curtail - hugely - its timetable of flights around Europe. That might seem an unlikely prospect, but it's one that is now giving sleepless nights to plenty within Britain's airline industry. Put simply, there is a huge and complex set of rules that governs the ability of airlines to fly their planes. They govern which countries the airlines can start off from, where they can go to, which passengers they can pick up, where they can drop them off, and then where they can fly to next. They are rules of which most of us have remained oblivious to for years. After all, when you get on a plane you tend to take it for granted that the flight is allowed to go to its destination. But these rules (often abbreviated to ""Open Skies"", even though that bit actually just regulates flights across the Atlantic) are a construct of the European Union. And so, if Brexit happened tomorrow, the UK would drop out of the regulatory framework and, all of a sudden, many of the flights between Britain and Europe would be grounded. Talk to just about anyone in the airline industry and they'll tell you that such a scenario would be so damaging to both sides that it's almost impossible to conceive. British passengers want to come to Europe to do business or go on holiday, and vice versa. Nobody, so the argument runs, benefits if the UK leaves the EU without some kind of refreshed airspace agreement. But the problem is that while it may be almost impossible to imagine that scenario, it's not actually impossible. It could happen. The politics of the EU are Byzantine and unpredictable at the best of times, and the negotiations around Brexit will be long, complicated and full of pockets of European self-interest. There may just be those politicians who rather like the idea of leaving British planes standing idle on the tarmac for a while. For the British airline industry, we can divide the problem into two parts. Firstly, it's flights that start in the UK and fly to a foreign destination - Manchester to Madrid, for example, or Heathrow to New York. Secondly, it's the flights that are run by a UK airline, but which fly entirely outside the UK. Let's say, for example, from Barcelona to Paris or between Berlin and Nice. Both of those routes are offered by easyJet. It is in order to protect these intra-European flights that easyJet has created its new company. By having a new European operation, based in Austria, it can claim an Air Operators Certificate and that, in turn, means it can fly routes within the European Union. This is exactly the same logic as many big banks, especially American banks, are now applying. Like airline companies, they don't know what regulatory framework likes ahead, and nor do they have the luxury of being able to wait and see. In fact, they have legal obligations to manage risks and make contingency plans. In the case of banks, that means adding to their British operations by setting up subsidiaries on the European mainland, allowing them to carry on working across Europe. Easyjet, really, has just done the same thing. This is a tangible example of the Brexit impact, and it won't be the last. But of all the major industries fretting about what could happen over the next couple of years, the aviation business appears to face a distinctly different set of variables. The concept of Open Skies is so embedded into our life that we take it for granted. The mere kernel of an idea that it could disappear, that planes could be grounded and flights to Europe might be suspended, is causing nerves and consternation. For easyJet, perhaps the company most worried about the impact of this disruption, this quick response might look dramatic - but it also looks smart."
2017-07-14,The Government helped to secure more than £240m in investment from Toyota with a letter reassuring the carmaker over post-Brexit trade.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170715004133/http://news.sky.com/story/toyota-received-government-assurances-over-240m-investment-10948851,"Toyota announced in March that it would install its new car platform at its plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) has confirmed to the Reuters news agency that the letter exists, but has refused to release it and comment further. A source told Reuters the letter was similar to one sent to fellow Japanese firm Nissan last year, when it decided to build two new models at its Sunderland plant. The letter provoked concerns about the carmaker being offered a ""sweetheart deal"" by the Government. Business Secretary Greg Clark, who has refused to release the Nissan letter, said last year that the assurances offered to Nissan were available to other companies. On the subject of the Toyota letter, the Reuters' source said it contained a number of assurances, but did not say when it was sent. ""They received a similar set of warm words as Nissan on electric vehicles, commitment to further training and to ensure the competitiveness of the UK automotive industry,"" they said. A spokesman for Toyota declined to say whether the firm had received such a letter. He referred to the company's statement in March, which said the Government was providing the company more than £21m for training and research and development. Toyota also said at the time that ""continued tariff-and-barrier free market access ... will be vital for future success"". Reuters submitted Freedom of Information requests to DBEIS asking for documents relating to the Toyota decision to be released. In its response, the department confirmed there was a letter, but refused to release it along with a company briefing note. It said the information was ""both highly commercially sensitive"" and ""would be likely to cause harm to the company's commercial interests if disclosed"". The department did however reveal that Mr Clark had meetings with Toyota officials in September, November and March. The Brexit vote has left a number of the world's biggest car firms worried about the long-term viability of their British operations. Many are pushing the Government for promises to maintain free trade after Brexit takes effect in March 2019. Nissan, Toyota and another Japanese company, Honda, account for around half of British car production. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met Prime Minister Theresa May in April and called for a smooth Brexit in order for Japanese firms to be able to continue to operate."
2017-07-14,"Royal Mail has offered staff a choice between a defined benefit or contribution pension scheme, after opposition from trade unions including the threat of possible strike action.
",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170715004133/http://news.sky.com/story/royal-mail-offers-staff-new-pension-plan-to-avert-strike-10948459,"But while one of the two unions representing workers planned to vote on the new proposal, the other rejected it. Royal Mail announced in April that it planned to close its defined benefit pension scheme from March next year on cost grounds, following a consultation with the plan's 90,000 members. A review found it would need to more than double annual contributions to more than £1bn to keep the plan running. However on Friday, Royal Mail said it had made a new offer to members which included the option of a more affordable replacement defined benefit pension scheme. It said it had held ""extensive talks"" with both unions - Unite, which represents the firm's managerial staff, as well as the Communication Workers Union, which represents frontline workers. It said Unite was planning to hold a consultative ballot of its members on the new proposal because it believes this is the ""best available deal"" and a ""significant improvement"" on an earlier proposal. But the CWU rejected the proposal, arguing it ""does not meet our aspiration of a wage in retirement pension scheme"". Terry Pullinger, the CWU's deputy general secretary for postal, said it ""still promotes the conventional wisdom of a cash-out arrangement at the point of retirement"". ""It would still represent a significant shortfall in the pensions promise and it is not something that we are prepared to recommend to our members,"" he added. A defined benefit plan pays out an amount according to workers' final salary and length of service. A defined contribution plan payout depends on how much workers and employers have put in during the course of the scheme. Under the new proposals, the defined benefit cash balance scheme would provide members with a guaranteed lump sum at retirement, with Royal Mail upping its contribution. Staff would also have the option of joining a new defined contribution scheme as an alternative."

Mahad Egal and his family lived on the fourth floor of the tower and managed to escape the blaze. Since that night, Mr Egal has spent every day knocking on doors, asking residents for information and collating any details he has into a list that he says is more reliable than that of the police. ""My list is still in progress but it is much more than 80 people presumed dead, more than one hundred, even,"" he said. ""The official figures are not a fair reflection and as a resident of the tower I know more information about the families who were living there. If they had guests staying with them, for example. ""We know this because we are on the ground and we want the authorities to come and speak with us."" Mahad has been supported in his investigation by childhood friend Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle in the fire. Like many relatives, Karim is still awaiting official confirmation about his uncle and says he is frustrated at what seems to be a lack of action. ""It's been a month and there have been no arrests, no named suspects. ""The least the police could tell us is that they are talking to the council today, or the tenant's management organisation who were in charge of the management of the tower and had a duty of care. ""It just feels like the police aren't chasing information and because of this we are having to carry out our own investigation into what happened to our loved ones."" A software engineering student in Brussels has emerged as a credible collator of information about the Grenfell Tower. Joshua Vantard, 26, has been using crowdsourcing techniques to create a database of names of those who have been found or who are missing. He estimates the death toll is in the 90s. ""I believe a lot more names of people are going to be released by the authorities as having perished; however, I am not sure it's quite as high as people on social media seem to think it's going to be,"" he said. ""There is obviously a lot more hard work to be done."" On Monday police said they believed 350 people were in the tower on the night of the fire, with 255 of those surviving and around 80 not making it out. They also explained that the enormity of the devastation means the recovery operation is painstaking and slow. Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy, who is leading the operation, said: ""I do not want there to be any hidden victims of this terrible tragedy. ""We have an absolute commitment to finding the answers - we know that will never be quick enough for those whose loved ones are missing."""

Although the number of drug users has fallen from 10.5% of 16 to 59-year-olds in England and Wales a decade ago to just over 8%, emerging trends like the use of former legal high Spice as well as chemsex drugs, which are used to enhance sexual activity, are causing concern. Chemsex commonly involves the use of crystal methamphetamine, known as crystal meth, GHB/GBL and mephedrone. The drugs carry serious mental and physical health risks, including the spread of blood borne viruses and infections. Ministers say a more joined up approach will be taken to tackling the causes and effects of drug abuse. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who will chair a new cross-government Drug Strategy board, said: ""Since becoming Home Secretary I have seen first-hand how drugs can destroy lives. I am determined to confront the scale of this issue and prevent drug misuse devastating our families and communities. ""This Government has driven a tough law enforcement response in the UK and at our borders, but this must go hand in hand with prevention and recovery. This new strategy brings together police, health, community and global partners to clamp down on the illicit drug trade, safeguard the most vulnerable, and help those affected to turn their lives around."" Amos Singh Dhami, 40, is in recovery from an addiction to cocaine that began 20 years ago. ""The consequences of my using were divorce, lost my driving licence, impact on my work, my family life, health - I was very close to death when I came in to treatment, my liver and kidneys were nearly packed up. It just affected every part of my life"" he says. ""Understanding the problem is massive. I don't think we have enough understanding about this illness. The consequences from it are crime, are health. ""It's the aftercare programme as well. The rehousing, the mental side, the job opportunities, everything really."" Health services will be required to check on the progress of recovering addicts after 12 months and prison officers will be given more support to help inmates tackle addiction. National Police Chiefs' Council Lead for Drugs, Commander Simon Bray, said: ""Illicit drugs feature in so many types of harm and crime; they are frequently used as a commodity by organised criminals and gangs, often linked to violence and exploitation of the vulnerable. Drugs are the root cause behind countless burglaries, thefts and robberies, and are often associated with anti-social behaviour and public concern. ""The Government has set out their new strategy for tackling the complex harms and issues associated with drugs and police will play our part in delivering it."" The strategy has attracted some criticism, with the Liberal Democrats warning it will not work. Their health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said: ""It totally fails to address a key problem: treating drug dependence as a criminal justice issue rather than a health one."" Martin Powell, from the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, added: ""It won't protect young people and communities because it is the same failed old recipe of criminalisation and underfunding that has led to record numbers of vulnerable people dying."""

The attacks involved a pair on a moped attacking other moped riders and allegedly stealing two bikes. Delivery driver Jabed Hussain, 32, was the first person attacked by the pair on Thursday evening. They approached him at 10.25pm as he rode towards the Hackney Road junction with Queensbridge and threw a corrosive substance in his face. Fearing a second attack Mr Hussain told Sky News he abandoned his bike and ran down the road trying to attract help. ""I was just begging for water because by that time it was burning on my face,"" he said. He said the attack felt ""like somebody put fire on my face"". Fortunately the acid only hit the left side of his face, although Mr Hussain said it still felt like his whole face was burning. Police officers doused Mr Hussain with large bottles of water to wash the substance off him, before taking him to an east London hospital. The attackers went on to target four more people over the next hour-and-a-half, at least one of whom was left with ""life changing"" injuries. :: Acid victim Katie Piper calls for tougher action The spate of attacks has led to calls for tougher sentences for attackers and restrictions on the sale of corrosive substances. Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""The recent spate of acid attacks have shocked the nation, but sadly they are nothing new.

Both are being held in custody at a north London police station and Scotland Yard said they are treating the attacks, which took place within 90 minutes, as linked. All five victims were taken to hospital, with one described as having life-changing injuries. The assaults involved a pair on a moped attacking other moped riders and allegedly stealing two bikes. The Metropolitan Police dismissed rumours all the victims were food delivery drivers set up in advance of the attacks. Those attacked were described as being ""from a variety of backgrounds"", while officers urged potential witnesses to come forward with information and photos and videos they may have recorded. Chief Inspector Ben Clark, from Hackney Borough, said: ""These are hideous offences and must have been very frightening for all of the victims. ""Of late we have seen more attacks using corrosive substances in London. ""I would urge businesses and parents to challenge those who they think may be trying to obtain or carry these substances as this could help prevent serious offences and life changing injuries being caused."" At the start of the rampage, at 10.25pm, a 32-year-old man was approached as he rode towards the Hackney Road junction with Queensbridge Road. The two attackers tossed a corrosive substance in his face before one jumped on his moped and rode away. Police dowsed the victim with large bottles of water, said witness Sarah Cobbold. The man went to an east London hospital but his injuries are not being treated as life-threatening or life-changing. Twenty minutes later, at around 10.50pm, a 44-year-old man was sprayed with liquid on the Upper Street junction with Highbury Corner, Islington. The victim was taken to a hospital in north London, but there is not yet an update on his condition. At 11.05pm, the two attackers swooped on a third man, a 24-year-old, on Shoreditch High Street, throwing acid in his face but stealing nothing. His injuries are life-changing, police said. Within 15 minutes they struck again, throwing the corrosive liquid at a man on Cazenove Road and causing ""life-changing"" facial injuries. The final assault was reported at 11.37pm, when a 33-year-old man was confronted as he sat on his moped in traffic on Chatsworth Road. He was also sprayed in the face, the moped stolen and both attackers fled. The victim made his way home before calling police, after which he was taken to hospital with no update on his condition. Witness John Moody told Sky News he heard a ""really nasty scream"" and ""banging, shouting and crashing"". ""They (police) took the guy's shirt off and started dowsing him in cold water,"" he said.

A petition to restrict the sale of acid and bring in a licence system currently has more than 360,000 names The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, said she is looking at whether a change in the law is needed. She told LBC Radio: ""I don't want people to think this is happening all over London all the time, it is really not, but we are concerned because the numbers appear to be going up.

Labour MP Stephen Timms, who will lead a House of Commons debate on the issue on Monday, has called for tougher sentences and suggested that carrying sulphuric acid without a good reason should be treated as seriously as carrying a knife. The attacks come days after a man appeared in court charged with throwing acid at a 21-year-old woman and her cousin.

Professor Jay took over in the wake of Dame Lowell Goddard's departure, and gets a salary of £185,000. Under rules introduced in 2010, all appointments that require ministerial approval and have salaries above £142,500 must be agreed by the chief secretary to the Treasury.

2017-07-14,A former producer on TV police drama The Bill has been jailed for 17 years over a plot to kill his partner so he could be with his lover.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170715004133/http://news.sky.com/story/former-the-bill-producer-jailed-over-girlfriend-murder-plot-10948310,"Retired 68-year-old David Harris was sentenced at London's Old Bailey over his attempts to hire three men to murder his wealthy partner in order to inherit her fortune. Harris, of Amberley, West Sussex, offered £200,000 to kill breast cancer survivor Hazel Allinson, who also previously worked on The Bill, in a planned ""mugging gone wrong"". The recovering alcoholic planned to sell Ms Allinson's £800,000 home and spend the rest of his life with his Lithuanian lover Ugne Cekaviciute, 28, who he met in a brothel. During their five-year affair, Harris showered the former professional basketball player with gifts and admitted getting into mounting debt. Sentencing the twice divorced father-of-one on Friday, Judge Anne Molyneux QC told Harris: ""For your pipe dream, for your obsessive infatuation with a young woman, Ms Allinson, who had protected and nurtured you, was to die a painful and terrifying death in an isolated spot. ""Her death was to fund your life. You had used her until she had outlasted her usefulness to you. ""All that you wanted from her was that she should die and you should inherit her money."" Harris had previously been convicted by a jury of three charges of soliciting murder, after they rejected his explanation he only wanted to talk to hitmen as research for a murder mystery novel. Between February and March 2016, Harris asked Chris May to commit his partner's murder, but the mechanic instead repeatedly warned Ms Allinson over the threat to her life. Harris then tried to solicit a second man, Duke Dean, between August and November 2016 to kill Ms Allinson but he also did not go through with it and reported Harris to City of London Police. In a third attempt to have his partner murdered, Harris contacted a third man, an undercover officer he believed to be called ""Chris"", on 11 November last year. In a secret recording released by the police following Friday's sentencing, Harris can be heard giving the undercover officer his partner's schedule and asking for the murder to be carried out within a week. Harris was arrested the day after meeting the undercover officer, when police burst into a room at Balham Lodge Hotel, south London, to find him lying naked in bed with Ms Cekaviciute. During the 13-day trial, the court was told how Harris blew £50,000 of Ms Allinson's savings, borrowed thousands from neighbours and pawned a gold wristwatch and diamond ring. He pretended to umpire matches for Arundel Castle Cricket Club and tend to his sick brother in a mental hospital as cover for his secret trysts with Ms Cekaviciute. Jurors heard Harris once sneaked his younger lover into his partner's home and photographed her posing naked on a bed with Ms Allinson's three spaniels."
2017-07-14,"Taxpayers received ""value for money"" from the sale of Government shares in Royal Bank of Scotland two years ago, despite making a loss of nearly £2bn, according to the public spending watchdog.

At the time of the controversial sale of the 5.4% stake, it was forecast that it would represent a £1bn loss for taxpayers. However, the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed on Friday that the overall losses on the sale actually reached £1.9bn - significantly more than previously thought. It confirmed details of the sale were leaked into the market around an hour before the official announcement. Shares plunged 8% in the three days before the sale as hedge funds bet against RBS. But the NAO, which has examined the circumstances of the sale, said this ""did not affect the taxpayer negatively"", adding that short-selling ahead of the sale was ""not out of the ordinary"". The NAO said UK Financial Investments (UKFI) - the body charged with managing Government stakes in banks - executed the sale ""as skilfully as could reasonably be expected, and on the basis of the preparation, process and proceeds of the transaction, UKFI achieved value for money"". Its report comes almost nine years after the bank was rescued with more than £45bn of taxpayers' money. The bailout of RBS took place at an average 'in-price' of 502p. But the Chancellor at the time of the sale of the taxpayers' shareholding - George Osborne - said he was no longer prepared to wait for the bank's shares to recover to that level before beginning the sale process. The sale came under heavy criticism at the time after the Government offloaded its first tranche of shares in RBS at a 52-week low. Labour warned Mr Osborne against a summer sale of shares in RBS, arguing that it is not ""an impossible objective"" to recoup the public's investment if a disposal is delayed. The bank remains more than 70% owned by the public purse. The Government has however since fully sold its stake in Lloyds Banking Group. The NAO report also comes just days after RBS agreed a £4.2bn settlement in the US over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage bonds ahead of the financial crisis. The current Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has signalled that RBS needs to resolve many of its legacy issues before another share sale can be considered. Before the General Election, he said fair value for the stake could be below the 502p paid by the Labour government in 2008."

That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. What Charlie's parents are now hoping is that the evidence given by Dr Hirano, in discussion with the other experts, will be enough to persuade the judge that it is now in Charlie's best interests to have the therapy being offered. That treatment would presumably mean transferring Charlie to a hospital in New York. Again, the court would have to consider whether this would be in his best interests.

He said his religion had made him a ""subject of suspicion"" and that he thought ""there isn't a way forward out of this"" without either compromising on his evangelical Christian faith or causing damage to the party. Speaking about his decision, Mr Farron told the BBC: ""I made the decision about two weeks into the election campaign. ""I thought there isn't a way forward out of this without me either compromising or just causing damage to the party in the long run. ""I kind of thought well, in which case I cannot see a way I will continue to be leader into the future. ""But I kind of thought, right you've got to put that into a drawer, don't talk to anybody else about it, get on and do as good a job as you can during the election.""

The outgoing Lib Dem leader said he ""compartmentalised"" his decision to quit whilst he was campaigning, and denied he had deceived voters who backed his party. ""Well, they're giving the party the vote, and the Lib Dems, thanks to what we've done in the last two years, will continue,"" Mr Farron told the BBC.

Ahead of the funeral, people filled the streets of Blackhall as Bradley's coffin was taken to St Joseph's Catholic Church - where he was baptised six years ago. A piper led the coffin, which was in a carriage pulled by white horses draped with his favourite team Sunderland's red and white stripes. Friends and relatives walked behind dressed in superhero costumes and football shirts with 'Bradley' and the number six printed on the back. A spontaneous applause broke out as the cortege passed crowds and some people released balloons. The family said the funeral was open to everyone and that there was no formal dress code. The service was played on speakers outside the church for people who were not able to fit inside. Father Ian Jackson led the service and paid tribute to Bradley, saying he was a ""bright, brave, loving, cheeky monkey"". Bradley was a mascot several times for Sunderland last season, Defoe's former club, as well as for England at Wembley. Sunderland players John O'Shea, Lee Cattermole and Vito Mannone and the club's former manager David Moyes attended the service. Sunderland AFC's chaplain Marc Lyden-Smith spoke at the service, saying Bradley ""has done much more than just touch the hearts of so many football fans"". ""He has been more than a mascot to Sunderland Football Club, he has been an encouragement to many and a loving smile to all of us,"" he added. Bradley, who died from the rare childhood cancer neuroblastoma last week, formed a special bond with Defoe. ""God has you in his arms and I will always carry you in my heart. Sleep tight little one. My best friend,"" the footballer wrote in a tribute to the boy. Ahead of the funeral, the family wrote on Facebook: ""Family and friends have chosen the theme cancer has no colours. So they are wearing football tops it doesn't matter what team or colour."" Bradley died on 7 July at home in the arms of his parents Gemma and Carl."
2017-07-15,Prince Charles has held a private party for the Duchess of Cornwall to celebrate her 70th birthday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/duchess-of-cornwall-celebrates-70th-birthday-amid-growing-popularity-10950138,"Family and close friends were invited to the event on his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire last night ahead of Camilla's actual birthday on Monday. It's an occasion that has led many newspapers and commentators to reflect on the Duchess's position within the Royal Family and ask whether public perception has changed towards the woman who for years lived in the shadow of Prince Charles's ex-wife Princess Diana. Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty Magazine said: ""The public were doubtful about Camilla and that's one of the reasons their marriage was, for a royal wedding, low-key. ""What she did was very gently introduce herself into royal life, so to start with she did very few engagements she was just at Prince Charles's side so people could she was supportive of him. ""She always did charity work but it was very low profile, and then she took on some perhaps less glamorous charities, and very, very slowly she just was herself and people saw what a nice lady she is."" There is still debate about whether the general public would accept her as Queen when Prince Charles becomes King. In April constitutional expert Lord Norton of Louth, a peer in the House of Lords and professor at the University of Hull, told Sky News the constitutional position is very clear. He said: ""Upon the death of the Queen, Charles automatically becomes King, that is it, his wife will become Queen Consort, formally established by precedent. But if she wishes to be known by another title, that's a matter of royal prerogative, so the monarch could determine that another style will be employed."" When they were married in April 2005 it was announced that Camilla would be given, what some saw as the lesser title of Princess Consort and not Queen Consort when her husband became King. Some suggested it was a nod to the public mood about their relationship and the death of Princess Diana. Ms Seward said: ""The whole Diana situation has always been very difficult for Camilla. It won't go away and hasn't gone away. But she can't really acknowledge it as it is 20 years ago and whatever she does she doesn't comment on it. ""Obviously there are people who will never like Camilla as they see her as the person who broke up the marriage."" In the past decade Camilla has become an important part of the upper tier of the Royal Family, she carries out Royal duties on behalf of the Queen, and was also made a privy councillor by her mother in law. Her charity work is also worthy of acknowledgement, but rarely gets a huge amount of media coverage. She has a particular interest in literacy, animal welfare, osteoporosis but more striking is her work with rape crisis and domestic violence charities and the support she has given to campaigns against human trafficking and female genital mutilation. Her 70th birthday has brought renewed interest in Camilla, probably quite overwhelming for a woman who is more than happy to stay out of the limelight when she can."

Five separate male victims, all on mopeds, were allegedly targeted by two attackers also on a moped. Among the charges against the 16-year-old are five counts of GBH with intent and one count of possession of an item to discharge a noxious substance. He has been remanded in custody and will appear before Stratford Youth Court on Monday. A 15-year-old boy who was arrested in Stoke Newington on Friday morning has been released on bail until early August. All five victims of the attacks were all taken to hospital and one was described as being left with ""life-changing"" facial injuries. Those attacked were described as being ""from a variety of backgrounds"". Officers urged potential witnesses to come forward with information and photos and videos they may have recorded. Chief Inspector Ben Clark, from Hackney Borough, said: ""These are hideous offences and must have been very frightening for all of the victims. ""Of late we have seen more attacks using corrosive substances in London. ""I would urge businesses and parents to challenge those who they think may be trying to obtain or carry these substances as this could help prevent serious offences and life changing injuries being caused."" Meanwhile, the Government will outline a new strategy on combating acid attacks in the Commons on Monday. The Home Office says it will be working with police and the Ministry of Justice to assess whether powers available to the courts, including sentencing, are sufficient. One of the proposals will be to ensure acid and other corrosive substances can be classed as dangerous weapons, which under the Prevention of Crime Act carries a four-year maximum penalty. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""Acid attacks are horrific crimes which have a devastating effect on victims, both physically and emotionally. ""It is vital that we do everything we can to prevent these sickening attacks happening in the first place. ""We must also ensure that the police and other emergency services are able to respond as effectively as possible, that sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences and victims are given the immediate support they need."" :: Any witnesses, anyone with information or in possession of footage of the five acid attacks should contact police via 101 or via Twitter @MetCC.

The two women who died were German, security officials said, while the four others hurt included citizens of Ukraine and the Czech Republic. Hurghada is one of Egypt's most popular beach resorts, particularly with Ukrainians and other European tourists. Security has been tightened in tourist resorts around the country as the industry is a major revenue stream for Egypt. The attack came after five police officers were shot dead in Cairo's twin city of Giza when suspected Islamic militants opened fire on their vehicle early on Friday morning.

He claimed the meeting was billed as part of a Russian government effort to help Mr Trump during last year's US presidential election campaign. The lobbyist said Mr Trump Jr was disappointed when he asked for evidence of illicit money flowing to the rival Democratic National Committee and Ms Veselnitskaya could not provide it. Mr Akhmetshin said the group's conversation was ""not substantive"" and he ""actually expected more serious"" discussion. :: US divided over Donald Trump links to Russia The latest revelation adds another shift to the tale that has sparked questions over the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Mr Trump Jr did not disclose Mr Akhmetshin's presence in statements and emails he released earlier this week about the meeting. The correspondence showed Mr Trump Jr was told Russian figures wanted to meet to pass on negative information about Democrat Hilary Clinton. Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and current White House senior adviser, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the discussion. :: Why is President Trump so soft on Russia? The Russian government has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the June 2016 meeting. Asked on Friday about Mr Akhmetshin, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""We don't know anything about this person."" :: Russia emails could determine Trump's fate Ms Veselnitskaya said she was not working for Russian authorities, but she told The Wall Street Journal that she was meeting with Russian authorities regularly. She said she shared information about a US-born fund manager who lobbied for passage of the Magnitsky Act with the Russian prosecutor generals office, including with Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, a top official appointed by the Kremlin, the Journal said. But Ms Veselnitskaya was described by a US businessman who will give testimony to a Senate committee against her as a ""well-resourced player"". William Brodwer told Sky News: ""She is paid by and works for a man named Denis Katsyv. Mr Katsyv was the governor of the Moscow region, which is the size of France. ""He's currently the vice-president of Russian Railways, which is probably the second most important Russian government company after [energy firm] Gasprom. ""He is a senior member of the Putin regime. It's just not credible to say she's not connected to the government."" Mr Browder added that Mr Akhmetshin was effectively Ms Veselnitskaya's ""guide through the political corridors of power in Washington"". ""There is no such thing as being a former member of Russian intelligence,"" he said. ""I don't believe what the Russians say and given the changing stories from the US side it's hard to believe what they say as well."" Who is Rinat Akhmetshin? Details on Mr Akhmetshin's identity come mostly from a letter sent earlier this year from the US Senate's Judiciary Committee chairman to the head of Homeland Security. It says the lobbyist is Russian-born, but moved to the US in the 1990s and became an American citizen in 2009. Mr Akhmetshin is described as a former ""Soviet counter-intelligence officer"", who worked for the GRU - Russian foreign military intelligence. The letter cites reports that he ""specialises in 'active campaign measures', ie subversive political influence operations often involving disinformation and propaganda"". It says Mr Akhmetshin denied the allegations, despite his ""admission to the press that he had been a Russian intelligence officer, in response to a different press inquiry"". Speaking after his presence at the 2016 meeting emerged, Mr Akhmetshin claimed he was drafted to serve in the Soviet Army from 1986 to 1988 but was not trained in any spy tradecraft."

That treatment would presumably mean transferring Charlie to a hospital in New York. Again, the court would have to consider whether this would be in his best interests. If everything goes according to plan, Mr Justice Francis hopes to give his ruling at the end of the hearing on 25 July."
2017-07-15,A second teenager has been arrested by police investigating five linked acid attacks in London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/police-investigate-four-linked-acid-attacks-in-east-london-10947918,"A 15-year-old was arrested on Friday morning on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and robbery following the ""hideous"" attacks on Thursday night. A 16-year-old was already being held on suspicion of the same offences after being identified near the scene of the attacks by CCTV. Both are being held in custody at a north London police station and Scotland Yard said they are treating the attacks, which took place within 90 minutes, as linked. All five victims were taken to hospital, with one described as having life-changing injuries. The assaults involved a pair on a moped attacking other moped riders and allegedly stealing two bikes. The Metropolitan Police dismissed rumours all the victims were food delivery drivers set up in advance of the attacks. Those attacked were described as being ""from a variety of backgrounds"", while officers urged potential witnesses to come forward with information and photos and videos they may have recorded. Chief Inspector Ben Clark, from Hackney Borough, said: ""These are hideous offences and must have been very frightening for all of the victims. ""Of late we have seen more attacks using corrosive substances in London. ""I would urge businesses and parents to challenge those who they think may be trying to obtain or carry these substances as this could help prevent serious offences and life changing injuries being caused."" At the start of the rampage, at 10.25pm, a 32-year-old man was approached as he rode towards the Hackney Road junction with Queensbridge Road. The two attackers tossed a corrosive substance in his face before one jumped on his moped and rode away. Police dowsed the victim with large bottles of water, said witness Sarah Cobbold. The man went to an east London hospital but his injuries are not being treated as life-threatening or life-changing. Twenty minutes later, at around 10.50pm, a 44-year-old man was sprayed with liquid on the Upper Street junction with Highbury Corner, Islington. The victim was taken to a hospital in north London, but there is not yet an update on his condition. At 11.05pm, the two attackers swooped on a third man, a 24-year-old, on Shoreditch High Street, throwing acid in his face but stealing nothing. His injuries are life-changing, police said. Within 15 minutes they struck again, throwing the corrosive liquid at a man on Cazenove Road and causing ""life-changing"" facial injuries. The final assault was reported at 11.37pm, when a 33-year-old man was confronted as he sat on his moped in traffic on Chatsworth Road. He was also sprayed in the face, the moped stolen and both attackers fled. The victim made his way home before calling police, after which he was taken to hospital with no update on his condition. Witness John Moody told Sky News he heard a ""really nasty scream"" and ""banging, shouting and crashing"". ""They (police) took the guy's shirt off and started dowsing him in cold water,"" he said. ""As they were doing this more police arrived and also more food delivery moped riders."" A petition to restrict the sale of acid and bring in a licence system currently has more than 360,000 names The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, said she is looking at whether a change in the law is needed. She told LBC Radio: ""I don't want people to think this is happening all over London all the time, it is really not, but we are concerned because the numbers appear to be going up. ""We will arrest people, we will enforce the law as we can, and we are working very closely with the Home Office to try to see if there is any changes in the law required."" Labour MP Stephen Timms, who will lead a House of Commons debate on the issue on Monday, has called for tougher sentences and suggested that carrying sulphuric acid without a good reason should be treated as seriously as carrying a knife. The attacks come days after a man appeared in court charged with throwing acid at a 21-year-old woman and her cousin. Resham Khan, 21, and Jameel Muhktar, 37, were left with life-changing injuries after the attack in Beckton, east London, on 21 June. There was another acid attack in east London on Easter Monday, leaving two people at a nightclub partially blinded and others injured. :: Any witnesses, anyone with information or in possession of footage of these incidents should contact police via 101 or via Twitter @MetCC.

2017-07-15,US President Donald Trump has called for a glass wall to be built along the border with Mexico.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-proposes-glass-border-wall-with-mexico-10949128,"He said though it was a ""crazy"" idea, the wall would need to be see-through to stop passers-by being hit with heavy sacks of drugs being thrown over it. ""One of the things with the wall is you need transparency,"" he told journalists on a flight to Pairs. ""You have to be able to see through it. ""So it could be a steel wall with openings, but you have to have openings because you have to see what's on the other wide of the wall. ""And I'll give you an example. As horrible as it sounds, when they throw large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don't see them. ""They hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It's over. ""As crazy as that sounds, you need transparency through that wall. But we have some incredible designs."" The comments were made on Thursday to reporters, while Mr Trump was travelling on Air Force One to a state visit in France. They came to light hours later, only after journalists realised he was serious and wanted them reported. Andres Rozental, Mexico's former deputy foreign minister and ambassador to the UK, told Sky News the idea was ""the most ridiculous thing I have heard in many, many years"". He added: ""It just doesn't make any sense. It's not true."" Mr Rozental estimated there was a ""less than 20% chance that this wall - as he calls it - will ever be built"". He cited tough opposition in the US congress and among communities clustered along the country's border with Mexico as Mr Trump's biggest challenges. The wall was one of Mr Trump's central promises of his 2016 presidential campaign."
2017-07-15,Satellite technology is being developed to track down and stop a crime wave that is costing the UK an estimated £1bn a year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/new-satellite-technology-may-mean-fly-tipping-days-are-numbered-10949246,"Illegal dumping of waste has been called the new narcotics, with profits said to rival that of the drugs trade. Now satellite imaging is so advanced that vast areas of the countryside, hidden from ground view and therefore perfect for fly tipping, can be scanned in detail; and illegal dumps, even if they are buried, can be discovered. Retired geography professor Ray Harris is one of those behind the technique. He said: ""It doesn't tell us where every single waste site is, it just narrows down the possibilities. ""We're looking for a needle in a haystack but we're trying to get rid of the haystack and that reveals where the needle might be."" Mr Harris believes that, as word spreads among the fly tippers, they will become more wary. ""The more this technology is used the greater the deterrent will be for criminals. ""They'll think: 'Oh I can't just hide this big waste pile in my back garden because I've got to look upwards and think I'm going to be surveyed from the sky'."" Dumping waste legally is not cheap - a single skip can cost you hundreds of pounds to get rid of and, for criminal gangs with access to land, that presents the potential to make big money by undercutting legitimate businesses. Jack Goodman, who runs a waste site in east London, said disposing of the rubbish deposited there every year costs his business around £250,000. The criminals are so brazen they even rip off legal dumps, he added. ""We've had incidences where they come in (and said) 'yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine we'll use the weigh bridge'. ""They tip and just drive out, speed off."" To add insult to injury, his business then has to pay to dispose of the criminals' waste. ""We're out of pocket because they've tipped and literally sped off. ""We try to stop them but you can't jump in front of the lorry so there's not really much you can do."" But illegal tipping is not just about money - it ruins lives as well. Jan Watkins from Orpington lives near to what used to be a legitimate dump. It broke its licence and allowed too much waste to be disposed of, prompting the council to close it. The council is still in the process of clearing the site but have had to put the clean-up on hold because toxic material has been discovered in the waste. ""It was taller than the trees,"" Mrs Watkins said of the waste. ""There was a telephone pole that was 50 feet high and the rubbish was almost as high as that. ""It wasn't just an eyesore, at its peak the flies were unbelievable, the smells were absolutely dreadful. ""You couldn't open the doors and windows in the summer."" If the satellite, Spy In The Sky, does what its developers and the Environment Agency hopes then illegal tipping may be looking less profitable."
2017-07-15,"A 15-year-old girl died after being found unconscious at a Devon park due to an adverse reaction from a ""legal high"", police believe.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/girl-15-dies-after-falling-unconcious-from-legal-high-10949465,"The teenager was taken to hospital from Bakers Park, Newton Abbot, around 4.50am but later died in the early hours of Saturday. Devon and Cornwall Police said they believe she ""had taken a new psychoactive substance, more commonly referred to as 'legal highs', and had suffered adverse reaction"". Police believe the drug was illegal. The phrase ""legal high"" is still commonly used to refer to substances which may have been legal before the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 became law last year. Two other teenage girls were also taken to Torbay District Hospital as a precaution and have since been discharged. Officers want to speak to anyone with information about the incident, as well as anyone who was in the park in the early hours of Saturday. The teenager's family have been informed of her death while police are still at Bakers Park as they conduct initial enquiries. The Government this month unveiled a new strategy to target psychoactive substances, which were formerly known as ""legal highs"" before a blanket UK-wide ban came into force in May last year. Offenders who break the new laws face up to seven years in prison. In 2015, more than 100 deaths in the UK were linked to ""legal highs""."
2017-07-15,"Acid attack survivor Katie Piper has demanded a clampdown on corrosive substances to ""prevent more lives being destroyed"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/acid-victim-katie-piper-demands-government-action-on-attacks-10948700,"The TV presenter and model penned an open letter to urge Government action on the sale of acid and the introduction of tougher punishments to deter would-be offenders. Ms Piper, 33, described how survivors of acid attacks are handed a ""life sentence"" through the trauma of their ordeal. She published her plea for increased legislation in the wake of five acid attacks, believed to be linked, which took place within 90 minutes of each other in north and east London on Thursday night. It comes just a few weeks after aspiring model Resham Khan and her cousin Jameel Muhktar in east London were attacked while celebrating her 21st birthday. There was another acid attack in east London on Easter Monday, leaving two people at a nightclub partially blinded and others injured. The UK has one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world, with the crimes feared to be on the rise. :: Acid attacks: Calls to restrict sales Ms Piper was left partially blind and with severe, permanent scarring when a former boyfriend arranged for acid to be thrown in her face in 2008. Writing in the Scars, Burns and Healing journal, Ms Piper described how she has undergone 250 operations and hours of psychological therapy following the assault, which left her contemplating suicide. She wrote: ""I will continue to need operations and therapy for life. For acid attack survivors, the aftermath is a life sentence."" Urging the Government to impose harsher penalties on attackers who use corrosive substances, Ms Piper said: ""Lives can be destroyed in moments. ""Survivors of such attacks often have to live with the immediate fear that their attackers may still be at large, and in the longer term - even if the attackers are caught and sentenced - may be released to potentially live alongside them after serving a minimum term. ""I meet many inspiring individuals who have worked hard to rebuild their lives after an attack; however, it can be hard to stay motivated when the justice system does not always reflect the severity of these crimes."" Ms Piper, who has set up a charity to help adults who suffer burns from any cause, said current UK law and sentencing does not reflect the severity of acid attacks. She claimed is is ""all too easy for someone to buy a corrosive substance and throw it... at another person"". Calling on authorities to ""prevent more lives being destroyed"", Ms Piper said: ""Tougher sentencing would surely act as a deterrent to further attacks. ""The issue of penalties for carrying corrosive substances needs to be addressed and restrictions on the sale of corrosive substances need to be looked at seriously."""
2017-07-15,Using acid as a weapon has made headlines after three brutal attacks since April left some victims blinded and disfigured - and calls to toughen the law are growing.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/acid-attacks-calls-to-restrict-sales-after-victims-burned-and-disfigured-10947987,"The most recent case saw five people sprayed in a 90-minute rampage in London - allegedly by two males on a moped who tried to steal other bikes. One teenager has been arrested and one victim is described as having ""life-changing"" injuries. It comes a few weeks after another horrific attack on an aspiring model celebrating her 21st birthday and her 27-year-old cousin. Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar were left with devastating injuries after acid was thrown through their car window in Beckton, east London on 21 June. Mr Muhktar - who was in a coma for two days - said his t-shirt and shorts were ""falling apart"" and his trainers ""melting on his feet"" after the attack. He told Channel 4 News he and his cousin were screaming in pain and he stripped naked to try to stop the burning. ""They're throwing buckets of water over her, buckets of water over me. Somebody came out with a hosepipe..."" He faces skin grafts and plastic surgery to treat the burns to his stomach, neck, ear, arm and back. ""I feel like somebody's ironing me 24/7,"" he said. John Tomlin, 24, faces two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent over the incident. Acid was again used as a weapon in an attack on a packed east London nightclub on Easter Monday. Two people were partially blinded by the attack at the Mangle nightclub in Hackney on 17 April, while other victims were left disfigured. One victim, Sophie Hall, described how ""there was panic... and I just started crying because my face felt as if it was on fire"". ""The acid had run down my cheeks and burnt into my skin. I was hysterical,"" she said. The ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann is one of those charged. Arthur Collins faces 14 counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and one count of throwing an acidic liquid with intent to do GBH to multiple people. TV presenter and author Katie Piper also became well known for her bravery and campaigning after an ex-boyfriend arranged an acid attack on her in 2008. David Lynch and accomplice Stefan Sylvestre both got life sentences. The UK has one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world - and the problem is growing, according to campaign group Acid Survivors Trust International (ACTI). Citing police figures, it says most attacks happen in London and that corrosive substances were used in 458 crimes in the city in 2016, compared to 261 in 2015. The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, told LBC radio: ""I don't want people to think this is happening all over London all the time, it is really not, but we are concerned because the numbers appear to be going up."" In 2013, two young British women were left with horrific burns after an acid attack during a volunteering trip in Zanzibar, east Africa. South Asian countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh also often record acid attacks. Women are usually the victims, left disfigured after rejecting marriage proposals or sexual advances. The crimes often go unreported for fear of reprisals, according to ACTI. Calls to tighten the sale of acid are growing after the recent attacks in the UK and a petition now has more than 360,000 names. Substances such as heavy-duty drain cleaners are relatively easy to buy from hardware stores and online. Campaigners are calling for a licensing system or for the buyer to go through checks and have their details held on a database. Carrying sulphuric acid without justification should also be a criminal offence, according to Labour MP Stephen Timms. Mr Timms, who will lead a debate on the subject on Monday, said: ""I think that carrying acid should in itself be an offence, in the same way that carrying a knife wouldn't have been an offence some years ago."" ""I think there's been a pretty effective change - I think the same change should be made for acid,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick also said she is working with the Home Office on whether a change in the law is needed."

Coweta County Coroner Richard Hawk said Mr Bernecker died following blunt force trauma, ruling that his death was accidental. Filming on the eighth series of the AMC-made show, about people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, has been stopped.

2017-07-15,Philip Hammond is at the centre of a furious row with his own Cabinet colleagues after it was claimed he told them public sector workers were overpaid.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/chancellor-philip-hammond-says-public-sector-workers-overpaid-10950268,"According to The Sunday Times, at last Tuesday's meeting the Chancellor refused to lift the controversial 1% cap on wages for public sector workers because they receive bigger pensions. ""Public sector workers are overpaid when you take into account pensions,"" he is reported to have said, before saying train drivers were ""ludicrously overpaid"". His comments have emerged after senior Tories called for a rethink on the public sector pay cap, claiming it badly damaged the Conservatives in last month's general election. Unions claim more than five million public sector workers have seen their incomes fall in real terms over the last seven years. A Treasury spokesman told Sky News: ""We have chosen to restrain pay to keep more public-sector jobs."" He added: ""The Chancellor was describing to cabinet the 10% public sector pay premium. He didn't say public sector workers were overpaid."" But The Sunday Times quotes a ""Cabinet source"" saying: ""Philip used a fairly inflammatory phrase. He said they were overpaid. ""That caused some general astonishment. His overall tone was that we shouldn't give them more cash because they are overpaid. Later in the meeting both Boris Johnson and the PM said we should not say public sector workers are overpaid."" The row is likely to - and is no doubt intended to - damage Mr Hammond's chances of becoming Prime Minister if Theresa May stands down later this year. Such a potentially explosive claim from inside the Cabinet room suggests ministers plotting ahead of a leadership are now in a state of permanent civil war and that discipline has broken down. The Sunday Times report came after it was reported 24 hours earlier by The Sun that the Chancellor also made sexist comments about women train drivers at the same Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Ministers will come under fresh pressure to lift the pay cap this week when the TUC stages a protest in Westminster. The TUC calculates the real-terms wages of prison officers, paramedics and NHS dieticians are all down more than £3,800 a year compared with seven years ago. Firefighters are down nearly £2,900 and teachers £2,500. Whether or not he used the words ""ludicrously overpaid"", Mr Hammond was no doubt reflecting, however, that train drivers on Southern Rail have voted to strike over pay despite being offered a 23.8% rise over four years to £60,683 for a four-day week."

Ahead of the funeral, people filled the streets of Blackhall as Bradley's coffin was taken to St Joseph's Catholic Church - where he was baptised six years ago. A piper led the coffin, which was in a carriage pulled by white horses draped with his favourite team Sunderland's red and white stripes. Friends and relatives walked behind dressed in superhero costumes and football shirts with 'Bradley' and the number six printed on the back. A spontaneous applause broke out as the cortege passed crowds and some people released balloons. The family said the funeral was open to everyone and that there was no formal dress code. The service was played on speakers outside the church for people who were not able to fit inside. Father Ian Jackson led the service and paid tribute to Bradley, saying he was a ""bright, brave, loving, cheeky monkey"". Bradley was a mascot several times for Sunderland last season, Defoe's former club, as well as for England at Wembley. Sunderland players John O'Shea, Lee Cattermole and Vito Mannone and the club's former manager David Moyes attended the service. Sunderland AFC's chaplain Marc Lyden-Smith spoke at the service, saying Bradley ""has done much more than just touch the hearts of so many football fans"". ""He has been more than a mascot to Sunderland Football Club, he has been an encouragement to many and a loving smile to all of us,"" he added. Bradley, who died from the rare childhood cancer neuroblastoma last week, formed a special bond with Defoe. ""God has you in his arms and I will always carry you in my heart. Sleep tight little one. My best friend,"" the footballer wrote in a tribute to the boy. Ahead of the funeral, the family wrote on Facebook: ""Family and friends have chosen the theme cancer has no colours. So they are wearing football tops it doesn't matter what team or colour."" Bradley died on 7 July at home in the arms of his parents Gemma and Carl."
2017-07-15,The Government helped to secure more than £240m in investment from Toyota with a letter reassuring the carmaker over post-Brexit trade.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/toyota-received-government-assurances-over-240m-investment-10948851,"Toyota announced in March that it would install its new car platform at its plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) has confirmed to the Reuters news agency that the letter exists, but has refused to release it and comment further. A source told Reuters the letter was similar to one sent to fellow Japanese firm Nissan last year, when it decided to build two new models at its Sunderland plant. The letter provoked concerns about the carmaker being offered a ""sweetheart deal"" by the Government. Business Secretary Greg Clark, who has refused to release the Nissan letter, said last year that the assurances offered to Nissan were available to other companies. On the subject of the Toyota letter, the Reuters' source said it contained a number of assurances, but did not say when it was sent. ""They received a similar set of warm words as Nissan on electric vehicles, commitment to further training and to ensure the competitiveness of the UK automotive industry,"" they said. A spokesman for Toyota declined to say whether the firm had received such a letter. He referred to the company's statement in March, which said the Government was providing the company more than £21m for training and research and development. Toyota also said at the time that ""continued tariff-and-barrier free market access ... will be vital for future success"". Reuters submitted Freedom of Information requests to DBEIS asking for documents relating to the Toyota decision to be released. In its response, the department confirmed there was a letter, but refused to release it along with a company briefing note. It said the information was ""both highly commercially sensitive"" and ""would be likely to cause harm to the company's commercial interests if disclosed"". The department did however reveal that Mr Clark had meetings with Toyota officials in September, November and March. The Brexit vote has left a number of the world's biggest car firms worried about the long-term viability of their British operations. Many are pushing the Government for promises to maintain free trade after Brexit takes effect in March 2019. Nissan, Toyota and another Japanese company, Honda, account for around half of British car production. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met Prime Minister Theresa May in April and called for a smooth Brexit in order for Japanese firms to be able to continue to operate."

Under rules introduced in 2010, all appointments that require ministerial approval and have salaries above £142,500 must be agreed by the chief secretary to the Treasury.

2017-07-15,The impact of Brexit has landed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/easyjets-new-airline-is-a-clever-and-expensive-response-to-brexit-10948538,"There will now be three easyJets, all with a capital letter in the wrong place and all located in different places - one in the UK, one in Switzerland and now one in Austria. This new airline, easyJetEurope, will come with its own fleet of planes and its own staff, but make no mistake - it is part of easyJet's UK operations. The planes won't actually spend their lives in Austria, the big decisions will still be made in Luton. This is a clever, and rather expensive, answer to a new problem. For easyJet, this is a £10m insurance policy against the dreaded prospect of having to curtail - hugely - its timetable of flights around Europe. That might seem an unlikely prospect, but it's one that is now giving sleepless nights to plenty within Britain's airline industry. Put simply, there is a huge and complex set of rules that governs the ability of airlines to fly their planes. They govern which countries the airlines can start off from, where they can go to, which passengers they can pick up, where they can drop them off, and then where they can fly to next. They are rules of which most of us have remained oblivious to for years. After all, when you get on a plane you tend to take it for granted that the flight is allowed to go to its destination. But these rules (often abbreviated to ""Open Skies"", even though that bit actually just regulates flights across the Atlantic) are a construct of the European Union. And so, if Brexit happened tomorrow, the UK would drop out of the regulatory framework and, all of a sudden, many of the flights between Britain and Europe would be grounded. Talk to just about anyone in the airline industry and they'll tell you that such a scenario would be so damaging to both sides that it's almost impossible to conceive. British passengers want to come to Europe to do business or go on holiday, and vice versa. Nobody, so the argument runs, benefits if the UK leaves the EU without some kind of refreshed airspace agreement. But the problem is that while it may be almost impossible to imagine that scenario, it's not actually impossible. It could happen. The politics of the EU are Byzantine and unpredictable at the best of times, and the negotiations around Brexit will be long, complicated and full of pockets of European self-interest. There may just be those politicians who rather like the idea of leaving British planes standing idle on the tarmac for a while. For the British airline industry, we can divide the problem into two parts. Firstly, it's flights that start in the UK and fly to a foreign destination - Manchester to Madrid, for example, or Heathrow to New York. Secondly, it's the flights that are run by a UK airline, but which fly entirely outside the UK. Let's say, for example, from Barcelona to Paris or between Berlin and Nice. Both of those routes are offered by easyJet. It is in order to protect these intra-European flights that easyJet has created its new company. By having a new European operation, based in Austria, it can claim an Air Operators Certificate and that, in turn, means it can fly routes within the European Union. This is exactly the same logic as many big banks, especially American banks, are now applying. Like airline companies, they don't know what regulatory framework likes ahead, and nor do they have the luxury of being able to wait and see. In fact, they have legal obligations to manage risks and make contingency plans. In the case of banks, that means adding to their British operations by setting up subsidiaries on the European mainland, allowing them to carry on working across Europe. Easyjet, really, has just done the same thing. This is a tangible example of the Brexit impact, and it won't be the last. But of all the major industries fretting about what could happen over the next couple of years, the aviation business appears to face a distinctly different set of variables. The concept of Open Skies is so embedded into our life that we take it for granted. The mere kernel of an idea that it could disappear, that planes could be grounded and flights to Europe might be suspended, is causing nerves and consternation. For easyJet, perhaps the company most worried about the impact of this disruption, this quick response might look dramatic - but it also looks smart."
2017-07-15,"The response to major incidents such as the Grenfell Tower fire has become a ""postcode lottery"", says the Fire Brigades Union.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/firefighters-call-for-end-to-postcode-lottery-after-grenfell-fire-10949256,"Crew levels and equipment for responding to tower block fires vary greatly across the country, according to research by the union. The ""pre-determined attendance"" (PDA) for a fire - or the number of fire engines that should automatically be sent to a fire or other incident - vary according to location. For example, the FBU said that that the PDA in Bedfordshire is four fire engines and one aerial platform (vehicles with long ladders or platforms needed to deal with fires in high buildings). Hampshire, on the other hand, has a PDA of eight fire engines and an aerial vehicle. The FBU said that, although there are 125 of these ladders and platforms in England, just 33 of them are available all day every day, due to lack of firefighters. :: Firefighters left traumatised by Grenfell Tower fire Matt Wrack, general secretary of the FBU, said in a letter to the Prime Minister that, following the deaths of at least 80 people at Grenfell Tower last month, firefighters had hoped for ""an immediate response"" on the issue from the Government. The fact this has not happened is cause for ""concern and alarm"", the FBU says. Mr Wrack said the findings of the research were ""extremely concerning"". He added: ""In the light of the terrible tragedy at Grenfell Tower, this situation is utterly unacceptable. ""We find it staggering that nothing has been done to address this grossly unjust postcode lottery of resources, and the fact that governments in all parts of the UK appear not to have even considered it is a disgrace. ""They now need to urgently instruct fire services to improve their fire and rescue planning to ensure a full and professional response to such incidents all over the UK. ""Citizens everywhere need to feel safe and confident that those in authority are taking their safety seriously. ""Anything less is, frankly, obscene."""
2017-07-15,"Tony Blair has insisted it is ""absolutely necessary"" that Brexit does not happen because of the ""damage"" the Leave vote is already causing the UK.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170716010310/http://news.sky.com/story/tony-blair-absolutely-necessary-that-brexit-does-not-happen-10949323,"The former prime minister, who campaigned for Remain last year, suggested public opinion is ""moving"" and it is now ""possible"" Britain may not quit the EU. Theresa May triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the legal mechanism for departing the EU, in March this year to put Britain on course for an exit in Spring 2019. But, making a fresh intervention into the debate over Britain's future relationship with the EU, Mr Blair told Sky News' Sophy Ridge: ""I think it's possible now that Brexit doesn't happen. ""I think it's absolutely necessary that it doesn't happen because I think every day is bringing us fresh evidence that it's doing us damage economically, certainly doing us damage politically."" The ex-Labour premier, who was once tipped to become president of the European Council, expressed his belief Brexit voters could be changing their minds due to the performance of the UK economy. ""I think public opinion is moving on it,"" he said. ""This time last year we were the fastest growing economy in the G7, we're now the slowest. ""Our savings ratio is at the lowest for 50 years, the investment community internationally has now gone really negative on us, our currency's down 10-12%, investment in the motor car industry, for example, is down 30%, living standards are stagnating. ""This is causing us real damage, that's beyond doubt."" Mr Blair is the last Labour leader to win a general election and has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's current leadership. But he admitted his predictions of a disastrous result for Labour at the election had been proved ""way off"" by Mr Corbyn's performance, who oversaw the biggest swing to the party since 1945. Despite describing the 8 June vote as being held in ""very unique circumstances"", Mr Blair praised the Labour leadership's ability to enthuse voters. He said: ""I actually think at the beginning of the election campaign, we were going to be routed. ""I think what happened was as much to do with the Tory campaign as our campaign. However, I say this absolutely up front... I've got to pay tribute to his temperament during the campaign. ""To their mobilisation particularly of younger voters, to the way they fought the campaign and they generated a lot of enthusiasm, I completely buy that."" Mr Blair recently wrapped up his controversial business interests and has since founded his own Institute for Global Change. In an essay published on the organisation's website on Saturday, Mr Blair claimed European leaders would be willing to tighten up the free movement of people as a way to avoid Britain leaving the EU. He wrote: ""Rational consideration of the options would sensibly include the option of negotiating for Britain to stay within a Europe itself prepared to reform and meet us half way."" Mr Blair suggested the election of Emmanuel Macron in France ""changes the political dynamics of Europe"" with EU member states now likely to integrate more closely. He added: ""Inevitably, therefore, Europe will comprise an inner and outer circle. Reform is now on Europe's agenda. ""The European leaders, certainly from my discussions, are willing to consider changes to accommodate Britain, including around freedom of movement. Yet this option is excluded."" Responding to Mr Blair's comments, the Tories' junior Brexit minister Robin Walker said: ""The majority of British people voted to leave the EU. ""The majority of MPs, including Tony Blair's own Labour Party, voted to trigger Article 50. ""By calling for the will of the people and Parliament to be overturned, Tony Blair is demonstrating once again that he is out of touch."" Mr Blair's intervention was described as ""loathsome"" by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who told Sky News: ""He's showing people why he is now one of the most disliked living figures in British politics. ""He wants to reverse the result of a democratic referendum. He's making it clear that anything must be done to stop us leaving the EU."" Key Brexit-backer Mr Farage also dismissed the former prime minister's claim the EU could reform in order to allow Britain to remain. ""I don't think anybody today is going to take seriously the idea that the EU is somehow going to change its rules,"" he added. ""Anyway, the referendum wasn't about a rule here or a rule there, it was about supremacy of law - who governs Britain. ""Mr Blair, perhaps you weren't listening, but our answer was we want to govern ourselves."" :: Watch the full interview with Tony Blair on Sophy Ridge on Sunday - tomorrow at 10am"

Terrorists have shown recently that you don't need to build bombs, or buy automatic weapons to kill and maim. You can create carnage by driving a stolen or hired vehicle into crowds. So, too, ordinary criminals, who need to do nothing more complicated than pop into a corner shop or DIY store or empty a car battery to get their hands on a ready-made weapon that will cause real harm. Acid attacks have been used for personal revenge, particularly against women in the Muslim community, where victims will carry their disfigurement as a constant reminder to themselves and others. For years in Britain it was a regular tactic of armed robbers who would squirt, or threaten to squirt, ammonia from a squeezey bottle into the faces of terrified guards. But corrosive fluid of one sort or another has also been used in murders, rapes and gang attacks. :: Acid attacks: Calls to restrict sales after victims burned and disfigured And it's on the increase: last year the number of reported acid attacks in London increased by 74% to 458. Since 2010 there have been 1,800. There was a similar rise in the West Midlands and a national increase of 30%. A teenager told the Sun newspaper this year: ""It's easy to buy and will mess someone up good. I feel safer carrying it to school. ""For a fiver you get drain cleaner, or you can buy ammonia for £3 and keep it in a drinks bottle."" :: Teenager arrested after five moped acid attacks in London in 90 minutes Campaigners have called for such household products to be made weaker or thicker to prevent criminal use. And they recommend that all purchasers should have to register their personal details. None of that will come in time to bring a sudden halt to the current growing trend of acid attacks which, until around 10 years ago, were rare crimes in the UK."

Mr Testino is well-known for his photographs of Princess Diana, but has regularly been the photographer of choice for other members of the Royal family. He said: ""I first photographed the Duchess after her wedding to the Prince on a commission from British Vogue in 2006 and discovered a kind and beautiful person with a wonderful sense of humour. :: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on 'historic' tour ""Doing this latest assignment to celebrate Her Royal Highness's 70th birthday is a true honour."" Camilla turns 70 on Monday and on Saturday night Prince Charles invited family and close friends to a party for his wife on his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire. It is an occasion that has led many newspapers and commentators to reflect on the Duchess' position within the Royal family and how the public now feel about her. Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty Magazine, said: ""The public were doubtful about Camilla and that's one of the reasons their marriage was, for a royal wedding, low-key. ""What she did was very gently introduce herself into royal life, so to start with she did very few engagements, she was just at Prince Charles' side so people could see she was supportive of him. ""She always did charity work but it was very low profile, and then she took on some perhaps less glamorous charities, and very, very slowly she just was herself and people saw what a nice lady she is."" In the past decade Camilla has become an important part of the upper tier of the Royal family - she carries out Royal duties on behalf of the Queen and was also made a privy councillor by her mother-in-law. Her charity work focuses on issues such as literacy, animal welfare and osteoporosis, but more striking is her involvement with rape crisis and domestic violence charities and the support she has given to campaigns against human trafficking and female genital mutilation."

Devon and Cornwall Police said they believe she ""had taken a new psychoactive substance, more commonly referred to as 'legal highs', and had suffered adverse reaction"". Police believe the drug was illegal. The phrase ""legal high"" is still commonly used to refer to substances which may have been legal before the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 became law last year. Two other teenage girls were also taken to Torbay District Hospital as a precaution and have since been discharged. Officers want to speak to anyone with information about the incident, as well as anyone who was in the park in the early hours of Saturday. The teenager's family have been informed of her death while police are still at Bakers Park as they conduct initial enquiries. The Government this month unveiled a new strategy to target psychoactive substances, which were formerly known as ""legal highs"" before a blanket UK-wide ban came into force in May last year. Offenders who break the new laws face up to seven years in prison. In 2015, more than 100 deaths in the UK were linked to ""legal highs""."
2017-07-16,The Jurassic coastline around the East Coast resort of Scarborough is undeniably beautiful.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170717014417/http://news.sky.com/story/ocean-rescue-fears-of-plastic-pollution-washing-in-on-every-tide-10950276,"In many places, the cliffs of mudstone, limestone and sandstones make the shoreline inaccessible to humans. But sadly not to their rubbish. It's perhaps not surprising that there is litter here. Not when it's estimated that between 4.8 million and 12.7 million tons of plastic end up in the world's oceans every year. Plastic makes up 95% of the rubbish in our seas, mainly in the form of bags, food and drink containers, and fishing equipment; from past studies it is thought that as many as 90% of the world's seabirds have plastic in their stomachs. There are several seal colonies along the coast, and it was during the return of a rescued animal that RSPCA officers noticed the levels of litter. So they have now launched 'Operation Sweeping Tides' to try to tackle the issue. They're working in partnership with Scarborough Council, the local Sea Life Centre, and dozens of volunteers to clean up the coastline. It's a task that would be virtually impossible without the charity's rescue boats, used to collect the rubbish gathered by the volunteers from secluded coves and beaches. ""This really is a growing problem,"" says the RSPCA's Geoff Edmond. ""There is lots of rubbish and debris out there, we need to get it removed. And it's washing in, potentially on every tide."" The grey and common seal colonies at places like Ravenscar, Cayton and Boggle Hole have been recovering well since being decimated by viruses in the early 2000s. To see that progress set back by littering, would be a bitter blow. Todd German, who works with rescued seals at Scarborough's Sea Life Centre, says: ""The plastic really needs to be taken away, not just for the aesthetics, but because it can so often end up in the food chain. ""And not just for the animals. Many of the micro plastics that get ingested by marine animals and sea birds can easily end up on our plates too."" The volunteers picking up the litter were from all social groups and all ages. Some were families teaching their children about their environmental responsibilities. Others, like Pete Shepherd, have taken a more committed approach. ""We first noticed a problem when we saw a paraffin wax leak a few months ago,"" Mr Shepherd says. ""So we started cleaning up whenever we could, and we've become a group called the 'Clean Coast Warriors'. We're now hoping to run regular beach cleaning days organised through our Facebook page."" Globally, the skip full of bottles, cans, fishing gear and the rest which the volunteers have collected is a minuscule amount. But for the seabirds and seals along this beautiful stretch of the East Coast, it could mean the difference between life, and a prolonged and painful death. Sky News launched its Sky Ocean Rescue campaign earlier this year aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the world's seas. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"

Sky News has spoken to the two key diplomats who will guide the royal couple through their week-long trip; Sir Sebastian Wood, the British ambassador to Germany, and Jonathan Knott, Britain's man in Poland. The visit comes as the next round of Brexit negotiations get underway in Brussels. Speaking in Warsaw at the start of the tour, Jonathan Knott told Sky News: ""One of the features as you know of the royal family is that they are apolitical, they are above politics, so this is really about the connection between peoples, between organisations. ""That's one of the reasons why we've made sure that they talk both about Poland's past, but also that they see some of the potential for collaboration in future."" When asked if the Royal couple would come across anyone talking about the topics of migration and citizens rights, Mr Knott said: ""I wouldn't say they were off the table but I don't think that's the kind of visit that we're on. ""This isn't a ministerial visit, this isn't a prime ministerial visit, but what I think the visit is really going to do is accelerate that process of deepening our relationships and making sure that as we go through the process of leaving the EU our relationship doesn't weaken - actually it gets stronger."" On Wednesday the Royal party will head to Germany for three days. Speaking in the Adlon Hotel in Berlin, in the suite where the Queen stayed during her 2015 visit, Sir Sebastian said: ""I think a trip like this is significant whatever the context. ""In a way this is historic, the first time that Prince William comes with his family on an official visit, and it's the beginning of what I hope will be a long standing relationship between them and Germany."" On the subject of how important William and Kate are as Brexit ambassadors, he said: ""The Royal family are important ambassadors full stop for the UK and when they make a big visit like this it makes a big diplomatic contribution."" But when asked if people were being told not to mention Brexit he added: ""Well the context is what it is, but the focus will be on the future of the relationship between our countries."" Since the start of the year Europe has been a key focus for tours carried out by members of the Royal family. All visits are conducted on behalf of the Queen at the request of the Government and the Foreign Office. On the issues of citizens rights and future trade deals Poland and Germany are two crucial countries involved in the ongoing Brexit negotiations. Prince George and Princess Charlotte will also fly out with their parents."

2017-07-16,"Jewish people in Britain are being ""betrayed"" by police and prosecutors who are failing to clamp down on anti-Semitic crimes, it is claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170717014417/http://news.sky.com/story/police-failing-to-protect-jews-as-anti-semitic-crimes-rise-10950275,"Suspected hate offences against them rose by almost 15% in 2016 compared with a year before, reaching the worst level on record, research suggests. There are warnings that British Jews have to endure ""intolerable"" levels which have become the ""new normality"". Campaigners say 1,078 offences were recorded by police forces in the UK last year, compared to 938 in 2015 and 746 in 2014. But the number of charges fell by 30.5% last year, with alleged perpetrators charged in fewer than a tenth of cases, they add. Charges were brought in 83 cases - or 8.3% of offences recorded, said a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, following Freedom of Information requests. Police recorded 105 violent offences against Jews in 2016 - down by 44% compared to 2015. The campaign said it believed 15 alleged anti-Semitic crimes were prosecuted last year, following a review of its own and other charities' data, as well as press reports. Gideon Falter, chairman of the campaign, said: ""The failure of police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service to protect British Jews is a betrayal. ""Britain has the political will to fight anti-Semitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. ""There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change."" But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it does not recognise the figures and it is wrong to claim it does not take prosecuting anti-Semitic crime seriously. A CPS spokesman said: ""Last year we prosecuted more hate crimes than ever before - more than 15,000 cases."" The report recommends training and guidance on anti-Semitic hate crime for officers and prosecutors and called for watchdogs to examine police forces' responses to the offences. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""We are working together to tackle anti-Semitic hate crime in all its forms and using the full force of the law to protect every person in the UK."" Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said: ""The police service is committed to tackling all forms of intolerance and hate-motivated crime, but to do so we need all victims or witnesses to come forward and report these incidents to us."""
2017-07-16,Philip Hammond has appeared to accuse Cabinet colleagues of briefing against him due to their unhappiness with his Brexit position.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170717014417/http://news.sky.com/story/philip-hammond-suggests-hard-brexiteers-are-briefing-against-him-10950428,"Deep divisions in the heart of Government were exposed overnight when the Chancellor was accused by five sources in The Sunday Times of telling Cabinet colleagues that public sector workers are ""overpaid"". Mr Hammond would not deny he used that word when questioned on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""I'm not going to say what was or wasn't said at a Cabinet meeting and it's easy to quote a phrase out of context,"" he said. But he said the leaked comments were the result of the ""silly summer season"" and told his fellow ministers it would be ""helpful"" if they ""focused on the job in hand"". Appearing to allege he is being targeted, Mr Hammond, who backed Remain, claimed ""some of the noise"" around the Tory party has been ""generated by people who are not happy"" with his insistence that Brexit must be focused on ""protecting our economy"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis, both Leave supporters, are at the centre of reports that senior Tories are positioning themselves to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister. Mr Hammond said he would ""certainly hope"" there is no ongoing leadership contest at the top of Government"", adding: ""If there is I'm no part of it."" On public sector pay, the Chancellor described it as a ""simple fact"" that public sector workers are paid 10% more than private sector workers. He has come under pressure to ditch the 1% cap on annual public sector pay rises following the General Election result, amid internal Government feuding on the issue. The Chancellor described how public sector pay ""raced ahead"" of private sector wages following the 2008/09 financial crash, with both sets of workers now paid ""about the same level"". ""But when you take into account the very generous contributions public sector employers have to pay in for their workers' pensions, their very generous pensions, they are still about 10% ahead,"" he added. Despite the ""premium"" public sector workers enjoy compared with private sector employees, Mr Hammond insisted he was sympathetic to ""all the issues that public sector workers are facing"". He said: ""You can't eat your pension, you can't feed your kids with your pension contribution."" Mr Hammond denied another report he had told his Cabinet colleagues that driving trains is now so easy that ""even a woman can do it"". He said: ""No, I didn't and I wouldn't say anything like that. I don't think like that, I wouldn't make a remark like that."" Former Tory chancellor Lord Lamont warned the Cabinet would ""collapse in chaos if there isn't more collective unity"". He told Sky News: ""These discussions ought to be in private and briefing on this scale I think is actually... pretty unprecedented. ""It's very dangerous - I think Cabinet ministers are playing with fire."" The peer said it was ""important the Prime Minister and the Chancellor support each other"". Ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith also criticised the leaks, claiming it is ""quite wrong"" for senior ministers to be revealing the contents of Cabinet discussions. He told Sky News: ""The old story about a leak is... plug it. And the best way to plug it is to shut up and not go talking outside. ""Cabinet was meant to be private process and it's quite wrong if Cabinet ministers are leaking stuff out. I know most of my colleagues and backbenchers do not want this to continue. ""There will be no leadership contest - they do not want one. We have a job to do, Theresa May has a job to do, you must remember Theresa May won the last election."""
2017-07-16,"An ex-Russian ""spy"" has admitted he attended a controversial meeting with Donald Trump's son in 2016.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170717014417/http://news.sky.com/story/russian-lobbyist-admits-meeting-donald-trump-jr-in-2016-10948588,"Rinat Akhmetshin, named in US Senate documents as a former ""Soviet counter-intelligence officer"", confirmed he was present at the discussion Mr Trump Jr had with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. He claimed the meeting was billed as part of a Russian government effort to help Mr Trump during last year's US presidential election campaign. The lobbyist said Mr Trump Jr was disappointed when he asked for evidence of illicit money flowing to the rival Democratic National Committee and Ms Veselnitskaya could not provide it. Mr Akhmetshin said the group's conversation was ""not substantive"" and he ""actually expected more serious"" discussion. :: US divided over Donald Trump links to Russia The latest revelation adds another shift to the tale that has sparked questions over the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Mr Trump Jr did not disclose Mr Akhmetshin's presence in statements and emails he released earlier this week about the meeting. The correspondence showed Mr Trump Jr was told Russian figures wanted to meet to pass on negative information about Democrat Hilary Clinton. Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and current White House senior adviser, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the discussion. :: Why is President Trump so soft on Russia? The Russian government has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the June 2016 meeting. Asked on Friday about Mr Akhmetshin, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""We don't know anything about this person."" :: Russia emails could determine Trump's fate Ms Veselnitskaya said she was not working for Russian authorities, but she told The Wall Street Journal that she was meeting with Russian authorities regularly. She said she shared information about a US-born fund manager who lobbied for passage of the Magnitsky Act with the Russian prosecutor generals office, including with Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, a top official appointed by the Kremlin, the Journal said. But Ms Veselnitskaya was described by a US businessman who will give testimony to a Senate committee against her as a ""well-resourced player"". William Brodwer told Sky News: ""She is paid by and works for a man named Denis Katsyv. Mr Katsyv was the governor of the Moscow region, which is the size of France. ""He's currently the vice-president of Russian Railways, which is probably the second most important Russian government company after [energy firm] Gasprom. ""He is a senior member of the Putin regime. It's just not credible to say she's not connected to the government."" Mr Browder added that Mr Akhmetshin was effectively Ms Veselnitskaya's ""guide through the political corridors of power in Washington"". ""There is no such thing as being a former member of Russian intelligence,"" he said. ""I don't believe what the Russians say and given the changing stories from the US side it's hard to believe what they say as well."" Who is Rinat Akhmetshin? Details on Mr Akhmetshin's identity come mostly from a letter sent earlier this year from the US Senate's Judiciary Committee chairman to the head of Homeland Security. It says the lobbyist is Russian-born, but moved to the US in the 1990s and became an American citizen in 2009. Mr Akhmetshin is described as a former ""Soviet counter-intelligence officer"", who worked for the GRU - Russian foreign military intelligence. The letter cites reports that he ""specialises in 'active campaign measures', ie subversive political influence operations often involving disinformation and propaganda"". It says Mr Akhmetshin denied the allegations, despite his ""admission to the press that he had been a Russian intelligence officer, in response to a different press inquiry"". Speaking after his presence at the 2016 meeting emerged, Mr Akhmetshin claimed he was drafted to serve in the Soviet Army from 1986 to 1988 but was not trained in any spy tradecraft."

He will then meet with doctors from the hospital and other medical experts to discuss his condition. The meeting of specialists is the latest stage of a court battle over the best course of action for Charlie, who suffers from a rare genetic condition and has brain damage. :: What next for Charlie Gard case? It will be attended by Charlie's mother, Connie Yates, after a judge ruled she could be present for the gathering. Ms Yates and Charlie's father, Chris Gard, want to be allowed to take their son to New York to undergo a trial therapy overseen by Dr Hirano. But specialists at Great Ormond Street say the therapy is experimental and will not help Charlie. They do not believe that Charlie has any chance of surviving his critical illness and that life-support treatment for the child should stop. Dr Hirano has said he believes there is now a better chance the treatment would produce a meaningful improvement than there was when he gave evidence three months earlier. The couple, who are in their 30s and come from Bedfont, west London, want Mr Justice Francis to reopen the case in light of the new evidence. Preliminary hearings were held at the Family Division of the High Court in London over the last week. More are scheduled for later this month following this week's gathering of medical experts. In April a judge ruled in favour of Great Ormond Street, saying Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. :: Timeline: Parents' battle to save Charlie Gard The parents have previously lost battles against the hospital in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in London over Charlie's treatment. The European Court of Human Rights also decided not to intervene in the case. Alasdair Seton-Marsden, who represents Charlie Gard's family to the press, has said baby Charlie has become ""a prisoner of the state"". He argued that if the couple were rich instead of ""ordinary people"" their child would be free to receive treatment in the US."

""One of the things with the wall is you need transparency,"" he told journalists on a flight to Pairs. ""You have to be able to see through it. ""So it could be a steel wall with openings, but you have to have openings because you have to see what's on the other wide of the wall. ""And I'll give you an example. As horrible as it sounds, when they throw large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don't see them. ""They hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It's over. ""As crazy as that sounds, you need transparency through that wall. But we have some incredible designs."" The comments were made on Thursday to reporters, while Mr Trump was travelling on Air Force One to a state visit in France. They came to light hours later, only after journalists realised he was serious and wanted them reported. Andres Rozental, Mexico's former deputy foreign minister and ambassador to the UK, told Sky News the idea was ""the most ridiculous thing I have heard in many, many years"". He added: ""It just doesn't make any sense. It's not true."" Mr Rozental estimated there was a ""less than 20% chance that this wall - as he calls it - will ever be built"". He cited tough opposition in the US congress and among communities clustered along the country's border with Mexico as Mr Trump's biggest challenges. The wall was one of Mr Trump's central promises of his 2016 presidential campaign."

""I am clear that life sentences must not be reserved for acid attack survivors,"" she wrote in The Sunday Times. Plans to ensure acid and other corrosive substances can be classed as dangerous weapons are among the changes included in the shake-up. The Government will also aim to put in place measures which restrict the sale of such substances by retailers. The move follows a recent spate of high-profile incidents, including five assaults that were linked in London on Thursday. The UK has one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world and a petition calling for sales of acid to be restricted now has more than 432,000 names. The Home Office will work with police and the Ministry of Justice to assess whether powers available to the courts, including sentencing, are sufficient. Possession of acid or other corrosive substances with the intention to do harm can already be treated as possession of an offensive weapon under the Prevention of Crime Act, which carries a four-year maximum penalty. Crown Prosecution Service's guidance to prosecutors will now be reviewed to ensure it makes clear that acid and other corrosive substances can be classed as dangerous weapons, and what is required to prove intent. The Poisons Act 1972 will be assessed to consider if it should cover more harmful substances, while retailers will be asked to agree to measures to restrict sales of acids and other corrosive substances. New guidance will also be issued to police on preventing attacks, searching potential attackers for harmful substances and responding to victims at the scene. More than 400 acid or corrosive substance attacks were carried out in the six months up to April 2017, according to figures from 39 forces in England and Wales. Bleach, ammonia and acid were the most commonly used substances, the Home Office said. In an earlier statement, Ms Rudd said: ""Acid attacks are horrific crimes which have a devastating effect on victims, both physically and emotionally. ""It is vital that we do everything we can to prevent these sickening attacks happening in the first place. ""We must also ensure that the police and other emergency services are able to respond as effectively as possible, that sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences and victims are given the immediate support they need."" Sarah Newton, minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, will outline the Government's strategy in the Commons on Monday."

Ms Piper, 33, described how survivors of acid attacks are handed a ""life sentence"" through the trauma of their ordeal. She published her plea for increased legislation in the wake of five acid attacks, believed to be linked, which took place within 90 minutes of each other in north and east London on Thursday night. It comes just a few weeks after aspiring model Resham Khan and her cousin Jameel Muhktar in east London were attacked while celebrating her 21st birthday. There was another acid attack in east London on Easter Monday, leaving two people at a nightclub partially blinded and others injured. The UK has one of the highest rates of acid attacks in the world, with the crimes feared to be on the rise. :: Acid attacks: Calls to restrict sales Ms Piper was left partially blind and with severe, permanent scarring when a former boyfriend arranged for acid to be thrown in her face in 2008. Writing in the Scars, Burns and Healing journal, Ms Piper described how she has undergone 250 operations and hours of psychological therapy following the assault, which left her contemplating suicide. She wrote: ""I will continue to need operations and therapy for life. For acid attack survivors, the aftermath is a life sentence."" Urging the Government to impose harsher penalties on attackers who use corrosive substances, Ms Piper said: ""Lives can be destroyed in moments. ""Survivors of such attacks often have to live with the immediate fear that their attackers may still be at large, and in the longer term - even if the attackers are caught and sentenced - may be released to potentially live alongside them after serving a minimum term. ""I meet many inspiring individuals who have worked hard to rebuild their lives after an attack; however, it can be hard to stay motivated when the justice system does not always reflect the severity of these crimes."" Ms Piper, who has set up a charity to help adults who suffer burns from any cause, said current UK law and sentencing does not reflect the severity of acid attacks. She claimed is is ""all too easy for someone to buy a corrosive substance and throw it... at another person"". Calling on authorities to ""prevent more lives being destroyed"", Ms Piper said: ""Tougher sentencing would surely act as a deterrent to further attacks. ""The issue of penalties for carrying corrosive substances needs to be addressed and restrictions on the sale of corrosive substances need to be looked at seriously."""

For example, the FBU said that that the PDA in Bedfordshire is four fire engines and one aerial platform (vehicles with long ladders or platforms needed to deal with fires in high buildings). Hampshire, on the other hand, has a PDA of eight fire engines and an aerial vehicle. The FBU said that, although there are 125 of these ladders and platforms in England, just 33 of them are available all day every day, due to lack of firefighters. :: Firefighters left traumatised by Grenfell Tower fire Matt Wrack, general secretary of the FBU, said in a letter to the Prime Minister that, following the deaths of at least 80 people at Grenfell Tower last month, firefighters had hoped for ""an immediate response"" on the issue from the Government. The fact this has not happened is cause for ""concern and alarm"", the FBU says. Mr Wrack said the findings of the research were ""extremely concerning"".

A man in his 20s was arrested at the scene, police said. The motive for the attack is not yet known. The two women who died were German, security officials said, while the four others hurt included citizens of Ukraine and the Czech Republic. Hurghada is one of Egypt's most popular beach resorts, particularly with Ukrainians and other European tourists. Security has been tightened in tourist resorts around the country as the industry is a major revenue stream for Egypt. The attack came after five police officers were shot dead in Cairo's twin city of Giza when suspected Islamic militants opened fire on their vehicle early on Friday morning. In January 2016, three tourists in Hurghada were wounded in a stabbing attack by two assailants with apparent Islamic State group sympathies."

A piper led the coffin, which was in a carriage pulled by white horses draped with his favourite team Sunderland's red and white stripes. Friends and relatives walked behind dressed in superhero costumes and football shirts with 'Bradley' and the number six printed on the back. A spontaneous applause broke out as the cortege passed crowds and some people released balloons. The family said the funeral was open to everyone and that there was no formal dress code. The service was played on speakers outside the church for people who were not able to fit inside. Father Ian Jackson led the service and paid tribute to Bradley, saying he was a ""bright, brave, loving, cheeky monkey"". Bradley was a mascot several times for Sunderland last season, Defoe's former club, as well as for England at Wembley. Sunderland players John O'Shea, Lee Cattermole and Vito Mannone and the club's former manager David Moyes attended the service. Sunderland AFC's chaplain Marc Lyden-Smith spoke at the service, saying Bradley ""has done much more than just touch the hearts of so many football fans"". ""He has been more than a mascot to Sunderland Football Club, he has been an encouragement to many and a loving smile to all of us,"" he added. Bradley, who died from the rare childhood cancer neuroblastoma last week, formed a special bond with Defoe. ""God has you in his arms and I will always carry you in my heart. Sleep tight little one.

Mr McDonnell first expressed his view that the disaster was ""murder"" during a debate at Glastonbury in June. When asked if he regretted his words, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""No, I don't regret that. I was extremely angry with what went on. I'm a west London MP, this site is not far from me. ""Political decisions were made which resulted in the deaths of these people. That's a scandal."" When pressed on the use of the word ""murder"", Mr McDonnell said: ""There's a long history in this country of the concept of social murder where decisions are made with no regard to consequences of that, and as a result of that people have suffered. ""That's what's happened here, and I'm angry."" He added: ""I believe social murder has occurred in this incidence and I believe people should be accountable."" The concept of 'social murder' was made popular by German philosopher Friedrich Engels, who founded Marxist theory with Karl Marx in the 19th century. Elaborating on who exactly the ""murderers"" were, Mr McDonnell, said: ""I think there's been a consequence of political decisions over years that have not addressed the housing crisis that we've had, that have cut back on local government so proper inspections have not been made. ""Eleven-thousand firefighter jobs have been cut as well - even the investment in aerial ladders - and things like that in our country."" When asked if he meant that the politicians who oversaw the cuts were murderers, he replied: ""I believe politicians have to be held to account. I remain angry at how many people have lost their lives as a result of political decisions made over years.""

2017-07-16,The impact of Brexit has landed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170717014417/http://news.sky.com/story/easyjets-new-airline-is-a-clever-and-expensive-response-to-brexit-10948538,"There will now be three easyJets, all with a capital letter in the wrong place and all located in different places - one in the UK, one in Switzerland and now one in Austria. This new airline, easyJetEurope, will come with its own fleet of planes and its own staff, but make no mistake - it is part of easyJet's UK operations. The planes won't actually spend their lives in Austria, the big decisions will still be made in Luton. This is a clever, and rather expensive, answer to a new problem. For easyJet, this is a £10m insurance policy against the dreaded prospect of having to curtail - hugely - its timetable of flights around Europe. That might seem an unlikely prospect, but it's one that is now giving sleepless nights to plenty within Britain's airline industry. Put simply, there is a huge and complex set of rules that governs the ability of airlines to fly their planes. They govern which countries the airlines can start off from, where they can go to, which passengers they can pick up, where they can drop them off, and then where they can fly to next. They are rules of which most of us have remained oblivious to for years. After all, when you get on a plane you tend to take it for granted that the flight is allowed to go to its destination. But these rules (often abbreviated to ""Open Skies"", even though that bit actually just regulates flights across the Atlantic) are a construct of the European Union. And so, if Brexit happened tomorrow, the UK would drop out of the regulatory framework and, all of a sudden, many of the flights between Britain and Europe would be grounded. Talk to just about anyone in the airline industry and they'll tell you that such a scenario would be so damaging to both sides that it's almost impossible to conceive. British passengers want to come to Europe to do business or go on holiday, and vice versa. Nobody, so the argument runs, benefits if the UK leaves the EU without some kind of refreshed airspace agreement. But the problem is that while it may be almost impossible to imagine that scenario, it's not actually impossible. It could happen. The politics of the EU are Byzantine and unpredictable at the best of times, and the negotiations around Brexit will be long, complicated and full of pockets of European self-interest. There may just be those politicians who rather like the idea of leaving British planes standing idle on the tarmac for a while. For the British airline industry, we can divide the problem into two parts. Firstly, it's flights that start in the UK and fly to a foreign destination - Manchester to Madrid, for example, or Heathrow to New York. Secondly, it's the flights that are run by a UK airline, but which fly entirely outside the UK. Let's say, for example, from Barcelona to Paris or between Berlin and Nice. Both of those routes are offered by easyJet. It is in order to protect these intra-European flights that easyJet has created its new company. By having a new European operation, based in Austria, it can claim an Air Operators Certificate and that, in turn, means it can fly routes within the European Union. This is exactly the same logic as many big banks, especially American banks, are now applying. Like airline companies, they don't know what regulatory framework likes ahead, and nor do they have the luxury of being able to wait and see. In fact, they have legal obligations to manage risks and make contingency plans. In the case of banks, that means adding to their British operations by setting up subsidiaries on the European mainland, allowing them to carry on working across Europe. Easyjet, really, has just done the same thing. This is a tangible example of the Brexit impact, and it won't be the last. But of all the major industries fretting about what could happen over the next couple of years, the aviation business appears to face a distinctly different set of variables. The concept of Open Skies is so embedded into our life that we take it for granted. The mere kernel of an idea that it could disappear, that planes could be grounded and flights to Europe might be suspended, is causing nerves and consternation. For easyJet, perhaps the company most worried about the impact of this disruption, this quick response might look dramatic - but it also looks smart."
2017-07-16,Connie Yates and Chris Gard have achieved more for their critically ill son in the past week than they have during the past five months of their legal battle with Great Ormond Street Hospital.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170717014417/http://news.sky.com/story/what-comes-next-in-the-case-of-critically-ill-baby-charlie-gard-10948886,"A meeting of clinical experts will be held at the hospital early next week, when they will be asked a series of questions about Charlie Gard's condition. The exact wording has not yet been decided, but they will be questions like: does Charlie have brain damage? Is it irreversible? And so on. Grant Armstrong, the barrister who is acting, unpaid, for Charlie's parents, has persuaded the High Court that Ms Yates should be allowed to attend the meeting. There will be an independent chair who will allow her to make comments while ensuring she does not interrupt the experts' discussion. :: Developments at the High Court on Friday Another success for the parents is that the meeting will be attended by Dr Michio Hirano, professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York. :: The US doctor parents hope can save Charlie At a hearing on Thursday, he told the court by video link that there was now a better chance than he previously thought when he gave evidence three months earlier that a new therapy could strengthen Charlie's muscles. At that stage, he could not be identified. Dr Hirano withdrew his request for anonymity when he heard it would be opposed by the Press Association news agency and other reporters. :: Timeline: Parents' battle to save Charlie Gard The clinicians' meeting will be recorded and a transcript will be sent to the judge, Mr Justice Francis. He is planning to hold a further hearing on July 24 and 25, when he will assess the medical evidence and decide whether there has been any change since his last ruling on April 11, when he decided it was in Charlie's best interests not to have nucleoside therapy and for his doctors to provide him with palliative care only. That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. What Charlie's parents are now hoping is that the evidence given by Dr Hirano, in discussion with the other experts, will be enough to persuade the judge that it is now in Charlie's best interests to have the therapy being offered. That treatment would presumably mean transferring Charlie to a hospital in New York. Again, the court would have to consider whether this would be in his best interests. If everything goes according to plan, Mr Justice Francis hopes to give his ruling at the end of the hearing on 25 July."
2017-07-16,Satellite technology is being developed to track down and stop a crime wave that is costing the UK an estimated £1bn a year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170717014417/http://news.sky.com/story/new-satellite-technology-may-mean-fly-tipping-days-are-numbered-10949246,"Illegal dumping of waste has been called the new narcotics, with profits said to rival that of the drugs trade. Now satellite imaging is so advanced that vast areas of the countryside, hidden from ground view and therefore perfect for fly tipping, can be scanned in detail; and illegal dumps, even if they are buried, can be discovered. Retired geography professor Ray Harris is one of those behind the technique. He said: ""It doesn't tell us where every single waste site is, it just narrows down the possibilities. ""We're looking for a needle in a haystack but we're trying to get rid of the haystack and that reveals where the needle might be."" Mr Harris believes that, as word spreads among the fly tippers, they will become more wary. ""The more this technology is used the greater the deterrent will be for criminals. ""They'll think: 'Oh I can't just hide this big waste pile in my back garden because I've got to look upwards and think I'm going to be surveyed from the sky'."" Dumping waste legally is not cheap - a single skip can cost you hundreds of pounds to get rid of and, for criminal gangs with access to land, that presents the potential to make big money by undercutting legitimate businesses. Jack Goodman, who runs a waste site in east London, said disposing of the rubbish deposited there every year costs his business around £250,000. The criminals are so brazen they even rip off legal dumps, he added. ""We've had incidences where they come in (and said) 'yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine we'll use the weigh bridge'. ""They tip and just drive out, speed off."" To add insult to injury, his business then has to pay to dispose of the criminals' waste. ""We're out of pocket because they've tipped and literally sped off. ""We try to stop them but you can't jump in front of the lorry so there's not really much you can do."" But illegal tipping is not just about money - it ruins lives as well. Jan Watkins from Orpington lives near to what used to be a legitimate dump. It broke its licence and allowed too much waste to be disposed of, prompting the council to close it. The council is still in the process of clearing the site but have had to put the clean-up on hold because toxic material has been discovered in the waste. ""It was taller than the trees,"" Mrs Watkins said of the waste. ""There was a telephone pole that was 50 feet high and the rubbish was almost as high as that. ""It wasn't just an eyesore, at its peak the flies were unbelievable, the smells were absolutely dreadful. ""You couldn't open the doors and windows in the summer."" If the satellite, Spy In The Sky, does what its developers and the Environment Agency hopes then illegal tipping may be looking less profitable."
2017-07-16,"When I met Tara Quigley at her home, she was recovering after undergoing her 15th operation to repair damage to her skin following an acid attack more than four years ago.

Her face has healed well - the scarring on her neck is taking longer to fix. She told me about the moment of the attack. ""I heard a random knock at my door and a young boy was there. He asked if Michelle lived at the address. I told him no one under that name lived there, so he left. ""He came back about five minutes later and as soon as I opened my front door he just threw a bottle of acid at me, didn't say a word and just ran off."" :: Acid attack offenders 'could face life sentences' Just what do you do when acid has been poured over your head and body? Tara said: ""Almost straight away I knew it was acid because my skin was bubbling on my chest and the pain was excruciating. I just knew I had to get to water. ""I ran to my kitchen, washed my face and then my sister took me upstairs - luckily she had just had a bath - and I plunged myself into her bath and straight away we called the ambulance."" Talking to Tara, you get a sense of just how damaging even the smallest amount of acid can be. One of her dogs, who rushed to the door with her, was blinded after being splashed with acid during the attack. Part of the radiator by the front door and clothes hanging nearby melted. The boy found guilty of the attack - who was 15 years old at the time - is still in prison. The attack took just seconds, but as well the physical scars, Tara has been left with mental health problems and has received counselling. ""I don't go out anymore, I kind of stay at home,"" she said. ""The anxiety when I do go out is so overwhelming that generally I get 10 minutes down the road and I just come home because I just can't handle it, to be honest. I constantly look over my shoulder. ""I cry over it. I have nightmares. I think about it every time I look in the mirror and see my neck. My family were affected by it, mentally. Every time there's a new case on the news, it kind of brings it all back to me. You just relive it, constantly."" Tara welcomes news that the Government is reviewing sentencing for acid attacks and rules surrounding the purchase of such dangerous products. She told Sky News: ""I believe it should carry a life sentence because of the effect it has on the victims. With this (her injuries) it's such a slow, slow road to recovery. ""The constant operations, the constant reliving of going back to the hospitals - their lives should be affected as much as ours are.""Because something has to be done about it. It's gone way to far now."""

There is speculation she could face a Tory leadership battle and many commentators do not think she will take the party into another general election due in 2022. :: Tony Blair must have the thickest skin in politics Former PM Mr Blair claimed she was in a precarious position and was under threat from colleagues. He told Sky's Sophy Ridge it was a ""very unsatisfactory situation"" that Mrs May was surrounded by people ""waiting for the moment they decide to throw her off the ledge"". He added: ""I think there is something a little unseemly about all of it really."" His comments come days after Mrs May said she shed a ""little tear"" when she saw the exit poll on election night that forecast her election gamble would not pay off. Mr Blair said he felt sorry for her because ""she's somebody who's got the best interest of the country at heart"" but he ""profoundly disagrees with her about Brexit"". He does not want the UK to leave the European Union, despite a majority of voters backing a divorce from the bloc. However, Mrs May is committed to delivering ""the will of the people"" by taking the country out of the EU. Mr Blair said: ""I understand why she thinks 'the people have spoken, it's my job to deliver that verdict'. ""But I would like to see more leadership and less followship."" The former Labour leader also expressed fears about the impact of social media on UK politics. He said: ""There's a huge issue today in how information is traded and exchanged in a democracy. ""The interaction of conventional media - that's become fragmented, much more partisan - with social media is creating part of this polarisation of politics.

2017-07-16,A second teenager has been arrested by police investigating five linked acid attacks in London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170717014417/http://news.sky.com/story/police-investigate-four-linked-acid-attacks-in-east-london-10947918,"A 15-year-old was arrested on Friday morning on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and robbery following the ""hideous"" attacks on Thursday night. A 16-year-old was already being held on suspicion of the same offences after being identified near the scene of the attacks by CCTV. Both are being held in custody at a north London police station and Scotland Yard said they are treating the attacks, which took place within 90 minutes, as linked. All five victims were taken to hospital, with one described as having life-changing injuries. The assaults involved a pair on a moped attacking other moped riders and allegedly stealing two bikes. The Metropolitan Police dismissed rumours all the victims were food delivery drivers set up in advance of the attacks. Those attacked were described as being ""from a variety of backgrounds"", while officers urged potential witnesses to come forward with information and photos and videos they may have recorded. Chief Inspector Ben Clark, from Hackney Borough, said: ""These are hideous offences and must have been very frightening for all of the victims. ""Of late we have seen more attacks using corrosive substances in London. ""I would urge businesses and parents to challenge those who they think may be trying to obtain or carry these substances as this could help prevent serious offences and life changing injuries being caused."" At the start of the rampage, at 10.25pm, a 32-year-old man was approached as he rode towards the Hackney Road junction with Queensbridge Road. The two attackers tossed a corrosive substance in his face before one jumped on his moped and rode away. Police dowsed the victim with large bottles of water, said witness Sarah Cobbold. The man went to an east London hospital but his injuries are not being treated as life-threatening or life-changing. Twenty minutes later, at around 10.50pm, a 44-year-old man was sprayed with liquid on the Upper Street junction with Highbury Corner, Islington. The victim was taken to a hospital in north London, but there is not yet an update on his condition. At 11.05pm, the two attackers swooped on a third man, a 24-year-old, on Shoreditch High Street, throwing acid in his face but stealing nothing. His injuries are life-changing, police said. Within 15 minutes they struck again, throwing the corrosive liquid at a man on Cazenove Road and causing ""life-changing"" facial injuries. The final assault was reported at 11.37pm, when a 33-year-old man was confronted as he sat on his moped in traffic on Chatsworth Road. He was also sprayed in the face, the moped stolen and both attackers fled. The victim made his way home before calling police, after which he was taken to hospital with no update on his condition. Witness John Moody told Sky News he heard a ""really nasty scream"" and ""banging, shouting and crashing"". ""They (police) took the guy's shirt off and started dowsing him in cold water,"" he said. ""As they were doing this more police arrived and also more food delivery moped riders."" A petition to restrict the sale of acid and bring in a licence system currently has more than 360,000 names The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, said she is looking at whether a change in the law is needed. She told LBC Radio: ""I don't want people to think this is happening all over London all the time, it is really not, but we are concerned because the numbers appear to be going up. ""We will arrest people, we will enforce the law as we can, and we are working very closely with the Home Office to try to see if there is any changes in the law required."" Labour MP Stephen Timms, who will lead a House of Commons debate on the issue on Monday, has called for tougher sentences and suggested that carrying sulphuric acid without a good reason should be treated as seriously as carrying a knife. The attacks come days after a man appeared in court charged with throwing acid at a 21-year-old woman and her cousin. Resham Khan, 21, and Jameel Muhktar, 37, were left with life-changing injuries after the attack in Beckton, east London, on 21 June. There was another acid attack in east London on Easter Monday, leaving two people at a nightclub partially blinded and others injured. :: Any witnesses, anyone with information or in possession of footage of these incidents should contact police via 101 or via Twitter @MetCC.

It's an occasion that has led many newspapers and commentators to reflect on the Duchess's position within the Royal Family and ask whether public perception has changed towards the woman who for years lived in the shadow of Prince Charles's ex-wife Princess Diana. Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty Magazine said: ""The public were doubtful about Camilla and that's one of the reasons their marriage was, for a royal wedding, low-key. ""What she did was very gently introduce herself into royal life, so to start with she did very few engagements she was just at Prince Charles's side so people could she was supportive of him. ""She always did charity work but it was very low profile, and then she took on some perhaps less glamorous charities, and very, very slowly she just was herself and people saw what a nice lady she is."" There is still debate about whether the general public would accept her as Queen when Prince Charles becomes King. In April constitutional expert Lord Norton of Louth, a peer in the House of Lords and professor at the University of Hull, told Sky News the constitutional position is very clear. He said: ""Upon the death of the Queen, Charles automatically becomes King, that is it, his wife will become Queen Consort, formally established by precedent. But if she wishes to be known by another title, that's a matter of royal prerogative, so the monarch could determine that another style will be employed."" When they were married in April 2005 it was announced that Camilla would be given, what some saw as the lesser title of Princess Consort and not Queen Consort when her husband became King. Some suggested it was a nod to the public mood about their relationship and the death of Princess Diana. Ms Seward said: ""The whole Diana situation has always been very difficult for Camilla. It won't go away and hasn't gone away. But she can't really acknowledge it as it is 20 years ago and whatever she does she doesn't comment on it. ""Obviously there are people who will never like Camilla as they see her as the person who broke up the marriage."" In the past decade Camilla has become an important part of the upper tier of the Royal Family, she carries out Royal duties on behalf of the Queen, and was also made a privy councillor by her mother in law. Her charity work is also worthy of acknowledgement, but rarely gets a huge amount of media coverage. She has a particular interest in literacy, animal welfare, osteoporosis but more striking is her work with rape crisis and domestic violence charities and the support she has given to campaigns against human trafficking and female genital mutilation. Her 70th birthday has brought renewed interest in Camilla, probably quite overwhelming for a woman who is more than happy to stay out of the limelight when she can."

The meeting of specialists is the latest stage of a court battle over the best course of action for Charlie, who suffers from a rare genetic condition and has brain damage. :: What next for Charlie Gard case? It will be attended by Charlie's mother, Connie Yates, after a judge ruled she could be present for the gathering. Ms Yates and Charlie's father, Chris Gard, want to be allowed to take their son to New York to undergo a trial therapy overseen by Dr Hirano.

2017-07-17,Tough new rules on gender stereotyping in advertising are being introduced to end outdated expectations of women cleaning and washing while men struggle to do basic domestic duties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/gender-stereotypes-to-be-banned-in-british-adverts-10952271,"These stereotypes can be harmful and help drive ""unfair outcomes"" particularly for younger people, according to research cited by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The report: Deceptions, Perceptions and Harm concludes a tougher line is needed on adverts which feature gender stereotyping. Report author Ella Smiley told Sky News: ""We know that depicting gender stereotypes in ads has the potential to reinforce expectations as to how groups or individuals should look or behave because of their gender - and that can have a potentially harmful effect on the way people consider their own aspirations and potential, as well as their expectations as to how others should behave."" The new standards will not stop all stereotyping but they will ban certain scenarios. For example, a woman with sole responsibility for clearing up family mess, a man failing to do basic household chores, or an advert suggesting an activity is inappropriate for boys or girls because it is often associated with the other sex. Ms Smiley added: ""Our focus is on ensuring ads don't mislead, harm or offend. ""So we'll be using everything we've learnt from this report to offer new standards, ensuring that new ads don't contain anything that could potentially be harmful. ""The industry will be using these standards to do what it does best - to create fantastic ads."" The issue is a hot topic within many advertising agencies who now realise that the days when the man took a leading role in adverts is long over. Jamie Williams, a partner at London-based Isobel, said: ""I think now we talk about this a lot and we understand it a lot. ""Certainly within our agency, looking at roles within the content we produce is really important so are we reflecting society accurately, who are, what is the make up of our cast."" The new standards will come into force next year and any ad in breach of the rules will be withdrawn. Many have welcomed the decision to strengthen the existing regulations. Psychologist Emma Kenny said: ""We need to regulate marketing and advertising standards so that they start to represent the reality of what it's like to be a human being. ""And that means removing the restrictions that they place, funnelling girls down one route funnelling boys down the other because ultimately the majority of individuals fall somewhere in between. ""It is the marketers that have created those gender stereotypes."""

""We are going to be consulting on new legislation so that people can't buy knives online without having their identity checked. ""At the moment you have to do it by the click of a button. ""What we are proposing is that if you want to buy a knife online it has to be collected from a place where you have to show your ID. ""We have evidence that young people have been able to buy knives without verifying their ID and I want to stop that."" Calls for action on internet sales intensified last year after a court heard a knife used in the fatal stabbing of Bailey Gwynne, an Aberdeen schoolboy, was purchased online. The knife crime consultation will also aim to close a loophole that means police can be powerless to act if they discover knives in someone's home. A ban on the possession of outlawed weapons such as zombie knives and knuckledusters on private property would mean officers can seize them and make arrests. The consultation will also ask if the offence of possessing a knife in a public place and school should be extended to universities. Recent national crime figures showed the majority of police forces - 33 out of 44 - registered a rise in offences involving knives and sharp instruments last year. Officers say youths are keeping blades on them for reasons including ""status"" and self-protection, as well as crime."
2017-07-17,Pictures of Winnie the Pooh have been banned on Chinese social media as officials clamp down on politically-sensitive references to the bear.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/oh-bother-china-censors-winnie-the-pooh-10951307,"Authorities have deleted online comments referencing ""Little Bear Winnie"" - Pooh's Chinese name"" - leaving users with error messages telling them: ""This content is illegal."" Stickers and GIFs featuring the bear, the most famous resident of Hundred Acre Wood, have also been removed from WeChat - a messaging app used by 889 million people in the country. Some pictures of the AA Milne character and references using his English name are still permitted on the popular Twitter-like platform Weibo. No explanation for the ban has been given by officials, but the bear has been compared to Chinese President Xi Jinping in the past and the crackdown comes in the run up to China's 19th Communist Party Congress. Chinese social media users have been testing the boundaries imposed on the lovable creation of AA Milne. ""Poor Little Winnie,"" one Weibo user wrote. ""What did this adorable honey-loving bear ever do to provoke anyone?"" In 2013, a similar ban was imposed in response to a popular comparison of a photo of President Xi and then-US President Barack Obama with Pooh and his friend Tigger. #Chinese government blocks meme that compares Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh and #Obama to #Tiger! pic.twitter.com/HsP0RQ03DA The following year a photographed handshake between President Xi and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faced similar treatment.

According to the Star Tribune, her family said she had called emergency services after hearing ""a sound"" in the alley near her home late on Saturday night. Witnesses said she was in the alley, wearing pyjamas, when officers arrived in a squad car. She is said to have gone to the driver's-side door and talked to the officers through the window. The police officer in the passenger seat is reported to have pulled out his gun and shot at her. No weapon was found at the scene and the investigation is expected to include a focus on why the officers' bodycams were not recording. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension confirmed that an officer had fired a weapon, fatally striking a woman. Mayor of Minneapolis Betsy Hodges said she was ""heartsick"" over Ms Damond's death. Neighbours of the health and life coach have held a vigil for her in the alley where she died, and her family and friends have described her as ""treasured and loved"". Ms Damond, whose maiden name is believed to be Ruszczyk and who was a qualified veterinary surgeon but working as a spiritual healer, was due to marry 50-year-old Don Damond, whose name she had already taken, next month. He is reported to have been away on a business trip when she died. Both officers involved in the shooting, who have not been identified, have reportedly been placed on administrative leave."

But despite this latest round of talks lasting for four days, Mr Davis returned to the UK after a few hours, leaving officials to press ahead with negotiations until he returns on Thursday. A picture of Mr Davis sitting opposite Mr Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, also caused a stir - with the Brexit Secretary having no notes or papers in front of him while Mr Barnier had a thick folder of papers. Sky News has been told Mr Davis did have notes in his bag. Jonathan Haslam, Number 10 director of communications under former prime minister John Major, told Sky News he was surprised Mr Davis chose to head back so soon. He said: ""It sends out the wrong signals to the EU and also opens up an avenue where people can say 'why is he rushing back?' ""Is this to carry on manoeuvres? Is he worried about his position back home? We know divided governments, divided parties, don't ring through in the long term."" Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""We have less than 20 months of Brexit talks left, yet David Davis has skulked back to the UK after just half a day. ""He didn't have any position papers with him because this Government has no agreed Brexit position. ""This is a Government with no papers, no plan and no time for the most important negotiations of a lifetime."" But the Department for Exiting the EU said there was nothing unusual in Mr Davis leaving when he did. A spokesperson said: ""As with any other international negotiation, those talks have now moved to technical working level discussions where over 90 UK officials will meet with their counterparts in the Commission enabling multiple conversations to take place at once. ""David Davis and Michel Barnier will be updated throughout the talks, before returning to negotiating table later this week. This approach is entirely consistent with all international negotiations, including the G7 and G20."" Mr Barnier offered Mr Davis a ""warm welcome"" and said the latest round of discussions would ""delve into the heart of the matter"". Mr Davis said his priority for this week's talks was citizens' rights, with a new push to lift uncertainty for the three million EU citizens living in the UK and one million Britons living in the EU. ""We made a good start last month, and this week we'll be getting into the real substance,"" he said. Also on the agenda this week are the contentious issues of the financial settlement for the UK leaving the EU and the arrangements for the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Meanwhile, Theresa May will remind her ministers that Cabinet discussions should be kept private following a series of damaging leaks. The Prime Minister will tell members of her top team they should keep quiet about the content of meetings and focus on getting on with the job of governing. The bid to instil discipline comes after alleged comments by Chancellor Philip Hammond were leaked to the press, with the disclosures culminating in an unnamed minister telling one newspaper Mr Hammond ""is trying to ""f*** up"" Brexit."

Former president Barack Obama ordered their seizure in December as well as the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats. Russia has vehemently denied any involvement in election hacking. Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov will meet US undersecretary of state Thomas Shannon to try to thrash out a solution on Monday. His boss, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, was also reported as saying on a visit to Belarus that ""anti-Russian feeling"" in the United States meant it was not certain that Moscow and Washington could agree on key global issues. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""We consider it absolutely unacceptable to place conditions on the return of diplomatic property, we consider that it must be returned without any conditions and talking."" President Vladimir Putin raised the issue with Donald Trump when they met for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg this month. Mr Obama said he was ordering the ban due to US intelligence reports of Russian hacking and an alleged influence campaign to sway the US presidential election in Mr Trump's favour. He said Moscow was using the compounds for ""intelligence-related purposes"". The Russian President held off from retaliating at the time and said he would wait to see how Mr Trump reacted after he came into the White House. However, hopes that Mr Trump will soon act on his campaign pledges to boost relations have faded as any ties to Moscow have become toxic. The White House has faced a maelstrom of US investigations into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Russia is intensifying its threats that it could now retaliate by blocking a country house and a storage facility used by the US Embassy in Moscow. Mr Lavrov said last week: ""If Washington decides not to solve this issue, we will have to take counter actions."" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained that the US was also refusing to issue visas for Russian diplomats to replace those expelled."

Dagmara's mother said in a statement that her daughter had been called names, and had overheard racist comments such as ""stupid Pole"". The teenager, who had lived in Britain with her family for nine years, had also told her boyfriend that she had been told to ""go back to your own country"". The aspiring photographer had reportedly been looking forward to her school prom and shopping for a dress with her mother. She had already won a place to study photography at Truro College. Her mother, Ewelina, told the court her daughter had been having trouble with some of the girls at her school and had specifically mentioned an incident just days before her death when one girl had ""called Dagmara names"". She said: ""I don't know whether these incidents were racist in nature. However, I can say that on several occasions she overheard comments such as 'stupid Pole'."" A pastoral support worker at Pool Academy, Susan Kent, told the court: ""To the best of my knowledge, Dagmara never mentioned any problems with racism to me or any other person at school."" The majority of the teenager's friends, and her boyfriend, Lewis Simpson, all went to a different school. The day before she was found dead at school, Dagmara had been taken to hospital by her uncle, Tomasz Dobek, after punching a wall during a PE lesson. She had told Mr Dobek she was angry because some girls were laughing at her. On the morning of her death, she had called her uncle crying and saying she had taken some tablets. However, her parents sent her to school when they saw no physical signs she was unwell. Described by her teachers as a ""lovely girl"", Dagmara was also reported to have been worried about her exams and concerned she may have dyslexia. The inquest continues and is expected to last for three days."
2017-07-17,Citi will become the latest Wall Street giant to unveil plans to cope with the UK's departure from the European Union this week when it names Frankfurt as the location for a major new trading operation.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/wall-street-giant-citi-to-unveil-brexit-plan-for-new-eu-unit-10952031,"Sky News has learnt that Citi executives have finalised plans to establish a second EU-based broker-dealer, which will handle many of the market trading activities currently undertaken in London. The US bank has decided to name Frankfurt as the location for the new broker-dealer after also evaluating Paris as an alternative, according to insiders. Citi's decision reflects the issue confronting all international banks which rely on the EU's passporting regime to trade seamlessly across national borders. The likes of Barclays, JP Morgan, HSBC and UBS have talked in recent weeks about the acceleration of their contingency planning, even as Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, stressed his determination to secure a transitional period enabling companies to contend with the impact of Brexit. David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, led a new round of talks with EU officials on Monday, although the post-election period has seen growing concern in the UK business community about the Government's ability to negotiate a good deal. Jim Cowles, the chief executive of Citi's operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told a conference earlier this year that it would make a decision about the bank's Brexit plans within months. ""Our issue is with our broker dealer, which is located in the UK and will lose, presumably, passporting rights,"" he said. Citi, which was among a quartet of Wall Street banks which donated money to the campaign to keep the UK in the EU, warned staff shortly before last year's referendum that a vote to leave would have implications for some of its 9,000-strong UK workforce. ""To continue to serve our clients and maintain efficient access to those markets currently enabled through the EU passporting regime, we would likely need to rebalance our operations across the EU,"" James Bardrick, Citi's UK chief country officer, said at the time. Initially, Citi's decision about its new EU-based broker-dealer will not affect more than approximately 150 UK-based jobs, an insider said. However, they added that the bank would also update UK-based employees this week on plans to bulk up its other EU-based operations as Brexit looms, with Dublin likely to be the biggest beneficiary of such moves. A number ""in the low hundreds"" would be affected by other Brexit-related re-allocations of staff unrelated to the broker-dealer operation, an insider said. Citi already employs about 2,500 people in Dublin. Citi's announcement is set to come just days after the Prudential Regulation Authority, the UK banking regulator, imposed a deadline for international banks to submit details of their Brexit contingency plans. If Citi does plump for Frankfurt, it would be another shot in the arm for Germany's financial capital, with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and the Japanese firms Daiwa Securities and Nomura among the other firms to outline plans to establish or grow operations there. Estimates of the number of financial services jobs that will be lost to the UK because of Brexit vary widely, but when added to related professional services jobs, it could be in the tens of thousands, according to some forecasts. ""We believe the UK's position as a global leader in many areas of financial services is in no small part aided by efficient and effective access to the EU's single market, the largest single market in the world, with 500 million citizens as potential customers and employees,"" Mr Bardrick said last year. A Citi spokeswoman declined to comment on Monday."
2017-07-17,Education Secretary Justine Greening has announced an extra £1.3bn in funding for schools over the next two years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/extra-13bn-in-funding-for-schools-announced-by-justine-greening-10951944,"Ms Greening said the money, which will come from savings within the Department for Education, would give schools and high-needs programmes ""the investment they need to offer a world-class education to every single child"". But shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the cash was not new and was ""nothing more than a sticking plaster"". Addressing MPs in the Commons, Ms Greening said the Government had ""recognised"" voters' concerns during the election campaign over the ""overall level of funding in schools, as well as its distribution"". The Education Secretary also confirmed plans for a national funding formula aimed at cutting historic gaps in spending between different areas. She said the investment announced on Monday would mean that core funding for schools and high-needs would go up from almost £41bn in 2017/18 to £42.4bn in 2018/19 and £43.5bn in 2019/20. ""It will mean that the total schools budget will increase by £2.6bn between this year and 2019/20, and per pupil funding will now be maintained in real terms for the remaining two years of the spending review period to 2019/20,"" Ms Greening said. She added that this investment would increase the basic amount of funding for every pupil, with up to 3% gain per year per pupil for underfunded schools and a 0.5% increase per pupil for every school. Ms Greening said it would provide at least £4,800 per pupil for every secondary school. In terms of where the money will come from, the Education Secretary told MPs that £420m would be found from the main schools capital budget, while £280m could be saved in efficiencies from the free schools programme. ""This will include delivering 30 of those 140 schools through the local authority route, rather than the free schools route,"" she said. Ms Greening said the rest of the money would come from reprioritising spending and moving money to the core schools programme. Responding to the announcement, Ms Rayner said more needed to be done. ""Per pupil funding will still fall over the course of this Parliament unless further action is taken urgently,"" she said. ""I will welcome the opportunity to protect budgets for our schools but this statement alone will do nothing of the kind."" Ms Rayner said it was ""astounding"" that ""this is all being funded without a penny of new money"", and called on Ms Greening to be ""honest"" with MPs and reveal who will lose out. ""She said the full funding formula has been delayed again, with local authorities playing a role in setting budgets until 2020,"" Ms Rayner said. ""Is this because she has finally acknowledged the role local authorities have to play, or has she simply realised to fully implement her plans she would need to pass primary legislation - and her Government is so weak and wobbly they cannot even get new money for schools passed through this House."""
2017-07-17,Two Holocaust survivors are to share their stories with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/holocaust-survivors-face-past-on-royal-tour-of-stutthof-concentration-camp-10952259,"Zigi Shipper and Manfred Goldberg, 87, were sent to the Stutthof concentration camp near Gdansk in Poland by the Nazis when they were just 14. The two men will share their experiences when the Royals visit Stutthof during the second day of their tour of Poland and Germany. Mr Shipper and Mr Goldberg moved to the UK after World War Two and this will be the first time they have returned to the camp. Speaking about his decision to go back, Mr Goldberg said: ""For me it is quite a seismic event because, since I was permitted to come to England in September 1946, I have not set foot in either Germany or Poland. ""I decided that I really had to face the past and hence my consent to come."" Describing the conditions in the camp, Mr Shipper said: ""The weather I thought was going to kill me because it was like well below zero and you know we were wearing striped pyjamas because that's what we got in Auschwitz. ""I never ever - except in Stutthof - thought that I was going to die. ""You saw people in front of you dying but I never thought I was going to die except in Stutthof."" Like thousands of Jewish children and their families in the Second World War, Mr Shipper and Mr Goldberg were rounded up by the Nazis and forced into slave labour while living in the most inhumane conditions. Mr Goldberg said they were regularly forced to watch public executions. He said: ""Jewish lives just did not count. ""We had to assemble in a square. ""They had erected an enormous gallows with eight nooses hanging down, then one by one we had to watch these innocent men being hanged."" Around 110,000 people from 28 countries were imprisoned in Stutthof. As many as 65,000, including 28,000 Jews died. Mr Shipper and Mr Goldberg, who share their stories through the Holocaust Educational Trust, believe that close friendships kept them alive. Mr Shipper said: ""I said to my friends I can't walk, they said they'll help me, that was him and other people like that. ""Had it not been for them, I would not have been here today. ""I wouldn't have survived. ""They said: 'You know what will happen to you if you don't walk - they will shoot you'."" ""I said: 'But I can't walk', they said: 'We'll help you'."" Mr Goldberg added: ""If one of us got a bit more food than the other, we were able to share, live and let live, and generally give encouragement. ""That was probably the most vital aspect friendship in the camp, because none of us knew any morning whether we would still be alive that evening, quite literally life was a lottery."""
2017-07-17,"It was billed as the snap election to strengthen Theresa May's negotiating hand in Brussels, but instead it has left her too weak to control her own Cabinet amid tensions over the terms of Brexit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/downing-street-power-vacuum-has-unleashed-tory-civil-war-10951857,"The fault line that has run through the Tory party for decades over Europe that burst open during the referendum campaign in 2016 has blown up once more: there is a power vacuum in No 10 and it has unleashed a civil war. There is intense jostling for position as the would-be successors to the mortally wounded Mrs May - Boris Johnson, David Davis, Philip Hammond - stake their claim to her crown and knife each other (look to the anti-Hammond briefings over the weekend). But there is also a more substantive issue that is fuelling these tensions around what sort of Brexit Britain fights for over the next 18 months. Around the Cabinet table the splits of the referendum campaign are re-opening. Leading Brexiteers Mr Johnson and Michael Gove worry that key Remainer Mr Hammond is using the indecisive election result to frustrate, or at least soften, Brexit by pushing for a business-friendly exit. It has engulfed the Cabinet in all-out war, with leaking and finger pointing at fever pitch. One senior Tory on the Remain side of the debate has told me he believes Mr Johnson and Mr Gove were behind the attacks on Mr Hammond. Obsessed by a hard Brexit, ""they are prepared to run the economy off a cliff"" said the source, adding that the two Brexiteers are irked by the Chancellor's insistence that the Tories will put victory at the next election at risk if they push for an ""ideological"" Brexit over an ""economic"" one. Of course the Tory party has been here before. There were the wilderness years at the turn of the millennium - the Iain Duncan Smith and William Hague period - when the infighting became so bitter that Michael Howard was installed as a caretaker leader to re-unify the party. The infighting evokes memories of the embattled premiership of Sir John Major, who became so worn down by the running battles over Europe that he resigned (and was re-elected Tory leader) in a bid to silence his critics; The Tories then lost the next three elections. Mrs May's spokesperson tried to re-assert her authority, insisting the Prime Minister will put a lid back on the bubbling tensions after astonishing Cabinet leaks over the weekend. She might not find much support around her Cabinet table, but in the bowels of the backbenches, MPs are growing increasingly exasperated by the manoeuvrings of more senior colleagues. One MP has told me he wants to see Mrs May to ""get a grip"" and warned the continuous infighting only served to propel Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn closer to No 10. So, with the support of the parliamentary party, and crucially the chair of the 1922 backbench committee Graham Brady, Mrs May won't face an imminent leadership challenge. But what happens when the meat is put on to the bones of the Brexit deal - the cost of the divorce, the compromise of citizens' rights, the transition arrangements? Hopelessly divided already, it's easy to see how Mrs May's Conservatives could implode over the nuts and bolts of Brexit. After a bruising couple of months, the summer recess can't come soon enough for the PM. But it can only offer some brief respite from those Cabinet wars. The snap election has left Mrs May with the worst of both worlds, in Downing Street but not in power. Expect hostilities to resume in time for Tory party conference in October."

Police were called to Market Street in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, at 10pm on Thursday. They had received reports that two men had entered a store and demanded cash, threatening staff at a Co-op store with a golf club and baseball bat. One of the suspects got away in a waiting vehicle, but Shane Bryant, 29, was held in the street near the store until officers arrived. He died in hospital in Nottingham on Saturday after being taken ill at the scene. Leicestershire Police said ""a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm to allow officers to carry out a prompt and balanced investigation"". The force added: ""He has since been released from police custody pending further investigation."" Detective Chief Inspector Di Coulson said: ""We are keen to have any dashcam and mobile phone footage that anyone may have of the incident on Thursday night. ""There were lots of people in the area who saw what happened and were involved in apprehending Mr Bryant. ""No matter how short or insignificant you think it is, we would like to see it please."" A friend of Mr Bryant, Serina Larvin, has set up a fundraising page, saying: ""A much loved friend of our community got taken away in unexpected circumstances.

The source said that Mrs May told her audience that there should be ""no backbiting, no carping"". Perhaps reacting to reports of ministers trying to oust her, she also warned that the ""choice is me or Jeremy Corbyn"", adding: ""Nobody wants that."" :: Five ways Jeremy Corbyn could take power Her comments come after a series of leaks targeting Chancellor Philip Hammond. She is expected to remind a Cabinet meeting today that sensitive meetings must remain private. Mr Hammond made headlines last week after an unnamed minister accused him of trying to ""f*** up"" Brexit. He is also accused of saying that ""even a woman can drive a train"" - something he denies - while talking about public sector pay. :: The danger that lies ahead for Theresa May A spokesman for the PM would not discuss the leaks but told reporters: ""Of course, Cabinet must be able to hold discussions of Government policy in private and the Prime Minister will be reminding her colleagues of that at the Cabinet meeting."" The row is being perceived as another example of the PM's weakness in the wake of June's election, which saw her lose her Commons majority. Asked whether Cabinet members were seeking to undermine Mr Hammond, Home Secretary Amber Rudd insisted ministers were ""united in wanting to make sure that we deliver a Brexit that does protect the economy"". ""Philip Hammond has talked about that and he is absolutely right to do so."" Former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine told Sky's All Out Politics show that Mrs May's call for unity ""won't have any effect"" and said the Government was currently not functioning properly, merely ""coping with the trauma of Brexit"". The Tory infighting somewhat overshadowed Monday's announcement of an extra £1.3bn in funding for schools over the next two years. Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is one of those tipped as a possible successor to Mrs May, returned to Westminster after a brief visit to Brussels for the start of the latest Brexit negotiations. He was accused of ""skulking"" away from the talks, after spending just a few hours with the EU's Michel Barnier and their respective teams. A picture of Mr Davis sitting opposite Mr Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, also caused a stir - with the Brexit Secretary having no notes or papers in front of him while Mr Barnier had a thick folder of documents."
2017-07-17,"Identifying the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire is becoming ""more difficult"", a coroner has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/identifying-grenfell-tower-victims-is-becoming-more-difficult-10951913,"At least 80 people are believed to have died in the devastating blaze at the 24-storey building last month, but only 37 victims have been formally identified so far. Coroner's Office manager Eric Sword told a short hearing at Westminster Coroner's Court that the difficulty in identifying victims was a result of ""what we are dealing with, what we are recovering from the scene"". A 13-year-old boy was among the latest victims to be named as four more inquests were opened on Monday. Yahya Hashim was identified through dental records after his remains were recovered from the 22nd floor, and the teenager's family were in court to hear his inquest opened and adjourned. Also named was Sirria Choucair, a 60-year-old grandmother. She too was found on the 22nd floor of the tower block. Five members of her family have been reported missing since the fire, including three young girls. Majorie Vital was the third victim to be named at Monday's hearing. The 68-year-old woman had been recovered from the 23rd floor. She was identified through dental records - as was 79-year-old Kamru Miah, who was found on the 17th floor. The provisional cause of death for all four victims was ""consistent with the effects of fire"". All four inquests have been adjourned while the criminal investigation into the fire continues. It comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called on the Prime Minister to broaden the inquiry into the fire, amid ""considerable concern among residents and others that the judge has already been directed towards narrowly defined terms of reference which will not bring residents the answers they seek"". Mr Corbyn said splitting the inquiry into two parts would increase confidence in the process. Under the Opposition's proposal, the first part of the inquiry would report back this summer ""to minimise further suffering of survivors"" - providing urgent answers about what started the fire, why it spread so rapidly, why residents' complaints were not acted upon and whether building regulations were contravened. The second part of the inquiry would examine current fire regulations, housing allocation policies, and whether local councils and fire services are adequately funded. Mr Corbyn said: ""We would be disrespecting the memory of those who died in the Grenfell fire, and putting further lives at risk, if we fail to fully learn these lessons. ""The importance of residents and victims' families having full confidence in this inquiry cannot be underestimated."""
2017-07-17,The Government has confirmed that 16 newly built properties in South Yorkshire will be demolished to make way for the HS2 railway.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/new-homes-will-be-bulldozed-to-make-way-for-hs2-railway-line-10951967,"Residents on the Shimmer housing estate in Mexborough have learned they will lose their homes after ministers finalised the route for the controversial high-speed line. Affected homeowners will be offered comparable properties, the Department for Transport has promised. The Government has concluded that this route will result in considerably fewer demolitions, as proposed alternatives would require greater numbers of homes and businesses to be knocked down. But some campaigners have argued that the impact HS2 will have on the Shimmer housing estate is being downplayed, as 216 homes were originally planned at the site. The demolitions were revealed as the DfT confirmed the final route of the Manchester and Leeds sections of HS2, which will extend the high-speed line being built from London to Birmingham. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said the route will create new connections between Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield and the East Midlands. He added: ""By building a whole new railway line for high-speed intercity connections, we will free up local services, meaning more comfort, more seats and more trains for passengers across the North and the Midlands. ""We will now press ahead with building the line, while continuing to ensure affected communities get appropriate support and are treated with fairness, compassion and respect."" Some residents at the Shimmer housing estate have expressed concern that the Government will not give them a decent price for their properties. ""What they're offering you is peanuts,"" Nigel Hogue told Sky News. Stop HS2 has also responded angrily to the announcement - claiming the Government had shown ""sheer arrogance"" by choosing the route ""without even assessing the public response to the consultation"". Chairwoman Penny Gaines said: ""While it has been presented to help transport in the North, HS2 is mainly about making it easier to get to London, as there are no east-west links involved. ""It will make no difference to journeys from Leeds to Manchester or Sheffield to Manchester."""

The bank itself faces the same charge while Barclays, Varley and Jenkins also face a charge relating to fundraising in October 2008 and are accused too of providing unlawful financial assistance. The four men appeared at Southwark Crown Court on Monday to be told by the judge, Mr Justice Edis, that their trial would begin on 9 January 2019. The trial is expected to last up to four months. It is the first trial of its kind against a bank and former executives for activities during the financial crisis. Varley was chief executive of Barclays between 2004 and 2011. Kalaris used to lead the bank's wealth and investment management division, while Boath was former head of the European financial institutions group at Barclays. Jenkins, who left the bank in 2009, was investment banking chief."

The watchdog said it was working with police on how to investigate the claims. It has also called for the Government to consider ways of reducing the risk of the rules being abused and for urgent action to tackle the number of duplicate applications by people who are not aware they are already registered. Although some people, like students, can be registered in two areas, it is against the law to vote more than once in an election. The Electoral Commission's report states: ""Although people may lawfully be registered to vote in more than one place in certain circumstances, it is troubling that some voters appear to have admitted voting more than once at the General Election, which is an offence."" The watchdog said nearly two million young people applied to vote after Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would call a snap election. About 500,000 more people were on the electoral roll for the 8 June poll than in 2015, taking the electorate to 46.8 million, its highest ever number. A total of 2.9 million people attempted to register, with 96% applying online and 69%, 1.9 million, of those aged under 34. Electoral registration officers say the numbers of applications from people who were already registered were high, ranging from an estimated 30% to 70% across the country. Duplicate applications are not automatically detected because the information is held locally. According to the watchdog, potential solutions include introducing a system to allow voters to check if they are already registered and adopting automatic registration schemes similar to those used in Australia. Electoral Commission chairman Sir John Holmes said: ""The size of the registered electorate for the General Election demonstrates the UK's strong tradition of democratic engagement, and reflects the hard work of all concerned. ""However, if we are to keep pace with modern habits and practice in a digital world, the electoral registration system must continue to evolve, and consider innovative solutions such as direct or automatic enrolment processes. ""These have the potential to deliver significant improvements to the accuracy and completeness of electoral registers as well as efficiencies for local authorities and the public purse."""

Grabiner spent 15 years leading the Taveta board, which came under fire from MPs for providing ""weak"" corporate governance that contributed ""substantially"" to the demise of BHS. Sky News reported in May that the chairman was on the verge of quitting. Taveta is the company that owns Sir Philip's Arcadia retail empire, whose brands include Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. Arcadia employs more than 24,000 people and has an annual turnover of more than £2bn. Sir Philip owned BHS for 15 years before selling the loss-making retailer to Dominic Chappell, a serial bankrupt with no retail experience, for £1 in 2015. It collapsed the following year with the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving 20,000 pension scheme members facing an uncertain future. Sir Philip came under severe criticism from MPs, who called for him to be stripped of his knighthood. Earlier this year, he agreed to pay £363m to plug a hole in BHS retirement schemes. Brady has been on the Taveta board as non-executive director since 2010. Sir Philip said he was ""delighted"" to announce her appointment to chair the board, which she has assumed immediately, and thanked Lord Grabiner for 15 years of service. Brady said: ""I look forward to working with my colleagues as we concentrate on driving the Arcadia brands forward on their global expansion."" Baroness Brady is well known to television viewers as an adviser to Lord Alan Sugar on BBC reality show The Apprentice. In 2013 she was named business ambassador by then prime minister David Cameron. The Taveta announcement comes after the company's most recent annual results showed pre-tax profits falling from £172m to £37m for the year to 27 August last year. Sales were down 2.5% while the business was also hit by costs linked to the collapse of BHS."

A Primark spokesman confirmed the flip flops contain chrysene, which is commonly used in dark-coloured dyes. The recalled footwear - colour options black, blue and khaki - were on sale in Primark shops from 4 January to 2 June 2017. The company's website says the flip flops do not ""meet the Primark usual high standards for chemical compliance"" and have ""levels of a restricted substance in excess of the 1.0 mg/kg requirement"". A ""thorough investigation"" has now been launched by the shop, which confirmed it had suspended all new orders. A Primark spokesman told Sky News: ""We take the safety of our customers, and the quality of our products, very seriously, which is why we have chosen to recall three men's flip flops from our Cedar Wood State range. ""All new orders with this factory have been suspended while we carry out a thorough investigation. A full refund is being offered to all customers."" Primark was unable to confirm the location of the factory in which the flip flops were made. Earlier this year, Primark was forced to recall pairs of novelty cat leggings after it was discovered that small pink bows on the knees posed a potential choking hazard. In February, a range of t-shirts with a design inspired by the US series The Walking Dead caused widespread controversy after some customers branded them ""racist"" and ""offensive"". The black t-shirts pictured a bloody baseball bat wrapped with barbed wire, with the phrase ""Eeny meeny miny moe"". A Primark spokesman said at the time: ""The t-shirt in question is licensed merchandise for the US television series, The Walking Dead, and the quote and image are taken directly from the show.

The happy couple celebrated with 20 fellow 'overwinterers' - the nickname used for those who spend winter in Antarctica - while temperatures were well below freezing. The pair, who have been together for 11 years, are both experienced mountaineers working as mountain instructors and expedition leaders. Ms Baum, from Yoxall, Staffordshire, said: ""Getting married in Antarctica feels like it was meant to be. There is no better place really - I love snowy mountains and spending time in amazing places with awesome people."" With the help of some of the women at the station, Ms Baum made her own dress and sewed in part of an old orange pyramid tent for her 'something old' requirement. Mr Sylvester, from Sheffield, said: ""We have always wanted to have a small personal wedding but never imagined we'd be able to get married in one of the most remote places on Earth."" Rothera Research Station leader Paul Samways, who is also British Antarctic Territory (BAT) Magistrate, conducted the ceremony while the station chef prepared the wedding menu. Mr Samways said: ""Having spent time with Julie and Tom over the Austral summer and half of the Antarctic winter I feel amazingly privileged to be able to be part of their story. ""They are amazing people, and being responsible for joining them in marriage is an incredible honour."" It is the first wedding since the British Antarctic Territory marriage law was reformed in 2016. The changes made it easier for marriages to be arranged there. The wedding has been registered with the BAT Government and is valid in the UK."
2017-07-17,The impact of Brexit has landed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170718023720/http://news.sky.com/story/easyjets-new-airline-is-a-clever-and-expensive-response-to-brexit-10948538,"There will now be three easyJets, all with a capital letter in the wrong place and all located in different places - one in the UK, one in Switzerland and now one in Austria. This new airline, easyJetEurope, will come with its own fleet of planes and its own staff, but make no mistake - it is part of easyJet's UK operations. The planes won't actually spend their lives in Austria, the big decisions will still be made in Luton. This is a clever, and rather expensive, answer to a new problem. For easyJet, this is a £10m insurance policy against the dreaded prospect of having to curtail - hugely - its timetable of flights around Europe. That might seem an unlikely prospect, but it's one that is now giving sleepless nights to plenty within Britain's airline industry. Put simply, there is a huge and complex set of rules that governs the ability of airlines to fly their planes. They govern which countries the airlines can start off from, where they can go to, which passengers they can pick up, where they can drop them off, and then where they can fly to next. They are rules of which most of us have remained oblivious to for years. After all, when you get on a plane you tend to take it for granted that the flight is allowed to go to its destination. But these rules (often abbreviated to ""Open Skies"", even though that bit actually just regulates flights across the Atlantic) are a construct of the European Union. And so, if Brexit happened tomorrow, the UK would drop out of the regulatory framework and, all of a sudden, many of the flights between Britain and Europe would be grounded. Talk to just about anyone in the airline industry and they'll tell you that such a scenario would be so damaging to both sides that it's almost impossible to conceive. British passengers want to come to Europe to do business or go on holiday, and vice versa. Nobody, so the argument runs, benefits if the UK leaves the EU without some kind of refreshed airspace agreement. But the problem is that while it may be almost impossible to imagine that scenario, it's not actually impossible. It could happen. The politics of the EU are Byzantine and unpredictable at the best of times, and the negotiations around Brexit will be long, complicated and full of pockets of European self-interest. There may just be those politicians who rather like the idea of leaving British planes standing idle on the tarmac for a while. For the British airline industry, we can divide the problem into two parts. Firstly, it's flights that start in the UK and fly to a foreign destination - Manchester to Madrid, for example, or Heathrow to New York. Secondly, it's the flights that are run by a UK airline, but which fly entirely outside the UK. Let's say, for example, from Barcelona to Paris or between Berlin and Nice. Both of those routes are offered by easyJet. It is in order to protect these intra-European flights that easyJet has created its new company. By having a new European operation, based in Austria, it can claim an Air Operators Certificate and that, in turn, means it can fly routes within the European Union. This is exactly the same logic as many big banks, especially American banks, are now applying. Like airline companies, they don't know what regulatory framework likes ahead, and nor do they have the luxury of being able to wait and see. In fact, they have legal obligations to manage risks and make contingency plans. In the case of banks, that means adding to their British operations by setting up subsidiaries on the European mainland, allowing them to carry on working across Europe. Easyjet, really, has just done the same thing. This is a tangible example of the Brexit impact, and it won't be the last. But of all the major industries fretting about what could happen over the next couple of years, the aviation business appears to face a distinctly different set of variables. The concept of Open Skies is so embedded into our life that we take it for granted. The mere kernel of an idea that it could disappear, that planes could be grounded and flights to Europe might be suspended, is causing nerves and consternation. For easyJet, perhaps the company most worried about the impact of this disruption, this quick response might look dramatic - but it also looks smart."
2017-07-18,A German teenager is reported to be among five women arrested for supporting Islamic State in the Iraqi city of Mosul.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/german-girl-16-reportedly-arrested-in-mosul-for-supporting-is-10952937,"Photos of a pale-skinned girl being detained by Iraqi security services have been circulating on social media since the weekend. It is now being investigated whether the girl is Linda Wenzel, who went missing last summer from eastern Germany. The 16-year-old, from the small town of Pulsnitz near the city of Dresden, travelled to Turkey about a year ago with the aim of reaching Iraq or Syria before security services lost track of her. Miss Wenzel is believed to have converted to Islam before the international hunt to find her began last July, and she was under investigation for alleged contact with IS over plotting a terror attack. She is reported to have gone by the name Umm Maryam, having been lured to join the jihadists via the internet. Although the German newspaper Die Welt identified the girl captured in the recently liberated city as Miss Wenzel, an Iraqi official has said he believes the teenager could be Russian. She was taken to hospital for treatment for burns after reportedly being found under rubble following fierce fighting. The girl is likely to be handed over to her home country's embassy, and not kept in Iraq. About 930 people - including children - have left Germany in recent years to join IS in Syria and Iraq, with one in five of them female. The French wife of a suspected IS fighter and her four children were found in Mosul 10 days ago, according to the country's officials. The city was recently freed from the jihadists' rule following a bloody nine-month campaign by Iraqi forces backed by US-led coalition airstrikes. More than half of the buildings in western Mosul - where IS fighters held out for the longest - have been damaged or destroyed. The city, once home to two million people, had been declared the capital of the jihadists' so-called caliphate."

Residents said the storm washed sheds out of gardens and sent hailstones the size of 50 pence pieces smashing into windows. Elsewhere, a yellow weather warning is in place through the day for large swathes of England and Wales, with the Met Office predicting a month's worth of rain could fall in some places in a matter of hours. :: Drivers warned of weekend travel 'chaos' Zoe Holmes, who manages the Bay Hotel in Coverack, told Sky News the storm was ""very extraordinary"". She said: ""We started off with ginormous hailstones and then the heavens opened and, just, floods of water everywhere. ""It was almost like a tsunami in reverse. Just torrents of water coming down the hill and pouring over the sea wall."" Ms Holmes added: ""We have a house in the village and that was up to above knee height. You can see other houses that are just devastated with water pouring out of the windows. ""It really felt like something out of a film."" Just outside the village, the flash flood sent boulders crashing into a bus as it travelled down a steep hill. Driver Thomas Duffield and a young passenger had to be rescued from the vehicle after their route was blocked off by abandoned cars. Mr Duffield said: ""I felt a little bit uneasy about taking my foot off the (brake) pedal, because it was like we were in the water rapids. ""The boulders from people's gardens were pummelling the bus. They were about the size of a wheel and kept whacking the vehicle, making loud bangs, which was obviously quite worrying. ""I thought that one large impact, at the wrong moment, could send the bus even further down the hill."" A local business owner, who did not want to be named, said the conditions were ""quite horrendous"". ""It was torrential,"" she added. ""Our neighbours across the road from us, their shed disappeared down the river. ""Our neighbours, just up the road from us, their oil tank disappeared down the river. ""I have never seen such big hails. The sun was shining and the wind was blowing and it was hailing, all at the same time."" Meanwhile, fireman Dale Reardon described the storm as ""unbelievable"". He said: ""It has affected a lot of people's homes and it could have been a lot worse. ""I don't know how long it will take for them to get their homes back to how they were."" Cornwall Council said a multi-agency emergency centre had been opened at County Hall, Truro.

This provoked criticism back in the UK, with opposition parties noting the talks are due to last until Thursday. An image of Mr Davis sat at a table with his EU counterpart with no papers also sparked claims Britain was unprepared. But EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said: ""We do not consider this as a problem and we're not concerned about it. ""Chief negotiators do not have to be present all the time, these are well-structured talks over a week, so work is ongoing and we do not feel concerned about this."" However, Mr Schinas refused to comment on suggestions officials are frustrated by the UK side's perceived lack of preparation. He also declined to answer questions on whether Britain had come up with counter proposals in response to Mr Barnier's demands for a so-called ""divorce bill"" for leaving the EU. The Commission will not be giving an assessment of the progress of the negotiations until Thursday, when Mr Davis is set to return for further talks and a news conference. ""In my notion of the English language an assessment covers what's positive and what's not positive, so stay tuned,"" Mr Schinas said. The spokesman said Britain's 98 negotiators had been welcomed to Brussels and that the Commission has a team of ""very good divorce lawyers"". ""We don't feel that we have been invaded, we have welcomed our negotiating partners in Article 50 negotiations yesterday and talks are ongoing as we speak,"" he said. It is understood Britain will not set out a position paper on the ""divorce bill"" until it is ready. It is believed to be using the talks to scrutinise the EU's position in detail and respond to each of Brussels' demands - including challenging some. Negotiators are believed to have found common ground on citizens' rights despite the EU's view that Britain's offer is below expectations and that there must be a role for the European Court of Justice. The two sides are focusing on trying to find out where their positions are similar and most of the sessions, which are covering the financial settlement, citizens' rights, Northern Ireland and separation issues including Europe's civil nuclear regulator Euratom, overran. Mr Davis has been in close touch with the UK team before he returns to Brussels on Thursday."

The sequence of verbatim accounts leaked by fellow Cabinet ministers has little precedent, like much in politics these days. The PM, though, will be obliged to tell her own Cabinet to pipe down and concentrate on serving the country. :: May to bickering Tories: It's me or Corbyn Some MPs feel a stronger prime minister would have fired the likely suspects, particularly as the Cabinet Secretary circulated in December an irate memo demanding that leakers, including ministers, be fired, even when the leaks did not include issues of national security. That memo was itself leaked. In truth, the attempt to undermine the Chancellor has somewhat backfired. He is unsackable because of this, and the noises off, are more of a sign of an argument going his way rather than the way of the leakers. The Chancellor has backed leaving the single market and the customs union, but has stressed the protection of jobs in a transition period. He is backed across industry and finance by businesspeople for whom the sunny rhetoric of pro-Brexit Cabinet minister no longer cuts the mustard (if it ever did). These decision makers will have to make investment decisions at board meetings for their 2018/19 financial year in the coming weeks and months. That period includes the March 2019 likely date of Brexit, and therefore against a backdrop of this squabbling and of Cabinet ministers telling the EU to ""go whistle"" - they have to make judgements about the likelihood of a no deal Brexit. This domestic political chaos is of course noticed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. Where the PM had hoped for a cast iron strengthened hand in Brexit negotiations, she now struggles to maintain the unity of even her two dozen Cabinet ministers. The Government is consciously avoiding votes in the Commons and is attempting to limit the opportunity for votes to be brought by the Opposition and by backbench MPs too. It has also allowed Justine Greening to take from her capital budget to fund real terms protection for per capita schools spending in England. The recess cannot come quickly enough for the Government or the Prime Minister. Regroup and rest is the message. The danger is that the logic of leadership challenges will fester among a disgruntled Cabinet as they escape a torrid few months of politics. A period of political silence might well benefit the Government, but it cannot last, particularly as Brexit negotiations continue next month."

There is intense jostling for position as the would-be successors to the mortally wounded Mrs May - Boris Johnson, David Davis, Philip Hammond - stake their claim to her crown and knife each other (look to the anti-Hammond briefings over the weekend). But there is also a more substantive issue that is fuelling these tensions around what sort of Brexit Britain fights for over the next 18 months. Around the Cabinet table the splits of the referendum campaign are re-opening. Leading Brexiteers Mr Johnson and Michael Gove worry that key Remainer Mr Hammond is using the indecisive election result to frustrate, or at least soften, Brexit by pushing for a business-friendly exit. It has engulfed the Cabinet in all-out war, with leaking and finger pointing at fever pitch. One senior Tory on the Remain side of the debate has told me he believes Mr Johnson and Mr Gove were behind the attacks on Mr Hammond. Obsessed by a hard Brexit, ""they are prepared to run the economy off a cliff"" said the source, adding that the two Brexiteers are irked by the Chancellor's insistence that the Tories will put victory at the next election at risk if they push for an ""ideological"" Brexit over an ""economic"" one. Of course the Tory party has been here before. There were the wilderness years at the turn of the millennium - the Iain Duncan Smith and William Hague period - when the infighting became so bitter that Michael Howard was installed as a caretaker leader to re-unify the party. The infighting evokes memories of the embattled premiership of Sir John Major, who became so worn down by the running battles over Europe that he resigned (and was re-elected Tory leader) in a bid to silence his critics; The Tories then lost the next three elections. Mrs May's spokesperson tried to re-assert her authority, insisting the Prime Minister will put a lid back on the bubbling tensions after astonishing Cabinet leaks over the weekend. She might not find much support around her Cabinet table, but in the bowels of the backbenches, MPs are growing increasingly exasperated by the manoeuvrings of more senior colleagues. One MP has told me he wants to see Mrs May to ""get a grip"" and warned the continuous infighting only served to propel Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn closer to No 10. So, with the support of the parliamentary party, and crucially the chair of the 1922 backbench committee Graham Brady, Mrs May won't face an imminent leadership challenge. But what happens when the meat is put on to the bones of the Brexit deal - the cost of the divorce, the compromise of citizens' rights, the transition arrangements? Hopelessly divided already, it's easy to see how Mrs May's Conservatives could implode over the nuts and bolts of Brexit. After a bruising couple of months, the summer recess can't come soon enough for the PM. But it can only offer some brief respite from those Cabinet wars.

In a letter to hundreds of retired detectives, deputy commissioner Craig Mackey wrote: ""The nature of the response is placing certain skills in high demand, particularly across the investigative, counter terrorism and firearms commands. ""If you have considered the scope for a time-limited return to the Met in any capacity - either as a police officer, civilian investigator or volunteer (either warranted or non-warranted) - we would of course be open to discussions with you."" Mr Mackey says his letter was prompted by other retired officers who had already offered to return to work to help out. He wrote to 400 detective constables, who were either recently retired or on a career break, telling them: ""It is a significant ask and recognise that you will have moved on with your lives, but in the light of the contact we have had I wanted to let former colleagues know that we would consider such requests."" He added: ""Whether this be for a limited time or for the longer term, your support would be greatly appreciated during these unprecedented times."" Since the fire tragedy and terror attacks - along with the threat of further atrocities - the force is also having to deal with an increase in knife crime, motorbike thefts and, more recently, a spate of acid attacks. It is also having to find savings of £400m in the next three years as part of Government spending cuts and has struggled to maintain staff levels. London mayor Sadiq Khan has urged the Government to halt the cuts to the capital's police force. After the bombing of Manchester Arena in May, soldiers were deployed at London's major landmarks to assist armed police while the UK terror threat was briefly raised to its highest level. Last week, five acid attacks were carried out in north and east London within 90 minutes, adding to fears assaults involving the use of corrosive substances are on the rise in the capital. In the early hours of Sunday, a paramedic rushing to a 999 call had a noxious liquid thrown in her face."
2017-07-18,"Inmates in many jails are being kept in ""appalling"" conditions with not enough staff to maintain order, the prisons watchdog has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/prisons-watchdog-warns-of-staff-shortages-and-appalling-conditions-10952786,"Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales, said the ""seeming inability"" to keep drugs out of jails has been a major factor in declining safety standards. Mr Clarke said too many prisoners still do not have an adequate strategy to tackle the supply of drugs to inmates, while inspectors had seen many prisoners who were ""obviously"" under the influence of drugs during visits. And he was scathing about young offender institutions, revealing not a single one was deemed safe enough to hold children. The chief inspector also addressed the issue of the rapidly ageing prison population, suggesting secure ""old people's homes with walls"" could be built to house elderly criminals. The watchdog's annual report for 2016/17 said debt, bullying and self-segregation by prisoners are commonplace. ""This has all been compounded by staffing levels in many jails that are simply too low to keep order and run a decent regime that allows prisoners to be let out of their cells to get to training and education and have access to basic facilities,"" Mr Clarke said. ""When a person is sent to prison, the state accepts responsibility for their well-being, including their physical and mental health, safety and education. ""There is clear evidence that for too many prisoners, the state is failing in its duty."" Staffing levels have consistently been raised as an issue as violence and self-harm have surged to record levels. Assaults on staff increased by 38% last year, with a total of 6,844 incidents. Twenty-one out of 29 local and training prisons inspected were judged to be poor or ""not sufficiently good"" on safety. Mr Clarke, who described the response previous recommendations as ""unforgivably poor"", said the conditions in some jails were ""squalid, dirty and disgraceful"". He said: ""These figures suggest a serious deterioration in standards in our prisons, but they do not describe it. ""What is it like for prisoners on a day-to-day basis? During the course of the year I have often been appalled by the conditions in which we hold many prisoners."" According to the report there were numerous instances of men sharing a cell in which they are locked up for 23 hours a day, with prisoners pointing out insect and vermin infestations on several occasions. Expressing his dissatisfaction with efforts to improve standards, Mr Clarke said there was a ""huge gap"" between the watchdog's recommendations and achievements in prisons, leading to fears that ""lip service"" was being paid to them. Ministers launched a recruitment drive last year to add 2,500 frontline officers as part of an ambitious prison reform drive. At the end of March, there were 18,403 ""full-time equivalent"" staff in frontline categories, an increase of 75 on last year and 515 in the previous quarter. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We know that our prisons have faced a number of long-standing challenges, with annual increases in violence and self-inflicted deaths. ""That is why we have taken immediate action to boost prison officer numbers and put in place new measures to tackle drugs and mobile phones. ""The Justice Secretary has been clear that we need to create calm and ordered prison environments to help ensure effective rehabilitation, and that achieving this is his priority."""
2017-07-18,"The government's plans to introduce mandatory age verification for people visiting pornography websites could backfire and expose the UK to more cybercrime, experts have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/academics-doubt-value-of-online-porn-age-checks-10952614,"Academic researchers and technology experts have warned the measures - which come into effect in April 2018 - will not necessarily protect children from online pornography. Instead, the move could put government ministers and other high-profile figures at risk of blackmail if their embarrassing habits were observed by hackers. Jim Killock, the executive director at Open Rights Group, warned that ""age verification could lead to porn companies building databases of the UK's porn habits, which could be vulnerable to Ashley Madison style hacks."" ""The Government has repeatedly refused to ensure that there is a legal duty for age verification providers to protect the privacy of web users,"" he added. Adult websites are regularly targets for hackers due to the behaviour of their visitors, whom criminals might expect to be ashamed and therefore easier to scam. In 2015, adultery dating website Ashley Madison was hit by an enormous data breach, losing individuals' extremely sensitive data. The parent company behind that site this week settled with former users after a number of lawsuits, paying out $11.2m (£8.57m) on the grounds that it had not protected their data properly. Dr Victoria Nash of the Oxford Internet Institute, who was the lead author of a report on how to protect children online which was commissioned as the new checks were being developed, told Sky News she had questions regarding the law. She said: ""Database hacks are still common, and the information being collected across pornography sites could be stolen and used to blackmail politicians or other high-profile figures. ""Our report notably did not conclude that age verification would have a significant impact on children viewing pornography online. ""It may address the number of children stumbling across it, but it would not deter those who want to directly access it, nor will it address the issue of the coerced creation of images,"" she added. The law will also create a watchdog role which will be able to fine any pornography sites which fail to verify their visitors' ages. Non-compliant websites could even face being blocked by internet service providers. ""Age verification risks failure as it attempts to fix a social problem with technology,"" said Mr Killock. Dr Nash added: ""As a parent as well as a researcher, I'm proud that the UK does take child safety online seriously. ""I would like to see more of a focus on the social issues as well as the technology issues. ""This is not just about making websites harder to access, but about a very sexualised culture - children can come across very sexualised material in Game of Thrones and Rihanna videos - and about how our education system, and parenting should respond to that."""
2017-07-18,Tough new rules on gender stereotyping in advertising are being introduced to end outdated expectations of women cleaning and washing while men struggle to do basic domestic duties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/gender-stereotypes-to-be-banned-in-british-adverts-10952271,"These stereotypes can be harmful and help drive ""unfair outcomes"" particularly for younger people, according to research cited by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The report: Deceptions, Perceptions and Harm concludes a tougher line is needed on adverts which feature gender stereotyping. Report author Ella Smilie told Sky News: ""We know that depicting gender stereotypes in ads has the potential to reinforce expectations as to how groups or individuals should look or behave because of their gender - and that can have a potentially harmful effect on the way people consider their own aspirations and potential, as well as their expectations as to how others should behave."" The new standards will not stop all stereotyping but they will ban certain scenarios. For example, a woman with sole responsibility for clearing up family mess, a man failing to do basic household chores, or an advert suggesting an activity is inappropriate for boys or girls because it is often associated with the other sex. Ms Smilie added: ""Our focus is on ensuring ads don't mislead, harm or offend. ""So we'll be using everything we've learnt from this report to offer new standards, ensuring that new ads don't contain anything that could potentially be harmful. ""The industry will be using these standards to do what it does best - to create fantastic ads."" The issue is a hot topic within many advertising agencies who now realise that the days when the man took a leading role in adverts is long over. Jamie Williams, a partner at London-based Isobel, said: ""I think now we talk about this a lot and we understand it a lot. ""Certainly within our agency, looking at roles within the content we produce is really important so are we reflecting society accurately, who are, what is the make up of our cast."" The new standards will come into force next year and any ad in breach of the rules will be withdrawn. Many have welcomed the decision to strengthen the existing regulations. Psychologist Emma Kenny said: ""We need to regulate marketing and advertising standards so that they start to represent the reality of what it's like to be a human being. ""And that means removing the restrictions that they place, funneling girls down one route funneling boys down the other because ultimately the majority of individuals fall somewhere in between. ""It is the marketers that have created those gender stereotypes."""
2017-07-18,Extra charges for customers who pay for goods or services with credit or debit cards are to be outlawed from next year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/rip-off-473m-credit-and-debit-card-surcharges-will-be-banned-10953421,"It will bring an end to levies of up to 20% on consumers paying for products such as flights or takeaways just because they use a card. The new rules also cover charges levied by local councils and Government agencies such as the DVLA. The Treasury estimates the total value of such surcharges at £473m a year. But there was a warning that some retailers could raise prices for all to compensate for missing out on the charges. Stephen Barclay, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News that consumers feel ""very cross"" when, for example, booking a flight that costs £24.99 only to be hit with an additional £5 charge at the end of the process. He batted off concerns that the new rules could add to the expense facing small retailers, saying they are already ""used to"" absorbing other costs such as business rates. The changes, due to take effect from January, are being applied as the result of an EU directive. The Treasury said the directive banned such charges being levied by Visa and Mastercard but that it had gone further, extending it to cover other card and payment providers such as Amex, PayPal and Apple Pay. Businesses usually say they add on the charges to cover the cost of processing card payments. The Government said that while many industries had acted to absorb these costs and not passed them on to consumers, the new rules would bring an end to the practice entirely. It said it had previously capped the costs that businesses - including small shops as well as larger businesses - face for processing card payments, and would engage with retailers ""to assess if there is any more that can be done to help"". Mr Barclay said: ""Rip-off charges have no place in a modern Britain and that's why card charging in Britain is about to come to an end. ""This is about fairness and transparency, and so from next year there will be no more nasty surprises for people at the check-out just for using a card. ""These small changes can really add up and this change will mean shoppers across the country have that bit of extra cash to spend on the things that matter to them."" Consumer group Which?, which has been campaigning for years to end card surcharges, welcomed the announcement. Which? money expert Gareth Shaw said: ""These new rules will finally put an end to this unfair practice."" Guy Anker, managing director of MoneySavingExpert.com, said it was good news for consumers but added: ""We expect some companies will raise prices for all to compensate for the loss."""
2017-07-18,"The rate of inflation fell unexpectedly to 2.6% in June from 2.9% the previous month, led by lower oil prices.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/inflation-falls-unexpectedly-to-26-as-oil-costs-sink-10952457,"The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), are significant as they show not only an easing in the squeeze on living costs but also take pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates to combat rising prices. But Bank governor Mark Carney told Sky News that the ""big picture"" on inflation remained the same, with the main driver still the fall in sterling since last June's Brexit vote. ""That's what's pushing inflation up, and inflation will be above target for a period of time and today's figures are consistent with that,"" Mr Carney said. The pound tumbled by more than a cent against the euro to below €1.13 on the inflation figures while it also slipped back versus the dollar to near the $1.30 mark, despite the US currency's weakness amid political uncertainty in Washington. Sterling's recent strengthening against the dollar, to levels not seen since last September, has been partly down to increased expectations of a hike in the Bank rate from its record low of 0.25%. It has also been a factor in helping oil costs, priced in dollars, fall. Those lower oil prices are then reflected at the petrol pump. Jonanthan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician, said: ""Today's fall in inflation is mainly due to drops in petrol and diesel prices. However, the rate remains higher than in the recent past."" The ONS said an easing in the cost of computer games and equipment, which contributed to rising inflation in May, also helped bring the rate down last month. Economists had largely expected inflation to remain static in June - perhaps even hit 3% - as prices continue to feel the effects of weaker sterling since the EU referendum which has pushed up import costs. It has meant that those increases, when passed on to consumers, raise their bills at a time when wage growth is under pressure. That squeeze on household budgets does appear to have eased - at least temporarily - with the ONS measuring wage growth, excluding bonuses, at an annual rate of 2% in May. :: Low rates mean £1,000 worth £878 a decade on Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the surprise figures substantially reduced the likelihood of an August interest rate rise. The news sent the pound sharply lower as currency traders adjusted their outlook for interest rates. The Bank of England's rhetoric has taken an increasingly hawkish tone in recent weeks, with Mark Carney himself saying at the end of last month that ""some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary"". Rate hike expectations first grew last month when it emerged three members of the Bank's monetary policy committee had supported raising borrowing costs by 0.25% - but were outvoted. While one of those policymakers, Kristin Forbes, has since left the committee the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane has since also expressed his willingness to change tack."

He made the claim after Sky News established that the BRE wrote a report saying there was no case for regulating toxic smoke from plastic insulation, at the same time as being paid by plastic insulation companies. Sky News revealed last month that the insulation on Grenfell Tower gave off deadly hydrogen cyanide gas, and at least three victims had been treated for cyanide poisoning. There are currently no regulations on the volume of smoke produced by insulation or the danger it can pose. BRE was recruited by the European Commission ""to evaluate the need to regulate… on the toxicity of smoke produced by construction products in fires"". Its final draft report says ""there would be limited benefits"" from any new regulations, which could ""increase costs"". It concludes that its study found no agreed case for regulating toxic smoke, which could ""potentially remove some products from the market"". BRE, a UK charity with a £48m turnover, is paid for fire testing by some of the biggest foam insulation manufacturers. During the study, BRE consulted at least a dozen plastics industry associations, lobby groups and individuals, several of which represent firms that also pay BRE for commercial testing and development. Despite the number of industry participants, the minutes of the study's first meeting record the expanded polystyrene lobby group EUMEPS complaining there could be ""an under-representation of sectors that might be most affected by additional testing requirements e.g. plastics"". Professor Hull, who was part of the study team as an independent expert, has accused BRE of having an ""unhealthy"" mixture of commercial and advisory roles. He said: ""I was disappointed when I heard BRE would be leading the study, I thought it would be a more neutral player. ""I think they depend very heavily on a large amount of testing of effectively combustible materials… so I think there is a conflict of interest there."" Sky News has previously revealed concerns from a lawyer acting for some of the Grenfell Tower victims about key BRE figures appointed by the Government to give building safety advice since the disaster. Jolyon Maugham QC said BRE trustee Sir Ken Knight and chief executive Peter Bonfield were ""tainted by association"" through their links to advice given to ministers last year that combustible material on tower blocks was acceptable because building controls were ""adequate"". BRE also sells access to an improved set of fire safety standards that could have prevented the Grenfell Tower disaster while advising the Government on building regulations. The head of the Fire Protection Association, Jonathan O'Neill, told Sky News that the improved standards address shortcomings in the statutory regulations that Grenfell Tower relied on. DG Grow, the Brussels department that commissioned the smoke toxicity study, said the final report from BRE is yet to be delivered. A spokesman added: ""Any action on smoke toxicity at European level will be subject to the normal consultation and decision making process."" BRE has not responded to a request for comment."

I didn't know what was going to happen to me,"" she said. ""It all happened very quickly - one of them threw liquid out of a plastic bottle at me.

They toured the site, which is now a museum, meeting senior staff and signing a visitors book before being taken to a barracks and shown shoes left by Holocaust victims. The couple left a message, saying: ""We were intensely moved by our visit to Stutthof, which has been the scene of so much terrible pain, suffering and death. ""This shattering visit has reminded us of the horrendous murder of six million Jews, drawn from across the whole of Europe, who died in the abominable Holocaust. ""It is, too, a terrible reminder of the cost of war. And the fact that Poland alone lost millions of its people, who were the victims of a most brutal occupation."" Afterwards, the Royal couple met survivors of the camp, including two Britons who were returning for the first time. They listened while Zigi Shipper and Manfred Goldberg, both 87, led a prayer. The survivors became lifelong friends after being detained aged 14 and rescued together in 1945. They later resettled in north London. Mr Goldberg said before the visit that it would be a ""seismic event"" because, having never set foot in Germany or Poland since the camp's liberation, ""I decided that I really had to face the past"". After the camp visit, the Royals travelled to Gdansk to join a street party, before going on a short tour of the city's Shakespeare Theatre. Prince George, three, and Princess Charlotte, two, travelled to Poland with their parents for the five-day tour but did not join them at the camp.

The clinical meeting between US doctor Michio Hirano and an international colleague of his, together with a UK expert in mitochondrial disease, an independent chair and the baby's mother, Connie Yates, is now over. The second international specialist cannot be named for legal reasons. A lawyer representing Great Ormond Street Hospital said at the latest court hearing on Friday that the clinicians' meeting would be easier if the parents did not attend in order for the experts to have a full and open discussion. However, the judge allowed Charlie's mother to attend the meeting after her lawyer argued she had carried out extensive research into her son's condition and was informed enough to contribute and listen to doctors' perspectives. Ahead of the meeting, Great Ormond Street said Ms Yates' contribution would be welcome and would be supported by the chair who could introduce her questions and ensure adequate time is offered to respond. The Great Ormond Street clinicians currently caring for Charlie were also attending. They included a consultant paediatric intensivist, a consultant paediatric neurologist, a consultant in paediatric metabolic medicine and a consultant neuroradiologist. It is the first time for visiting clinicians to contribute with the benefit of having examined Charlie and viewed the 11-month-old's medical records and most recent scans. His parents want to take their son to the US for an experimental therapy overseen by Dr Hirano, who examined Charlie on Monday.

2017-07-18,There's no doubt Theresa May is still fighting for her political life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/five-ways-jeremy-corbyn-could-take-power-10944658,"The Prime Minister is battling on a number of fronts, with some saying her leadership and credibility are in tatters. Her Conservative minority government - propped up by the DUP - is in a fragile position and faces many challenges in Parliament - not least on Britain's exit from the European Union. But has her election disaster left the door open for Jeremy Corbyn to enter Number 10? We take a look at several scenarios which could precipitate another general election in which the Labour leader could take power. :: Losing a key vote Mrs May's gamble of a snap election to win a Brexit mandate horribly backfired, leaving her with a working majority of just 13 - 10 of those votes reliant on the Democratic Unionist Party's lawmakers. It only takes seven Conservative MPs to turn a rebellion into a loss of majority for the Government and the DUP - or even a small number of absences through illness or travel delays. This would also require a considerable amount of planning on the part of the opposition parties to organise a potential defeat of a key legislative Bill by ganging up on the Tories and DUP - but it is plausible. Key manifesto pledges to change the triple lock on pensions, to means-test the winter fuel allowance and bring back fox hunting and grammar schools have already been sacrificed to see off such a threat. Labour has claimed Mrs May's programme is in ""tatters"". ""Theresa May does not have a mandate for continued cuts to our schools, hospitals, police and other vital public services or for a race-to-the-bottom Brexit,"" Mr Corbyn was warned. ""Labour will fight these policies every step of the way."" :: Vote of no confidence The Conservative Party is ruthless with losers - and the PM's benches will be watching her performance closely following her botched election campaign. While some Tories have called for calm, warning the party needs another leadership election ""like a hole in the head"", rivals may wait for Mrs May's not so strong and stable leadership to fail. Only 15% of Tory MPs would need to back a no confidence vote in the Prime Minister to trigger a leadership contest - this means just 48 members of her minority government turning against her. Even if this were to happen, it does not mean an immediate election. The nation did not go to the polls when Mrs May replaced David Cameron last year. In addition, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act remains in place - which means a two-thirds vote of the House of Commons is required to secure an early dissolution - so both main parties need to be on side for it to happen. In other words, a majority of MPs must pass a motion saying ""this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government"". Given Labour's recent surge in the polls and Mr Corbyn's rising popularity making him the favourite to win, why would the Conservatives - or a new Tory PM - want another election anytime in the near future? All parties would have two weeks to form another government. If that failed, another election would be called. In any case, Mrs May's downfall, however, would set off a chain of events making another election inevitable. :: Could Brexit trigger an early election? Well, it triggered the June poll! Mrs May's catastrophic gamble to win a Brexit mandate has left her party split over the issue. While the Cabinet Brexiteers have been boosted by the return of Michael Gove, Tory Remainers have been flexing their muscles since the election result and there are growing doubts whether her version of a ""hard"" Brexit will happen at all. She is facing a wider bid to water down her Brexit plans by a cross-party group set up to fight against a ""hard"" Brexit. The all-party parliamentary group on EU relations is co-chaired by Chuka Umunna, who recently led a Labour revolt over Brexit by calling for the UK to stay in the single market, and prominent Remain campaigner and Conservative MP Anna Soubry. The Repeal Bill - which will replicate all existing EU law into British law by the time of Britain's departure from the EU - is expected to be tabled when Parliament returns in the autumn and will provide a crucial test for the Government's ability to get key measures through. In addition, she is also facing pressure over her plan to quit Europe's nuclear regulator Euratom because it is under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - whose influence over the UK she has highlighted as a ""red line"" in her Brexit negotiations. At least nine Tory MPs have indicated they are against this, and according to Sky's Political Editor Faisal Islam, on this issue, at least, the implications appear toxic for the Prime Minister's chance of a majority. Mr Corbyn is facing splits in his own party over Brexit as well - highlighted earlier this month when 49 Labour MPs defied him and party policy by voting in favour of an amendment tabled by Mr Umunna calling for Britain to remain in the single market. But it is Mrs May who is in the driving seat (at least for now) and in her own words, facing ""a different reality"" a year on since becoming Tory leader, and her plea to Mr Corbyn and Labour to come to her aid on Brexit has fallen on deaf ears. Mr Corbyn has rejected and mocked her appeal for cross-party cooperation on government policy making, and instead demanded a fresh election if her government has run out of ideas. :: The Democratic Unionist Party walks away The confidence and supply deal worth £1.5bn agreed with the Conservatives means the DUP's 10 MPs will support the Government on key votes in the Commons - including the event of a no confidence vote. The pact prevents Mrs May's minority government from being ""ambushed"" - as described by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The deal is not binding - unlike the formal 2010 coalition between the Tories and Liberal Democrats. However, it is in the interests of the Northern Irish parliamentary kingmakers to keep their part of the deal and prop up Mrs May's premiership. Under the arrangement, about £1bn in ""new money"" has been earmarked for Northern Ireland, as well as greater flexibility over £500m already allocated to the country. Mrs May has survived several crucial Commons tests already - including a majority vote for her Queen's Speech - thanks to the DUP's support. The DUP has also reportedly pledged to support Mrs May's government ""for as long as Jeremy Corbyn is leader of the Labour Party"". The likelihood of Mr Corbyn being ousted on the back of a significant post-election boost for Labour is slim. :: Another General Election The most likely way Mr Corbyn could enter Number 10 is if there was a fresh election. Just hours after the June poll results were declared, Mr Corbyn called on Mrs May to resign, declaring he was ""ready to serve the country"". It is impossible to say how long the PM will last at Number 10. Minority administrations have an unhappy history and Mrs May will be wary of the fate that has befallen others before her, including the cricket-loving former PM John Major who also relied on the support of Ulster Unionist Party MPs. In 1992, Mr Major won a majority of 21, but found himself leading a minority government from December 1996 due to a combination of by-election losses and defections. His minority government limped on until May 1997 when the Conservatives were swept away in a landslide by Tony Blair's Labour, sealing Mr Major's fate. Mrs May said at almost every election campaign rally that if she lost just six seats she would have lost the election. In the end her party recorded a net loss of 13 seats. Mr Corbyn's Labour surged to 261 seats - up 29 from its tally in the 2015 election. She is still in Downing Street, but her minority government does not wield much power. If key legislation is repeatedly voted down in Parliament, the country could be going to the polls again very soon, with Mr Corbyn odds-on favourite to become the next PM."
2017-07-18,"Two thirds of the on-screen talent at the BBC earning more than £150,000 per year are men, BBC figures are expected to reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/bbc-top-earnings-expected-to-show-gender-gap-10953475,"The salaries, to be published for the first time today, will show a gender pay gap among some of the Corporation's top earners. The BBC will publish the list of highly paid presenters and journalists as part of a disclosure ordered by the Government. The list is thought to include presenters Chris Evans, Fiona Bruce and Graham Norton, as well as journalists such as BBC News political editor Laura Kuenssberg and Radio 4's Today programme presenter John Humphrys. The names will be made public as part of the BBC Annual Report & Accounts publication. While the BBC has published senior management pay for many years, this is the first time it has done so for on screen or on air talent. Damian Collins MP, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, told Sky News: ""This could be a really serious issue. ""If it becomes clear that people doing the same job with the same level of experience but being paid at very different levels, people will question why that can be the case. ""There has been concern raised that we may see examples of this. ""This would certainly be a very serious matter. ""This would certainly be something we would take up very strongly with the BBC when the director general and the chairman appear before the select committee in the autumn."" Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron's former director of communications and ex-BBC News executive, said the Corporation could be facing ""an inherent sexism issue"" if figures reveal gender pay differences. He told Sky News: ""I've heard anecdotally that some female presenters are paid less than men who are doing the equivalent job. ""The people who decide those salaries will come up with all sorts of reasons for that but when it's down in black and white that becomes a profound issue. ""People are going to say that's a problem and ask if there is an inherent sexism issue. ""I think it is right that people get to see the figures."" Of the 43,000 talent contracts with the BBC last year, around a quarter of one per cent were paid more than £150,000, they said. And the bill for top talent was down 10% year on year, and down by a quarter over the last five years, according to BBC figures. Cat Lewis, chief executive of Nine Lives Media, a production company which makes programmes for the BBC, believes revealing presenters' salaries could damage the corporation. ""Whilst I understand the need to be transparent with licence payers money, I don't think this is going to help the BBC. ""It will make it enormously difficult for them to remain competitive and could mean they cannot retain talent. That's going to be bad for programme making."" A spokesman for the BBC said it was spending less on individual talent now than ever before."
2017-07-18,"Up to 2,000 women who say they suffered complications from vaginal mesh implants are planning to take group legal action against the manufacturers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/legal-action-launched-for-vaginal-mesh-sufferers-10952224,"The TVT mesh is often prescribed to women who experience incontinence after childbirth and involves inserting a plastic mesh into the vagina to support the bladder. While the operation can be a success, it has left some women in chronic pain, unable to walk, work or have sexual intercourse. Julie Gilsenan, a 41 year-old paramedic, had the operation in February after being told it was the best way to cure her mild incontinence. The mother of five said she now struggles to walk very far and has to take five types of medication every day to relieve her constant pain. ""The operation was described as routine, lasted 20 minutes and it has ruined my life,"" she said. ""Immediately afterwards I started to get immense sharp glass-like pain on one side of my groin. ""It started to develop into pain across my pelvis, backache, and it's so draining. ""It doesn't matter how much medication I take the pain is still there. ""It's like Russian roulette. ""Anyone who knew me would tell you that before the surgery I was always on the go, I never sat still and I was a happy person. ""This mesh operation has changed everything for me."" The procedure has also meant Ms Gilsenan must self-catheterise to empty her bladder, something which means she can no longer work as a paramedic on the front line. She said: ""It's not only my home life but it's the financial impact too. ""I was told this was the best thing for me, I trusted the advice given to me. ""If I'd have known the extent it would change my life, that I couldn't work and do the things I used to do with my family, there is absolutely no way I would have agreed to have the surgery."" The mesh itself is usually made out of synthetic polypropylene and used to treat incontinence or prolapse, conditions that have often, but not always, been caused by childbirth. Between 2006 and 2016, more than 92,000 women in England were treated with a polypropylene surgical material that is either inserted as a mesh patch or a vaginal tape, known as TVT, TVTO and TOT. Up to 2000 women are planning to take legal action against manufacturers of the mesh, arguing that it is not fit for purpose. David Golten, partner at Wedlake Bell LLP, is one of those representing the women. He said: ""If all of the allegations are proved then it could well be the biggest health scandal of our time, given the number of women involved and the fact that, if the allegations are proved, it would suggest that people knew that this device was going wrong and continued to use it and continued to make it."" One of the biggest makers of mesh implants is US pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson. In response to litigation its subsidiary, Ethicon said: ""Ethicon will vigorously defend itself in lawsuits concerning the use of our pelvic mesh products. ""The evidence will show that Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the research, development and marketing of its pelvic mesh products."" Two years after Sky News first reported the issue, nearly 100 women will attend a summit in Parliament on Tuesday hosted by Pontypridd MP Owen Smith. They are calling on the government to suspend the mesh procedure in England, pending further research. Speaking ahead of the lobby, Owen Smith said: ""In seven years of being an MP, this is one of the worst medical issues I have come across. ""That's why I am hosting this summit in Parliament to hear from women and experts about the risks involved with mesh surgery. ""It is my hope that the Government will take action to address this growing issue and immediately review Mesh treatment."""
2017-07-18,"The next generation £10 note has been shown off by the governor of the Bank of England, to a certain degree of controversy.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170719024624/http://news.sky.com/story/coming-soon-to-your-wallet-new-10-note-unveiled-10952602,"The polymer currency - designed to be more durable and difficult to counterfeit - will start to replace the old paper versions from 14 September. Current tenners featuring Charles Darwin will be withdrawn next spring. It follows the release of the new £5 note last year - later marred by an outcry among animal rights and vegan campaigners over the use of tallow, a suet derivative, in its manufacture. While the new tenner also contains the animal fat product, the Bank says it is still seeking ways to replace it in future. The central bank walked into a further row about the new £10 notes before they even enter circulation. It concerns claims by biographers that the image of Austen to be used on the currency from a portrait had been doctored to make her look more pretty. There were also murmurings over the Bank's use, in the design, of a quote from Pride and Prejudice that reads: ""I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!"". Literary experts pointed out the words were spoken by a character in the book with clearly no interest in reading - Caroline Bingley. Unveiling the note, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: ""£10 would have meant a lot to Jane Austen - about the same as £1000 would mean to us today."" That was based on figures showing how much prices had gone up since the year of Austen's birth in 1775. Mr Carney also said £10 may have had a ""symbolic meaning"" for the author as it was the amount paid by publishers Crosby and Co for her first novel, Susan. The governor was speaking at an event to launch the note at Winchester Cathedral, where the Regency-era author is buried, marking the 200th anniversary of her death. The Bank says the latest polymer note in its stable is its best yet, including a new feature to help the blind identify it. Also included is a 3D hologram of the coronation crown that changes colour when the note is tilted. Mr Carney said: ""Our banknotes serve as repositories of the country's collective memory, promoting awareness of the United Kingdom's glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens. ""The new £10 note celebrates Jane Austen's work. Austen's novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published. ""The new £10 will be printed on polymer, making it safer, stronger and cleaner. The note will also include a new tactile feature on the £10 to help the visually impaired, ensuring the nation's money is as inclusive as possible."""

After the shoemaker and teacher did not return, their seven children - five sons and two daughters - were separated and placed with other families. Marceline Udry-Dumoulin was their youngest daughter. Now 79 years old, she told Swiss newspaper Le Matin: ""We spent our whole lives looking for them, without stopping. ""We thought that we could give them the funeral they deserved one day."" Police in the canton of Valais said two bodies with identity papers were found by a worker near a ski lift on the Tsanfleuron glacier last week. They were discovered 2,615m (8,600ft) above the Les Diablerets resort. DNA testing is expected to be carried out to confirm their identities. Bernhard Tschannen, the director of a local cable car and ski lift company, told Swiss media: ""The bodies were lying near each other. ""It was a man and a woman wearing clothing dating from the period of World War Two. ""They were perfectly preserved in the glacier and their belongings were intact."" Ms Udry-Dumoulin said it was unusual for her mother to accompany her father on such a trip, explaining: ""She was always pregnant and couldn't climb in the difficult conditions of a glacier."" She and her siblings all remained in the region but gradually become strangers. ""For the funeral, I won't wear black,"" she added. ""I think that white would be more appropriate. It represents hope, which I never lost. ""I can say that after 75 years of waiting this news gives me a deep sense of calm."" Officials say 280 people have been listed as missing in the Alps or rivers of the Valais since 1925."

On Sunday, some 2.8 million vehicles are expected to head out on holiday, or for a day trip. The RAC is predicting 37 million leisure trips in total for the first two weeks of the school holidays. The times to avoid this weekend - if possible - are: :: Friday 21 July - 1pm to 8pm :: Saturday 22 July - 11am to 4pm :: Sunday 23 July - 11am to 4pm Families hoping to begin their holiday by driving off into the sun could also be disappointed.

RAC spokesman Rod Dennis warned of the ""customary chaos"" on certain stretches of road and urged drivers to summon a healthy dose of patience. ""The very-much-needed family summer holiday might begin stressfully as long tailbacks are inevitable, particularly in the South West on the M5, which is the main conduit to the beaches of Devon and Cornwall,"" said Mr Dennis. The most congested roads are predicted to be: :: M5 Almondsbury Interchange and from Bristol to Taunton :: A30 and A38 Exeter to Cornwall :: A303 Andover to Ilminster :: M4 between Cardiff and Swansea :: M25 between Gatwick and M1 :: A23/M23 to Brighton :: A34 and M3 south and southwest to the south coast :: A47 Swaffham to Great Yarmouth :: A11 Thetford to Norwich :: M55 between Preston and Blackpool :: A14 between the Midlands and the east coast :: A590/A591 between the M6 and the Lake District :: A66 between the M6 and the coast :: M53 between Liverpool and Chester More than 200 roadworks on motorways and A-roads are also planned, although Highways England said much of the work would be carried out overnight. :: The RAC figures are based on analysis of the travel plans of 3,176 motorists."

Authorities in Minneapolis, where the shooting occurred, have not given any details about what happened. The two officers' body cams were not switched on and footage from the police car failed to capture the incident. Don Damond, who is Ms Damond's fiance, said the family had almost no information about what had happened. He said: ""We've lost the dearest of people and we're desperate for information.

Police Chief Janee Harteau said that she has ""many of the same questions"" as Ms Damond's family. She said: ""I've asked for the investigation to be expedited to provide transparency and to answer as many questions as quickly as we can."" Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman will decide whether the officers should be charged in relation to the shooting after an investigation. Mr Freeman has not commented on the case except to say that the officers should have switched on their cameras when Ms Damond approached them. The officer who fired at Ms Damond was Mohamed Noor, a Somali-American who joined the police department in March 2015.

Daniel Stilitz QC said earlier this month that the case was brought to make sure the union ""does not seek to breach the law again"". He said that given the importance of maintaining discipline and security within the prisons service, Parliament had enacted a prohibition on inducing prison officers to strike under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Despite this, the union had recently called or threatened to call industrial action a number of times, Mr Stilitz told the court. ""Any inducement which leads prison officers to cease to provide services which they otherwise would have done is unlawful,"" he said. Mr Stilitz argued the union had shown a continued willingness to call for industrial action despite Parliament having ""clearly and deliberately"" prohibited it from doing so, accusing the POA of using ""inflammatory rhetoric"". He said: ""The Secretary of State is concerned that, unless the position is determined definitively by the court, there will be renewed calls for unlawful industrial action in the future. ""It is therefore critical to safeguarding the proper and safe functioning of the prison service that the scope of the statutory prohibition is confirmed."" John Hendy QC, representing the POA, said each of the activities referred to were voluntary in nature and there was no evidence that any of its 35,000 members had been asked to disobey any lawful instruction. Mr Hendy said efforts were made to make sure members fully complied with the February order and the court was being asked to consider the lawfulness of a circular which was no longer in existence and was never implemented. Announcing his judgement, Mr Justice Jay said the Ministry of Justice was entitled to a final injunction. He said: ""The POA has lost not just on the facts - the wording of the circular, and the finding that the circular was likely to generate a risk to the safety of prisoners and staff - but also on the important point of principle."""
2017-07-19,"Powerful and addictive prescription drugs are illegally being offered for sale on Facebook, a Sky News investigation has discovered.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170720032142/http://news.sky.com/story/sky-news-investigation-prescription-drugs-sold-illegally-on-facebook-10954575,"And the US social media giant has been refusing to remove accounts even when users have reported them. Drugs including Valium, Xanax and Pregabalin, an increasingly popular sedative linked to several deaths in the UK, were on offer. Opioids responsible in the USA for a huge rise in drug abuse over recent years - were also available. The Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told Sky News that the availability of sedatives, tranquilisers and opioids on the platform ""completely changes the game"". Danny Lee-Frost, head of enforcement at the MHRA, told Sky News: ""The sleeping pills and antidepressants are a lot more dangerous. ""People have committed suicide as the ultimate resort to try and get off them. These are fiercely addictive."" Facebook's own Community Standards say: ""We prohibit any attempts by unauthorised dealers to purchase, sell or trade prescription drugs, marijuana, firearms or ammunition."" And: ""We prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organise criminal activity."" Sky News initially reported the accounts using Facebook's tools. Each account was allowed to remain. Messages from Facebook Support said: ""We've looked over the profile you reported, and although it doesn't go against any of our specific Community Standards, we understand that the profile or something the person shared may still be offensive to you."" Sky News then contacted Facebook's press office to ask why the accounts didn't apparently breach their community standards, even though they broke British law. After we contacted Facebook for comment, all the drug dealing profiles were removed. The company refused our request for an interview but gave us this statement: ""Buying, selling, or trading prescription drugs isn't allowed on Facebook and we urge people to use our reporting tools if they come across this kind of activity, so we can investigate and take swift action. ""We're grateful to Sky News for flagging this content to us and have removed the pages for breaking our standards."" However, Sky News was still easily able to discover dozens more drug dealing accounts on the platform. Sky News spoke with one drug dealer, based in Cameroon and sending deliveries to the UK, who said he'd been using Facebook to sell prescription drugs ""for three to four years"". ""It's easier for me to work (on Facebook),"" he told us. Had he ever been trouble with Facebook? ""No, no."" Does Facebook care? ""No."" Sky News also found more traditional recreational drugs for sale, including Ketamine, cannabis and MDMA. Danny Lee-Frost, head of enforcement at the Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, told Sky News that the rise in sedatives on the web was worrying. ""We've always seen anabolic steroids on the web. ""But we are now seeing a lot more sleeping tablets, seeing a lot more anti-anxieties, diazepam and benzo-diazepam, those types of products, being available. ""The sleeping pills and antidepressants are a lot more dangerous, they're a lot more addictive. ""That's the reason they're prescription only. ""That changes the game completely."" Facebook relies on its 2 billion users to flag illegal or inappropriate content. But the company has faced criticism for failing to remove accounts, whether for drugs, extremism or abuse. Earlier this year, the chair of the Home Affairs Committee, Yvette Cooper MP, said: ""Social media companies' failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace."""

The executions are said to be staged in markets, sports stadiums and on school grounds, while state killings are also carried out in prison camps ""as a means of inciting fear and intimidation among potential escapees"". TJWG, a non-governmental organisation based in Seoul, said its findings were based on interviews with 375 North Korean defectors over two years. While interviewees said most executions were carried out by firing squads, others revealed that detainees could be beaten to death as ""some crimes were considered not worth wasting bullets on"". In one case, a suspect was forced to dig his own grave, before being beaten to death and buried, the report said. Interviewees said that in many instances the final decision for a public execution was influenced by suspects having a ""bad"" family background. Others reported a spate of executions shortly after state decrees, in order to create ""an atmosphere of fear around certain behaviours the government wishes to emphasise as unacceptable"". Meanwhile, the report also detailed abuses including large prison camps, systematic torture, starvation and executions comparable to Nazi-era atrocities. TJWG said its findings could be used in future investigations into crimes against humanity in North Korea. ""It is also essential for connecting families with the remains of loved ones who may have disappeared or been killed and buried in unknown locations by agents of the state,"" it added. In June, American student Otto Warmbier died days after being released from a North Korean prison. Despite this, the authoritarian regime has launched a website offering holiday options to foreigners, ranging from surfing to rice planting. The DPR Korea Tour website includes package trips to capital Pyongyang and ""theme tours"" around other parts of the country. The site claims surfing ""has come into vogue among tourists"" on the east coast's Majon Bathing Beach."

Mrs May has been told she will have the backing of senior backbenchers to get rid of any ministers who are found to be plotting against her. MP Charles Walker, a vice chairman of the 1922 committee, has told Sky News the plotters should ""zip it"", or else the party will ""skip a generation"" when it comes to picking Mrs May's successor. Speaking as Parliament prepares to break up for the summer, the PM told LBC Radio: ""There is no such thing as an unsackable minister, but at the moment the team is together and we are getting on with the job of delivering what we need to do."" Pressed by presenter Iain Dale over whether any minister was unsackable, she replied: ""No."" Mrs May was asked whether the willingness of her ministers to leak what was said around the Cabinet table showed her authority was shot after her General Election gamble backfired. She replied: ""I have to say, I think if you look back over the years, you will find that this has sadly not been the only instance when people say things out of Cabinet. It shouldn't happen and it is important that we accept collective responsibility."" Mrs May continued: ""(For) all of us in government, it is a huge privilege, but it also brings a responsibility and part of that responsibility is about doing the job we have to do. ""We have important policies to deliver for the public, there are some big issues we have got to deal with - Brexit, of course, being one of them."" She said her message at Cabinet on Tuesday - when she warned ministers they need to show ""strength and unity"" - was that ""we need to ensure that we can get on with that work that we need to do to deliver for people and ... that means the Government being together."" Mrs May added: ""We have a very simple approach in this country that things said at these Cabinet meetings shouldn't be reported publicly in that way, and people should accept collective responsibility. When decisions are taken, they are Government decisions."" The PM also admitted the Conservatives have ""a job to do"" to win over young voters, who Jeremy Corbyn was widely acknowledged with enthusing during the election campaign. ""We have a job to do in getting that message across to people,"" she said. ""It's a message about jobs and what we are going to do on housing and reassuring young people and giving them confidence in their futures. ""I think a lot of young people do worry about what is going to happen, particularly on housing and what the jobs of the future are going to be and will they be given the skills to take those jobs up."" In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs May said she can ""completely understand"" people's concerns about the Democratic Unionist Party's attitude to gay rights. The PM relies on support from the Northern Irish party to prop up her minority government. Mrs May - the daughter of a vicar - also said the Church of England ""will want to reflect"" on whether to let the clergy bless gay marriages. And as MPs prepare to go off on their holidays for the summer, she revealed she will be heading for a walking holiday in the Alps."
2017-07-19,Extra charges for customers who pay for goods or services with credit or debit cards are to be outlawed from next year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170720032142/http://news.sky.com/story/rip-off-473m-credit-and-debit-card-surcharges-will-be-banned-10953421,"It will bring an end to levies of up to 20% on consumers paying for products such as flights or takeaways just because they use a card. The new rules also cover charges levied by local councils and Government agencies such as the DVLA. The Treasury estimates the total value of such surcharges at £473m a year. But there was a warning that some retailers could raise prices to compensate for missing out on the charges. Stephen Barclay, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News that consumers feel ""very cross"" when, for example, booking a flight that costs £24.99 only to be hit with an additional £5 charge at the end of the process. He batted off concerns that the new rules could add to the expense facing small retailers, saying they are already ""used to"" absorbing other costs such as business rates. The changes, due to take effect from January, are being applied as the result of an EU directive. The Treasury said the directive banned such charges being levied by Visa and Mastercard but that it had gone further, extending it to cover other card and payment providers such as Amex, PayPal and Apple Pay. Businesses usually say they add on the charges to cover the cost of processing card payments. The Government said that while many industries had acted to absorb these costs and not passed them on to consumers, the new rules would bring an end to the practice entirely. It said it had previously capped the costs that businesses - including small shops as well as larger businesses - face for processing card payments, and would engage with retailers ""to assess if there is any more that can be done to help"". Mr Barclay said: ""Rip-off charges have no place in a modern Britain and that's why card charging in Britain is about to come to an end. ""This is about fairness and transparency, and so from next year there will be no more nasty surprises for people at the check-out just for using a card. ""These small changes can really add up and this change will mean shoppers across the country have that bit of extra cash to spend on the things that matter to them."" Consumer group Which?, which has been campaigning for years to end card surcharges, welcomed the announcement. Which? money expert Gareth Shaw said: ""These new rules will finally put an end to this unfair practice."" Guy Anker, managing director of MoneySavingExpert.com, said it was good news for consumers but added: ""We expect some companies will raise prices for all to compensate for the loss."""

Bosses from Tesco, Jaguar Land Rover and National Grid are also due at the summit later, with the aim of providing a direct link between business and the Government's Brexit strategy. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Martin echoed growing recent demands from business saying that he would be asking Mrs May for ""more clarity and more certainty"" over the process. He told Sky News: ""At the minute our members are very unclear about what the plan is of the Government and where we're actually heading."" His comments came as an IoD survey of 1,000 firms revealed that while the majority had made contingency plans for Brexit, only one in 10 had started to implement them. The IoD said the figures revealed a ""window of opportunity"" to save these companies from having to make big changes that could damage the UK economy. It said the figures showed that there was ""still plenty of opportunity for the Government to persuade them that our exit from the EU will be smooth"". Mr Martin said: ""Some changes and costs are inevitable no matter how we leave the EU, but the more information the Government can provide on the process of Brexit, the more companies will be reassured they do not have to jump to relocate staff of operations."" He said that a year ago engagement with the Government had been ""negligible"" but this had since stepped up. However, businesses remained ""in the dark"" about any transitional arrangements and future trading relationships with the EU, Mr Martin added, and they could not wait until the end of Brexit talks in 2019 to find out. ""At present we're not seeing evidence of our members upping sticks and moving business elsewhere,"" he said. ""But from our recent survey we've seen 57% look at contingency planning."" Plans could involve employing people overseas rather than in the UK and deferring investment decisions, all of which could be ""incredibly damaging for the economy"". The Government said it was stepping up its dialogue with businesses to ensure their views were heard ""loud and clear"". A spokeswoman said: ""We are determined to deliver a successful outcome from our negotiations with the EU, one that works for businesses across the UK."" :: Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary David Davis returns to Brussels later to meet European Commission chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and conclude four days of talks on Britain's exit from the European Union."

He has now claimed to have killed a man and a woman years ago in Philadelphia, the state's largest city, 30 miles south of the family farm in Solebury, Bucks County, authorities have said. The city's police commissioner Richard Ross said detectives were looking through their files to check DiNardo's claims, but that his information was ""sketchy"" and officers were waiting to question him. ""We have to talk to him directly in order to have a starting point,"" he said. ""Dealing with it third-hand is virtually impossible."" Bucks County authorities are still investigating DiNardo's claims. Court papers released last week do not include details of the alleged Philadelphia killings. According to the papers, DiNardo told authorities he lured four men to his family's farm under the guise of marijuana transactions, before killing them. The bodies of three of the men were doused in gasoline and burned in an oil tank that had been converted into a cooker, which DiNardo is said to have called the ""pig roaster"". The 20-year-old then buried their remains. The fourth man was found on a remote part of the farm after DiNardo told police were to find him. Prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for DiNardo revealing where the victim was buried. The victims were Dean Finocchiaro, 19, Mark Sturgis, 22, Tom Meo, 21, and Jimi Taro Patrick, 19. DiNardo's 20-year-old cousin Sean Kratz is also charged in three of the killings and both are being held in jail without bail. They will appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing in September. Kratz's lawyer said her client and his family take the crimes very seriously and promised a ""vigorous and dedicated defence""."

Around 70,000 tonnes of cod is eaten in the UK each year - that is just over 1kg of cod per person. Consumers were warned about a decade ago that overfishing had caused the North Sea cod fishery's stocks to plunge from 270,000 tonnes in the 1970s to just 44,000 tonnes in 2006. After the fishery came close to collapse, a cod recovery plan was introduced, which reduced the number of days boats allowed to fish to reduce annual catches. Toby Middleton from the MSC said: ""Thanks to a collaborative, cross-industry effort, one of our most iconic fish has been brought back from the brink. ""Modified fishing gear, catch controls, well-managed fishing practices - all these steps have come together to revive a species that was in severe decline."" The cod stock has now recovered to 167,711 tonnes - the highest it has been since 1982.

Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker, who was the second-highest earner at more than £1.75m, joked ahead of the announcement over a potential backlash. He tweeted: ""Happy BBC salary day. I blame my agent and the other TV channels that pay more. Now where did I put my tin helmet?"" Happy BBC salary day. I blame my agent and the other TV channels that pay more. Now where did I put my tin helmet? The figures reveal a huge disparity between men and woman, with 17 men earning over £300,000, compared with seven women. Just two of the top 10 earners are women. The highest-earning female is Claudia Winkleman, the presenter of Strictly Come Dancing, who earns between £450,000 and £500,000. She is closely followed by The One Show's Alex Jones, earning over £400,000. :: BBC pay: Full list of highest earners :: Five takeaways from the BBC stars' pay reveal The third highest-paid woman is newsreader Fiona Bruce, who earns much less than male colleagues despite also fronting Antiques Roadshow. The list of salaries are broken down into bands, rather than specific figures, but Ms Bruce earns between £350,000 and £400,000. By contrast, Andrew Marr, Stephen Nolan from BBC Northern Ireland, Huw Edwards, John Humphrys, Nicky Campbell, Steve Wright, and Jeremy Vine are all paid considerably more. Vine, who presents Panorama and on Radio 2, took home between £700,000 and £750,000. Kirsty Wark, Sophie Raworth, Victoria Derbyshire, Mishal Husain and Martha Kearney all appear to earn less than male presenters doing similar jobs and with similar experience. Long-serving sports presenter Sue Barker earned £300,000 to £350,000, while former England striker Alan Shearer collected more than £400,000 for being a pundit. The highest-paid actor at the BBC is Derek Thompson, who plays Charlie in Casualty. He gets between £350,000 and £400,000 - more than Doctor Who's Peter Capaldi - who is in the £200,000 to £250,000 bracket (the same as EastEnders' actors Adam Woodyatt and Danny Dyer). While the BBC has published senior management pay for many years, this is the first time it has done so for on-air talent. BBC Director-General Tony Hall admitted the corporation needed to go ""further and faster on issues of gender and diversity"". He said: ""We need to employ the very best... talented people are critical for our relationship with audiences. ""We appreciate we are dealing with the public money. We do not take it lightly. The bill for top talent is down by 10% year on year. ""We are not afraid to walk away if money becomes an issue. ""Comparing people's pay is not straightforward.

""If it becomes clear that people doing the same job with the same level of experience but being paid at very different levels, people will question why that can be the case,"" said Mr Collins. Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron's former director of communications and ex-BBC News executive, said the corporation could be facing ""an inherent sexism issue"". He told Sky News: ""The people who decide those salaries will come up with all sorts of reasons for that, but when it's down in black and white that becomes a profound issue. ""People are going to say that's a problem and ask if there is an inherent sexism issue. ""I think it is right that people get to see the figures."" Meanwhile, a former employee of the BBC has been jailed for stealing over £155,000 from the corporation, creating false invoices for work expenses. Lee Richardson was sentenced to three years in prison on Tuesday after admitting to using public money on cars and family holidays.

Asked about the impact of housing on health outcomes, the Health Secretary told an audience at the King's Fund in London: ""Our whole approach is because we believe that improving the nation's health is holistic. ""It is about providing green spaces in cities to help improve our mental health, providing cycle routes, a whole range of things, and housing is critical. There are very strong links between poor health and poor-quality housing. ""I can see a world, not immediately but in perhaps five years' time, where the NHS pays to sort out the damp in someone's council house."" His suggestion drew a response from NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, appearing alongside him at the event, who asked in jest: ""From our increased budget?"" The NHS is under severe pressure, struggling to meet rising demand with funding increasing at its lowest level since the NHS was founded, and a growing recruitment crisis. The suggestion the NHS might take on additional costs may be met with scepticism by health service managers currently preparing for anticipated winter pressures, and grappling with local restructuring. Mr Hunt's comments came during a discussion of the next stages of NHS reforms known as Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs). They are intended to get regional NHS services, from hospitals to GPs and social care providers, to work more closely together to tackle rising demand. In some cases they have proposed closing or scaling back services, including A&E departments and maternity hospitals, in favour of larger more centralised facilities. The aim is to reduce hospital admissions and treat more patients at home or in the community, thus reducing pressure on emergency departments and improving outcomes. Mr Hunt and Mr Stevens believe STPs are the key to tackling pressure on the NHS without resorting to a fresh round of legislation and formal restructuring. Some critics say the proposals are a cover for cost-cutting, others that they are an attempt to work around previous failed reforms introduced by the Conservative-led coalition government. Mr Hunt announced that STPs would in future be rated, with the best-performing partnerships given freedom to try new healthcare models and faster access to funding. He also revealed 15 areas would receive a share of £325m in capital investment funds first announced in the Spring Budget. ""This funding will support strong local plans to help the NHS modernise and transform care for patients,"" he said. He also acknowledged that any proposed closures were better made by clinicians than politicians. ""People have far greater trust if clinicians and doctors make the case,"" he said. ""If politicians make the argument people think it is just about money."" Mr Stevens said: ""For patients it will mean easier GP appointments, modern A&Es, and better cancer and mental health care. ""For staff we are putting money where our mouth is in backing these practical plans developed by doctors, nurses and local leaders."""

As Tory councillors voted for Ms Campbell, Grenfell survivors in the public gallery jeered and shouted. Cries of ""shame on you"" and ""murderers"" could be heard, and the new leader was booed and heckled again as she addressed Kensington Town Hall. Asked if she had any plans to resign following the meeting, Ms Campbell said: ""No, not yet"". The Conservative councillor replaces former council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown, who resigned in the wake of the fire, in which at least 80 people died. During the stormy meeting, Ms Campbell invited Grenfell victims, survivors and community groups who wished to speak to contribute. She said: ""We meet at a time of unimaginable grief and sorrow. The Grenfell fire is the biggest civilian disaster in this country for a generation."" As Ms Campbell described how she had spent the past few weeks meeting survivors, the new council leader faced shouts of ""who?"" Ms Campbell admitted the council had ""let down"" the victims of the Grenfell tragedy, adding: ""I am deeply sorry for the grief and trauma you are suffering. ""I am deeply sorry we did not do more to help you when you needed it the most."" Residents used the meeting to express anger that some victims of the fire have not yet been buried or identified, as well as asking why survivors are still waiting to be rehoused. Some also described their experience of escaping the devastating blaze on 14 June. One survivor now shouting directly at new council leader Elizabeth Campbell accusing her directly of ""murder"".He says he wants Labour leader One shouted at Ms Campbell: ""You've let the dead down, now you want to come for the living? ""You are not in power, you will not be. The people must choose you and we have not chosen you... step down and resign."" Another resident said the treatment of the fire victims' families had been ""disgusting"", adding: ""We've been swept under the carpet."" One local, in tears and speaking via a translator, said: ""I beg you, do not play a game with us. I beg you, do not tell us lies. I beg you, do not waste our time."" Robert Atkinson, the leader of the Labour opposition, repeated his party's call for commissioners to take over the running of the Conservative-run authority. He told Ms Campbell she was ""part of the old regime"" and said there was ""nothing"" the Tory council group could do to restore the confidence of locals. His remarks were met with cheers from the public gallery. Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad, also a Labour councillor, branded the council ""not fit for purpose"" as she compared the election of a new leader to the rearranging of deckchairs on the Titanic. She said: ""The world is watching, do the right thing."" The meeting was conducted amid tight security both inside and outside the council chamber, with demonstrators who brandished Justice for Grenfell banners gathering around 45 minutes before the scheduled start. Proceedings began with a minute's silence for the victims of the fire, while councillors were warned the meeting would last as long as was necessary. At least one person was let in midway through after furious banging on the locked door separating the public gallery from the chamber floor. It was the first full council meeting since the Grenfell fire after a previous attempt was aborted last month by Mr Paget-Brown, who claimed proceedings could not take place in the presence of journalists who had gained entry. Thirty-seven of 169 offers of temporary accommodation had been accepted by Grenfell residents as of Wednesday morning - just over a fifth of the offers made."

Together with her husband Marcio and their two daughters she descended through the smoke-filled staircase of the tower. Mr Gomes told the Sunday Telegraph his wife gave birth to a stillborn child as she lay unconscious in the hours after they escaped from the tower. He said doctors said the baby's heartbeat had stopped beating and needed to be delivered so his wife would not contract an infection. Mr Gomes told the paper it was a ""very traumatic time"". The baby is thought to be the youngest victim of the disaster which claimed at least 80 lives. A funeral for the child, who the family had already decided to name Logan Issac, was attended by family and friends on Wednesday morning. The service was held at Saint Mary's Catholic Cemetery in Kensal Green, north-west London. Before the funeral a spokeswoman for the Diocese of Westminster revealed the theme of the homily delivered by Father Gerard Skinner during the Requiem Mass. ""He said he would talk about how, as parents, they expected to take care of Logan, but now he is in heaven taking care of them,"" she said. The hearse set off from a funeral directors near to the charred remains of the tower, arriving at the cemetery just before 10am. The vehicles were covered with flowers, including two teddy bears made out of chrysanthemums and the name Logan spelled out in white chrysanthemums and roses on one side. The diocese's spokeswoman said she believed the chapel was full for the service."

2017-07-19,"When Vince Cable appeared on TV's Strictly Come Dancing in 2010, he danced the foxtrot.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170720032142/http://news.sky.com/story/vince-cable-lib-dem-leader-economic-guru-and-romantic-novelist-10954630,"Now he's waltzed into the leadership of the Liberal Democrats unopposed, but with a band of just 12 MPs. At 74, he's his party's oldest ever leader. He's six years older then Jeremy Corbyn and three years older than Donald Trump. In fact, he's the oldest leader of a UK political party since Sir Winston Churchill, who was 80 when he stepped down as Conservative leader. Sir Vince started his political career in the Labour Party, as a councillor in Glasgow and then parliamentary candidate in York in 1970. He joined the breakaway SDP in the early 1980s and eventually became a Lib Dem when the party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988. In the 1970s, he was a special adviser in Whitehall to John Smith, who later became Labour leader. And before becoming MP for Twickenham in 1997, he was chief economist for Shell. As a keen ballroom dancer, it's perhaps not surprising he's a romantic at heart. Since his first wife died and he remarried, he has worn both his wedding rings. He'll certainly need all his charm to woo voters in the months and years ahead. His leadership will no doubt be defined by his party's ability to influence the Brexit process. He faces daunting challenges. For a start, now the Lib Dems are no longer the third biggest party in the Commons, their leader is rarely called during Prime Minister's Questions. Secondly, according to party grandees, he needs to concentrate on big issues, like Brexit and the economy, and not get drawn into rows over issues like gay sex, as his predecessor Tim Farron did. ""His tremendous advantage is his experience, so his age isn't a drawback,"" said a grandee who worked with Lib Dem leaders Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy, Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg. On Brexit, Sir Vince has expressed the controversial view in recent weeks that it may not go ahead. And he wants a second referendum. ""I'm beginning to think that Brexit may never happen,"" he said earlier this month. ""The problems are so enormous, the divisions within the two main parties are so enormous I can see a scenario in which this doesn't happen."" On the economy, his supporters claim he predicted the 2008 financial crash coming. Now he thinks income tax should rise to pay for health and social care. He has represented his party at PMQs before, with spectacular success, notably in November 2007 when Gordon Brown was in trouble over party donations, the Northern Rock crisis and other problems. ""The House has noticed the Prime Minister's remarkable transformation in the past few weeks from Stalin to Mr Bean, creating chaos out of order, rather than order out of chaos,"" he said, prompting howls of laughter from MPs on all sides. Sir Vince's supporters in his party claim his five years as business secretary in David Cameron's coalition government make him the Lib Dems' best qualified leader of modern times. They point out that his reputation as a wise economic guru and sage means he is constantly in demand for TV and radio interviews, which will greatly raise the profile of his party now he is leader. But his critics claim there are serious blemishes in his record in the coalition government too, the most obvious being the Lib Dems' tuition fees betrayal when he was the Secretary of State responsible for the U-turn. He also blundered when he told undercover reporters he had ""declared war on Rupert Murdoch"" in his BskyB takeover bid, forcing David Cameron to strip him of his responsibility for the bid and all media issues. As Lib Dem leader, however, it is Brexit that Sir Vince is now about to declare war on. And with his profile already much higher than Tim Farron's, Remainers will see his election as a boost for their fight. But how long will Sir Vince stay on taking the lead in his party? His political dance partner, new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, is half his age at 37 and it's thought he'll take a bow and let her step up before the next election. Away from politics, his romantic instincts aren't just confined to ballroom dancing. Less well known than his appearance on ""Strictly"" is the fact that he has become a romantic novelist. Yes, really. After writing several books about the economy, his first novel Open Arms, said to be a political thriller and love story set in a post-Brexit future, is due to be published in September. Asked in a recent interview if it's about ""sex and political intrigue"", he said: ""It is not actually about sex. The sex is very discreet, it is not going to win the bad sex award."" So if you thought the 74-year-old new Lib Dem leader was just a stuffy old economist obsessed with Brexit, you'd be wrong. It seems he's also a racy romantic. As they might say on ""Strictly"": Cha, Cha, Cha!"

The microbial parasite cryptosporidium left customers without safe drinking water causing supermarkets to put a restriction on the amount of bottled water bought per customer after a surge of panic buyers. The water firm is being prosecuted by the Drinking Water Inspectorate after routine tests last year found cryptosporidium, which can cause diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting. Lisa Roberts QC entered the guilty plea on behalf of United Utilities to the charge of supplying water unfit for human consumption between 30 July 2015 and 18 August 2015. District Judge Jane Goodwin agreed to formally withdraw charges of failing to disinfect water that was supplied for domestic purposes and failing to design and continuously operate an adequate treatment process before supplying water for domestic purposes. Richard Banwell, counsel for the Drinking Water Inspectorate, asked for the case to be sent to Crown court saying it was likely there would be ""a substantial fine in this case"". A United Utilities spokesman said: ""We have taken a full and open role with the DWI during its investigation and complied with all its requests for information. ""A full programme of remedial and repair work has already been implemented to safeguard future supplies."" Sentencing will take place on 21 August at Preston Crown Court."
2017-07-19,"Falling incomes for top earners and rising employment have helped narrow inequality, though some UK regions are being left behind, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170720032142/http://news.sky.com/story/fall-in-income-inequality-since-recession-ifs-report-10953540,"The independent research institute's annual report on living standards, poverty and inequality - which is based largely on official figures covering 2015/16 - said the Midlands had suffered particularly in geographical terms. Average incomes in the East and West Midlands were 6% and 9% below the national average respectively, the report said. It also identified northern England and Wales as two further regions where average earnings were no higher than incomes in the South East in the late 1990s. The study said London remained the most unequal part of the UK but there had been a ""particularly large fall in income inequality"" because low-income households had seen their earnings jump more than 10% since the late 2000s. It charted a move in the other direction for the top 10% of earners and also pointed to employment growth. The report was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, whose chief executive Campbell Robb said: ""These alarming figures highlight how far behind some parts of the UK have fallen, with millions of people seeing their incomes stagnate or even worse, decline. ""Rebalancing our lopsided economy must be a priority if we are to create a country that works for all. ""Average incomes in the Midlands, Wales and the north of England have fallen further behind the rest of the country. ""Low earnings are an increasingly important driver of poverty, with the proportion of children in poverty in working households rising sharply in recent years. ""The Government must make urgent progress with its industrial strategy, working across party times to deliver a plan that drives up skills and productivity across the country. ""That will deliver more and better jobs and higher living standards that people desperately need."" The report's findings cover a period before the return of the household income squeeze this year - with inflation outpacing wage growth again for the first time since 2014 in the wake of the Brexit vote. A Treasury spokesman said: 'We are building an economy that works for everyone by sharing prosperity and opportunity throughout the UK so nobody is held back because of where they come from. ""We have recently agreed seven devolution deals worth £4.8bn, giving local leaders extra money and powers to create jobs, boost skills, build homes and improve local transport. ""Our National Living Wage is also helping to deliver the fastest pay rise in 20 years for the lowest paid across our country."""

According to the annual report for the Department for Exiting the European Union, £78,000 was also spent on a separate case relating to the European Economic Area, which was blocked by the High Court. However, overall, the new department spent less than half of its £50m budget for 2016/17. Staffing was the biggest expense at £14m, with legal costs totalling £3.7m. At the time of its creation in July 2016, the Brexit Department had just 56 staff, but this had increased to 384 by March and is expected to grow further over the next year. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""The Conservatives fought every step of the way in the courts to try and avoid proper scrutiny over Brexit. Now the public is having to pick up the tab. ""None of this would have happened if the Government had done the right thing and given Parliament a full role from the start. ""But this bill is nothing compared to the huge cost the country will pay if the Conservatives plough ahead with their extreme version of Brexit."" In his foreword to the report, Mr Davis said his department is now ""in a strong position to deliver a smooth and orderly exit"" from the EU. He added: ""I know that with the continued energy and creativity shown by the department so far, we will deliver a deal that works for everyone."""

The sequence of verbatim accounts leaked by fellow Cabinet ministers has little precedent, like much in politics these days. The PM, though, will be obliged to tell her own Cabinet to pipe down and concentrate on serving the country. :: May to bickering Tories: It's me or Corbyn Some MPs feel a stronger prime minister would have fired the likely suspects, particularly as the Cabinet Secretary circulated in December an irate memo demanding that leakers, including ministers, be fired, even when the leaks did not include issues of national security. That memo was itself leaked. In truth, the attempt to undermine the Chancellor has somewhat backfired. He is unsackable because of this, and the noises off, are more of a sign of an argument going his way rather than the way of the leakers. The Chancellor has backed leaving the single market and the customs union, but has stressed the protection of jobs in a transition period. He is backed across industry and finance by businesspeople for whom the sunny rhetoric of pro-Brexit Cabinet minister no longer cuts the mustard (if it ever did). These decision makers will have to make investment decisions at board meetings for their 2018/19 financial year in the coming weeks and months. That period includes the March 2019 likely date of Brexit, and therefore against a backdrop of this squabbling and of Cabinet ministers telling the EU to ""go whistle"" - they have to make judgements about the likelihood of a no deal Brexit. This domestic political chaos is of course noticed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. Where the PM had hoped for a cast iron strengthened hand in Brexit negotiations, she now struggles to maintain the unity of even her two dozen Cabinet ministers. The Government is consciously avoiding votes in the Commons and is attempting to limit the opportunity for votes to be brought by the Opposition and by backbench MPs too. It has also allowed Justine Greening to take from her capital budget to fund real terms protection for per capita schools spending in England. The recess cannot come quickly enough for the Government or the Prime Minister. Regroup and rest is the message. The danger is that the logic of leadership challenges will fester among a disgruntled Cabinet as they escape a torrid few months of politics. A period of political silence might well benefit the Government, but it cannot last, particularly as Brexit negotiations continue next month."

""In this summer of warm prosecco I think we in the Cabinet would also do well to reflect on those military virtues: loyalty, discipline, cohesion, that might better enable us first to concentrate our fire on a dangerous enemy in reach of Downing Street - somebody who would lower our defences, scrap our deterrent, weaken our response to terrorism. ""And second, to better articulate again the moral case for lower taxation, for honest public financing, for wider opportunity, enterprise and ownership - the Conservative case."" Theresa May will face the Labour leader later in a final Commons summer showdown. It comes just a day after the Prime Minister warned her top team that Tory infighting could pave the way for Mr Corbyn to seize power. Mrs May was forced to tell senior ministers on Tuesday to show ""unity"" as she urged them to keep details of their discussions around the Cabinet table private after a series of briefings against Chancellor Philip Hammond. Splits at the top of the Government have made headlines in recent days, with disclosures of remarks designed to damage Mr Hammond - including claims he said public sector workers were ""overpaid"" and ""even a woman can drive a train"". Mr Hammond responded by appearing to accuse colleagues of briefing against him due to their unhappiness with his position on leaving the EU."

Examples of disparities between stars include the £200,000 gap between Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce, who both present evening news programmes. BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker is included on the list of high earners, while his co-presenter Louise Minchin is absent. On Twitter, Walker explained that he and Minchin earn ""exactly the same"" for presenting the morning news show - but he is paid extra for working on Football Focus.

A Labour source described the pay gap as ""obviously wrong"", with Jeremy Corbyn suggesting BBC stars could expect dramatic pay drops if he enters government. His party has proposed a maximum twenty-to-one ratio between the highest and lowest paid staff in public sector organisations, which would cap pay at £320,000. :: Seven surprises from BBC pay reveal BBC director-general Tony Hall has admitted that the list shows ""the need to go further and faster on issues of gender and diversity"" - however, he defended the six and seven-figure salaries being funded by licence fee payers. Many presenters continued to front their shows as normal today, with one listener confronting Radio 2 host Jeremy Vine and asking whether he was ""embarrassed"" to accept his pay cheque of between £700,000 and £750,000 a year. In another bizarre exchange, BBC head of radio James Purnell was asked how he could justify Vine's salary - by Vine himself. Andrew Marr was one of the first stars to defend their pay packet, with the £400,000-a-year politics presenter claiming his salary had fallen by £139,000 over the past two years. Radio 2 DJ and former Top Gear presenter Chris Evans was revealed as the highest earner, with £2.2m last year, while Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker was the second-highest at more than £1.75m."

2017-07-20,"Sky, the owner of Sky News, today reacted with disappointment following a further delay to its proposed takeover by the US media giant 21st Century Fox.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170721035802/http://news.sky.com/story/government-says-decision-on-fox-takeover-of-sky-within-weeks-10954968,"Karen Bradley, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said she was not yet in a position to make a final decision on whether to send the deal for a full investigation by the British competition authorities. Ms Bradley has already said she is ""minded to"" refer Fox's bid for Sky to the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) for a so-called 'Phase 2' investigation on the grounds of media plurality. She confirmed today that this was still the case. However, she told MPs, she was still wading through various representations made to her about the proposed takeover. Ms Bradley added: ""There has not been time to consider all the representations and I am not in a position today to make my final decision on referral."" The CMA is likely to require up to six months to carry out a full investigation from the moment the proposed takeover is referred to it - so both Fox and Sky are keen for that referral to happen as quickly as possible. Sky reacted to her statement with disappointment. It said: ""Businesses require a level of certainty in order to plan and invest. ""As such, we are disappointed by this further delay. Almost eight months have now elapsed since the announcement of the offer, with decisions to clear the transaction received from all other relevant regulatory authorities, including the European Commission and the relevant authorities in all four of the other main jurisdictions in which we operate. ""In the UK, a thorough process has been concluded by the industry regulator Ofcom, which the Secretary of State has publicly acknowledged was ""unequivocal"" in its advice that there are no broadcasting standards concerns justifying a reference to the CMA. ""A decision by the Secretary of State on the next step in the process, whatever that may be, now needs to be made as swiftly as possible."" Fox, the world's fourth-largest media company after Comcast, Disney and Time Warner and the maker of hit TV shows like The Simpsons and Modern Family, already owns 39.1% of Sky. Shortly before Christmas, it tabled a proposal to buy the remaining shares it does not already own for £11.7bn, valuing the whole of Sky at £18.5bn. Ms Bradley subsequently referred the deal to telecoms and broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, and to the Competition & Markets Authority, asking the latter to carry out a so-called 'Phase 1' investigation. Ofcom was asked to look at two issues - firstly that the deal would damage plurality of media ownership in the UK and secondly that Fox was committed to maintaining UK broadcasting standards. It was also asked by Ms Bradley separately to assess whether Fox and its directors were 'fit and proper', in the jargon, to hold a UK broadcasting licence. The regulator, following a three-month investigation, subsequently said that there was no reason to block the deal based on Fox's commitment to UK broadcasting standards. It also ruled that Fox and its directors were 'fit and proper' to hold a UK broadcasting licence. Ofcom did, however, warn that the takeover could affect plurality of ownership. In response, Fox guaranteed to continue investing in Sky News for the next five years on at least the same terms as present, while also promising to continue broadcasting under the Sky News brand for that time. It also pledged to create an independent editorial board for Sky News that would, for example, have control over appointing the head of Sky News. The regulator said these commitments were enough to mitigate its concerns on the plurality issue but Ms Bradley said Fox needed to go further and that, without extra undertakings, she was minded to refer the takeover to the CMA for a so-called 'Phase 2' investigation. Ms Bradley revealed on Thursday that Fox has not made any new commitments or undertakings since Ofcom published its original verdict and said that therefore she was still minded to refer the deal to the CMA. Since publishing Ofcom's analysis, Ms Bradley has been lobbied by a number of opponents of the deal, led by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, and Sir Vince Cable, the former business secretary. They have asked her to block the takeover and argued that Ofcom's guidance was wrong. Earlier this week, 21st Century Fox responded, urging Ms Bradley not to delay the 'Phase 2' investigation. In a strongly worded letter, the company's legal advisers, Allen & Overy, said that agreeing to the MPs' demands would ""constitute the most blatant form of political interference"". Fox has also pointed out that, as its proposed takeover of Sky represents a significant investment into the UK, other overseas investors will be watching the Government's response closely before making their own decisions about investing in post-Brexit Britain. It responded to the latest update from Ms Bradley by saying: ""In light of the transaction's benefits to the UK creative economy, we would urge the Secretary of State to complete the regulatory process expeditiously."" She reminded the Commons that, under the 2002 Enterprise Act, she is obliged to make a decision without ""undue delay"" and said it was possible that she would refer the deal to the CMA while Parliament was in recess. She said that, if this happened, she would write to all the parties involved and to the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, as well as the Labour Party. News Corporation, the media giant led by Rupert Murdoch, first sought to buy full control of Sky - then called BSkyB - in June 2010 for £8bn. The deal attracted scrutiny since it would have brought Sky News into the same company as News Corp's UK media asset - The Sun, The News of the World, The Times and The Sunday Times. It was opposed by other newspaper publishers and, in response to regulatory concerns, BSkyB agreed to hive off Sky News as a separate company in the event of a takeover. However, following revelations the following summer that the News of the World had hacked the mobile phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the takeover bid was abandoned. Since then, News Corp has demerged its film and television assets outside Australia into a new company, 21st Century Fox, leaving it as a focused publishing business. Apart from its UK newspaper titles, News Corp also owns the Wall Street Journal, The Australian, the New York Post and the book publisher Harper Collins, as well as UK radio stations including Talk Sport. 21st Century Fox, meanwhile, has no other UK assets other than its existing shareholding in Sky. Critics, though, have argued that because Mr Murdoch and his family own shareholdings in both 21st Century Fox and News Corp, plurality of media ownership would be reduced by a takeover of Sky. In response, Fox has argued that the media landscape has changed since the previous bid, with newspaper circulation falling by almost two-fifths since 2010. It has also pointed out that the rise of internet news suppliers such as Buzzfeed, along with digital and social media companies such as Google and Facebook, has changed the way people consume news. It suggests this means the combined share of the UK news market enjoyed by News Corp and Fox has fallen. Critics of the deal have argued that, thanks to the rising popularity of The Sun's website, the combined share of the two companies may have increased. The Sun's online reach is now reckoned to lag only that of the BBC's website and the Mail Online. Ofcom's own figures show that, of the 20 most-consumed sources of news in the UK, only three - Sky News, the Sky News website and The Sun - are owned by News Corp and Fox. The BBC alone accounts for seven. The European Commission has already given the green light to the deal, as have individual regulators in the other countries in which Sky broadcasts. Sky has more than 22 million customers in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy. Shares of Sky, which are valued at 1075p under the proposed takeover, were up 4p at 969.5p at 1205."
2017-07-20,"The pound has tumbled to an eight-month low against the euro, spelling higher costs for British holidaymakers getting ready for summer breaks.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170721035802/http://news.sky.com/story/pound-tumbles-to-eight-month-low-against-the-euro-10955383,"Sterling slipped close to €1.11 as the euro strengthened in reaction to remarks by European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi while the UK currency was again buffeted by fears over Brexit. The pound's dip - of as much as two cents - took it to its lowest level since November 2016. It will weaken the spending power of British families preparing to flock to Spanish beaches and French campsites when school holidays begin later this week. Sterling was also lower against the US dollar - at a time when Washington is undergoing its own political turbulence - dipping below $1.30 after spending several days above that level. But it was the strong performance of the euro that was mainly making waves on currency markets. It shot higher against the dollar as well as the pound despite the ECB marking no change to interest rates or wider monetary policy guidance at its latest meeting. Traders seized on comments by Mr Draghi that policy makers would discuss changes to its €2tn stimulus programme in the autumn. The euro has been strengthening recently as signs of an economic recovery on the single currency bloc increase speculation about tightening policy. Ultra-low interest rates and a huge programme of bond-purchasing, or quantitative easing - effectively pumping money into the economy - were put in place when the economy was in a much more fragile state. An upturn and return to normality should put an end to the need for this support - and the withdrawal of the stimulus will make the currency a more attractive bet. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said Mr Draghi's comments were his way of endorsing the recent upward trend for the euro - without announcing anything new. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct, said: ""No news means no change in the euro's trend, which for now is higher."" Meanwhile on Thursday, the pound was under pressure as ""fundamental"" differences over EU citizens' rights and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice emerged following Brexit talks. Elsewhere, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said a bespoke trade deal between Britain and the European Union should be ""one of the easiest in human history"" to reach but that Britain could ""survive"" without an agreement. Earlier, the pound had been buoyed by better than expected official figures on retail sales for June, before the gains faded."
2017-07-20,"At the start of the last Cabinet meeting before recess, the Prime Minister will tell the leakers to respect the confidence of the Cabinet room.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170721035802/http://news.sky.com/story/the-danger-that-lies-ahead-for-theresa-may-10952367,"The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been the subject of a concerted series of indiscretions, designed, in his eyes, to rein in his push for a soft landing transition to the process of leaving the European Union. The sequence of verbatim accounts leaked by fellow Cabinet ministers has little precedent, like much in politics these days. The PM, though, will be obliged to tell her own Cabinet to pipe down and concentrate on serving the country. :: May to bickering Tories: It's me or Corbyn Some MPs feel a stronger prime minister would have fired the likely suspects, particularly as the Cabinet Secretary circulated in December an irate memo demanding that leakers, including ministers, be fired, even when the leaks did not include issues of national security. That memo was itself leaked. In truth, the attempt to undermine the Chancellor has somewhat backfired. He is unsackable because of this, and the noises off, are more of a sign of an argument going his way rather than the way of the leakers. The Chancellor has backed leaving the single market and the customs union, but has stressed the protection of jobs in a transition period. He is backed across industry and finance by businesspeople for whom the sunny rhetoric of pro-Brexit Cabinet minister no longer cuts the mustard (if it ever did). These decision makers will have to make investment decisions at board meetings for their 2018/19 financial year in the coming weeks and months. That period includes the March 2019 likely date of Brexit, and therefore against a backdrop of this squabbling and of Cabinet ministers telling the EU to ""go whistle"" - they have to make judgements about the likelihood of a no deal Brexit. This domestic political chaos is of course noticed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. Where the PM had hoped for a cast iron strengthened hand in Brexit negotiations, she now struggles to maintain the unity of even her two dozen Cabinet ministers. The Government is consciously avoiding votes in the Commons and is attempting to limit the opportunity for votes to be brought by the Opposition and by backbench MPs too. It has also allowed Justine Greening to take from her capital budget to fund real terms protection for per capita schools spending in England. The recess cannot come quickly enough for the Government or the Prime Minister. Regroup and rest is the message. The danger is that the logic of leadership challenges will fester among a disgruntled Cabinet as they escape a torrid few months of politics. A period of political silence might well benefit the Government, but it cannot last, particularly as Brexit negotiations continue next month."
2017-07-20,"When Vince Cable appeared on TV's Strictly Come Dancing in 2010, he danced the foxtrot.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170721035802/http://news.sky.com/story/vince-cable-lib-dem-leader-economic-guru-and-romantic-novelist-10954630,"Now he's waltzed into the leadership of the Liberal Democrats unopposed, but with a band of just 12 MPs. At 74, he's his party's oldest ever leader. He's six years older then Jeremy Corbyn and three years older than Donald Trump. In fact, he's the oldest leader of a UK political party since Sir Winston Churchill, who was 80 when he stepped down as Conservative leader. Sir Vince started his political career in the Labour Party, as a councillor in Glasgow and then parliamentary candidate in York in 1970. He joined the breakaway SDP in the early 1980s and eventually became a Lib Dem when the party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988. In the 1970s, he was a special adviser in Whitehall to John Smith, who later became Labour leader. And before becoming MP for Twickenham in 1997, he was chief economist for Shell. As a keen ballroom dancer, it's perhaps not surprising he's a romantic at heart. Since his first wife died and he remarried, he has worn both his wedding rings. He'll certainly need all his charm to woo voters in the months and years ahead. His leadership will no doubt be defined by his party's ability to influence the Brexit process. He faces daunting challenges. For a start, now the Lib Dems are no longer the third biggest party in the Commons, their leader is rarely called during Prime Minister's Questions. Secondly, according to party grandees, he needs to concentrate on big issues, like Brexit and the economy, and not get drawn into rows over issues like gay sex, as his predecessor Tim Farron did. ""His tremendous advantage is his experience, so his age isn't a drawback,"" said a grandee who worked with Lib Dem leaders Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy, Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg. On Brexit, Sir Vince has expressed the controversial view in recent weeks that it may not go ahead. And he wants a second referendum. ""I'm beginning to think that Brexit may never happen,"" he said earlier this month. ""The problems are so enormous, the divisions within the two main parties are so enormous I can see a scenario in which this doesn't happen."" On the economy, his supporters claim he predicted the 2008 financial crash coming. Now he thinks income tax should rise to pay for health and social care. He has represented his party at PMQs before, with spectacular success, notably in November 2007 when Gordon Brown was in trouble over party donations, the Northern Rock crisis and other problems. ""The House has noticed the Prime Minister's remarkable transformation in the past few weeks from Stalin to Mr Bean, creating chaos out of order, rather than order out of chaos,"" he said, prompting howls of laughter from MPs on all sides. Sir Vince's supporters in his party claim his five years as business secretary in David Cameron's coalition government make him the Lib Dems' best qualified leader of modern times. They point out that his reputation as a wise economic guru and sage means he is constantly in demand for TV and radio interviews, which will greatly raise the profile of his party now he is leader. But his critics claim there are serious blemishes in his record in the coalition government too, the most obvious being the Lib Dems' tuition fees betrayal when he was the Secretary of State responsible for the U-turn. He also blundered when he told undercover reporters he had ""declared war on Rupert Murdoch"" in his BskyB takeover bid, forcing David Cameron to strip him of his responsibility for the bid and all media issues. As Lib Dem leader, however, it is Brexit that Sir Vince is now about to declare war on. And with his profile already much higher than Tim Farron's, Remainers will see his election as a boost for their fight. But how long will Sir Vince stay on taking the lead in his party? His political dance partner, new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, is half his age at 37 and it's thought he'll take a bow and let her step up before the next election. Away from politics, his romantic instincts aren't just confined to ballroom dancing. Less well known than his appearance on ""Strictly"" is the fact that he has become a romantic novelist. Yes, really. After writing several books about the economy, his first novel Open Arms, said to be a political thriller and love story set in a post-Brexit future, is due to be published in September. Asked in a recent interview if it's about ""sex and political intrigue"", he said: ""It is not actually about sex. The sex is very discreet, it is not going to win the bad sex award."" So if you thought the 74-year-old new Lib Dem leader was just a stuffy old economist obsessed with Brexit, you'd be wrong. It seems he's also a racy romantic. As they might say on ""Strictly"": Cha, Cha, Cha!"

But when the 40-year-old, who was dressed in pyjamas, approached the driver's door of a police vehicle she was shot dead by officer Mohamed Noor, who was in the passenger seat of the squad car. A transcript of the first 911 call reveals Ms Damond told an operator: ""I can hear someone out the back and I'm not sure if she's having sex or being raped"". After giving her address, she added: ""I think she just yelled out 'help' but it's difficult, the sound has been going on for a while. ""I don't think she's enjoying it. I think it's, I don't know."" Asked to detail what she could hear, Ms Damond said: ""It sounds like sex noises, but it's been going on for a while and I think she tried to say 'help' and it sounds distressed."" Eight minutes later, the meditation teacher from Sydney called 911 again to check where the responding officers were. After they arrived, the 40-year-old was shot by one of the two officers and died from a wound to the abdomen. At the time, the officers' body cameras were not switched on and footage from the car failed to capture the incident. Mr Noor has refused to be interviewed by investigators, but driver Matthew Harrity said he had been ""startled by a loud sound"" as Ms Damond approached the car. His lawyer, Fred Bruno, has said it is ""certainly reasonable"" to assume the officers were concerned about an ambush. Mr Bruno told the Star Tribune that recent cases of police deaths in the US - such as the murder of a New York City officer as she sat in her patrol car - may have made the pair feel unsafe. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has described the shooting as ""inexplicable"" and demanded answers on what ""went tragically wrong"". He said: ""How can a woman out in the street in her pyjamas seeking assistance be shot like that?"" On Wednesday, hundreds of Ms Damond's family members and friends gathered for a vigil on Sydney's Freshwater beach, where they stood in silence before casting pink flowers into the water."

Following the Second World War, historians published the exchanges as part of an academic programme. However, files released by the National Archives reveal Churchill tried to keep the documents secret as he feared it would damage the reputation of the Duke, who had visited Hitler following his abdication as King Edward VIII in 1936. According to the captured telegrams, Ribbentrop told the German ambassador in Madrid that the Nazis were ""determined to compel England to make peace by the use of all methods"". Part of the plan was to convince the Duke and Duchess of Windsor that Churchill would order their assassination by British intelligence if they left Europe. Meanwhile, other telegrams recorded a series of conversations between Ribbentrop and German agents, one of whom claimed the Duke was ""toying"" with the idea of publicly disassociating himself from ""the present tendency of British policy"". The agent added: ""Duke and Duchess do not fear the King, who is altogether stupid, as much as the clever Queen, who is said to be constantly against Duke and in particular against duchess."" Another agent said the Royal couple appeared interested when it was suggested the Nazis could reinstall the Duke on the throne, noting ""the duchess in particular became very thoughtful"". The lurid content of the telegrams moved Churchill to write to US President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953, appealing to his sense of ""justice and chivalry"" to delay their publication for 10 or 20 years. Churchill wrote: ""If they were to be included in an official publication they might leave the impression that the Duke was in close touch with German agents and was listening to suggestions that were disloyal."" Despite the fears of the former PM, the telegrams were published four years later after the historians in charge of the release programme threatened to resign."

That was despite strong sales growth in the period. The retailer had previously accused the media of an ""extreme campaign"" against it, turning shoppers away amid outrage over controversial working practices at its warehouse. Chairman Keith Hellawell, who made that remark, insisted in the firm's results statement that the changes it had made in-house meant Sports Direct was a company of which ""Britain can rightly feel very proud"". Total sales grew by almost 12% to £3.2bn while UK sports retail revenue increased by 6.3%. The company's updated growth forecasts, predicting profit growth of up to 15% in the current year, helped shares soar. They closed 11% higher. In his update to investors Mr Ashley, the company's majority shareholder who took over as chief executive in the period, said he had acted to limit the impact of the pound's heavy falls against the US dollar. That followed an initial failure by the company to have a hedging strategy in place ahead of the Brexit vote. However, he warned Sports Direct remained ""exposed"" to longer-term sterling weakness. Sports Direct reported a currency loss of almost £24m for the year. The hit is mainly a consequence of using dollars to buy its branded goods. It has been a torrid year for the company's board, while a £14m High Court damages action Mr Ashley is currently fighting has raised allegations of questionable business practices and revealed how the billionaire boss - in his own words - likes to get drunk. Sports Direct, under pressure from investors in the FTSE 250 firm and politicians, agreed a series of changes to its operations as it became mired in allegations of Victorian working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse and poor corporate governance. The saga culminated in Mr Ashley twice saving Mr Hellawell from the axe through his voting rights. It even had to fight off claims by MPs visiting Shirebrook that Sports Direct had tried to bug the politicians' conversations. Mr Ashley said its investment, including £300m in its stores, meant Sports Direct was now on course to become the ""Selfridges"" of sport, with profits expected to be up to 15% higher in the current financial year. ""However, we will continue to be conservative in managing for the medium to long-term, which may result in short-term fluctuations in underlying (earnings), particularly given the continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit,"" he added."

One of America's worst criminals, Gacy was convicted of killing 33 young men before being executed in 1994. Eight of his victims were buried without being identified. A builder from a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, Gacy also worked as an amateur clown and lured young men to his home by pretending to be a police officer or by promising them work. He stabbed one of his victims and strangled the others before burying most in his basement and dumping others in a river. The killings took place between 1972 and 1978, the year Gacy was arrested. Police dug up the eight unidentified victims in 2011, having asked the relatives of young men who had disappeared between 1970 and 1978 to submit saliva samples. Two of Haakenson's siblings submitted samples, with Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart revealing on Wednesday there was a ""strong genetic association"" between the samples and remains that have now been identified as the missing teenager. Haakenson's sister Lorie Sisterman told a local CBS radio station: ""It's not every day you hear this: A monster murdered your brother. ""It's just not an everyday, normal conversation that you have with a detective from a different state that tells you this awful news."" Haakenson's body was one of three found buried on top of each other, with all three believed to have been killed within a short space of time in early August 1976. Haakenson, from Minnesota, left home in 1976 when he was aged 16 and was last heard from on 5 August of that year when he called his mother and told her he was in Chicago. He is the second of the unknown victims to have been identified, with 19-year-old William George Bundy identified just months after the eight bodies were exhumed. Haakenson's mother attempted to discover if he was one of Gacy's victims by travelling to Chicago in 1979, but died without knowing her son's fate. The call for DNA samples also led to four unrelated cold cases being solved, locating five missing people who were still alive and two who had died elsewhere in the US."

It comes as a Home Office report reveals there were 123,142 officers across all ranks in England and Wales at the end of March this year - the lowest amount since 1985. Rachel Almeida, Victim Support's head of policy, said the rising crime figures were ""a great cause for concern"". Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on the Government to increase police officer numbers and ""address what people are concerned about"". :: Pressure on police forces sees officers contemplating suicide, says senior detective Office for National Statistics data shows the increase in crime was partly driven by a spike in violence against the person, which soared 18% to 175,060 offences. A long-term decline in the rate of theft was reversed, rising 7% to 118,774, while public order offences jumped 39% to 78,697. Sexual offences were up 14%, public order offences by 39%, while knife and gun crime rose by more than 20%. While the ONS statistics showed a 10% annual rise, the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime, showed a 7% drop. The ONS said the Crime Survey of England and Wales ""doesn't cover all crime and it doesn't cover all victims"", but Number 10 claimed it was the ""more reliable"" measure. Policing minister Nick Hurd told Sky News the ONS figures showed ""real growth in worrying crimes, particularly around violent crimes with knives and guns"". He claimed crime is ""falling but changing"", adding there were ""worrying trends we are absolutely determined to stay on top of"". Asked about the falling numbers of police officers, Mr Hurd said the Government will ""engage very closely with the police, force by force, to really drill down on the pressures they are under"". Earlier this week, it emerged retired Met Police officers had been asked to consider returning to work as force faces ""unprecedented demand"" on its detective capability.

Judge David Stockdale QC told the defendant during sentencing that it was ""difficult to conceive of a deceit so degrading or so damaging for the victim upon its discovery"". The 27-year-old slumped to the floor of the dock as the sentence was handed down. Newland, from Willaston, Cheshire, was originally jailed for eight years in November 2015. But the initial conviction was quashed after it was decided the trial judge's summing up had not been fair and balanced. On Thursday, Judge Stockdale told Newland: ""This was a deceit of such subtlety and cunning in its planning and was a deceit, from your point of view, so successful in its execution that an outsider unaware of the full history of the case might find it difficult to comprehend. ""But truth can sometimes be stranger than fiction. The truth, the whole truth here is as surprising as it is profoundly disturbing."" Newland had created a fictional Facebook profile, pretending to be a half-Filipino, half-Latino man called Kye Fortune. During ""hundreds"" of hours on the phone with her victim, also in her twenties, ""Kye"" told her that ""he"" was having treatment for cancer and paranoid about his physical appearance. The victim subsequently agreed to wear a blindfold during their meetings - not only during up to 15 sexual encounters, but also while watching TV, during a car journey and while sunbathing. Newland had claimed both women were gay and denied concealing her true identity. In an extract from a victim impact statement, the complainant said Newland had ""managed to plague every attempt I have made to make my life positive"". She was left with ""this continuous, ominous, unsettling feeling she has planted in what is left of my life"". Newland's barrister, Nigel Power QC, said his client had significant and long-standing mental health problems. It had been documented from an early age that she had social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, an eating disorder and dyspraxia. Mr Power said that since her first conviction, Newland had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and gender identity disorder. ""The defendant now has good insight into those conditions and is obtaining such treatment as she can to help to come to terms with them,"" he said. But while the judge accepted the psychiatric evidence that the risk of offending was ""very low"", he also noted that Newland had shown no remorse and maintained her innocence. Nor did her mental health problems ""excuse"" her actions, the judge said."
2017-07-20,Sunny weather is being credited for a better-than-expected leap in retail sales last month that boosted economic growth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170721035802/http://news.sky.com/story/sun-shines-for-retailers-as-sales-jump-06-in-june-10954862,"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a 0.6% increase in sales volumes in June after a dip of more than 1% in May. It meant, the number crunchers said, that sales had grown by 1.5% over the second quarter of the year as a whole. The ONS calculated it would add almost 0.1% to overall output in the economy, which is tipped to have expanded at a better pace than the 0.2% recorded in the three months to March. It has helped alleviate concerns that consumer spending - the main driver of UK growth since the financial crisis - has not dried up completely due to the Brexit-linked squeeze on household budgets from weaker wage growth and higher prices. However, it could also stoke concerns at the Bank of England that too many people are living beyond their means as policymakers mull a possible rise in interest rates to combat inflation. ONS senior statistician Kate Davies credited the heatwave across much of the UK for the spurt in sales. She said: ""Today's retail sales figures show overall growth. A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales for the month. ""Looking at the quarterly data, the underlying trend as suggested by the three-month on three-month movement is one of growth, following a fall in quarter one, suggesting a relatively flat first half of 2017."" The data initially helped the pound rise back above the $1.30 level after jitters in early trading. The figures were seen as keeping alive the prospect of a UK interest rate hike as support grows within the Bank of England for an increase. However, a separate release from the ONS this week was seen as damaging the case, as the pace inflation - price increases - was found to have dropped significantly last month. :: Inflation falls unexpectedly as oil costs fall Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We shouldn't get too carried away by these figures. After all, the retail sales figures are very volatile on a month-by-month basis and the heatwave in June provided a boost to clothing sales that may not be sustained. ""Nonetheless, the fact that growth in sales values also accelerated in June suggests that households are not tightening their belts in response to higher inflation or Brexit uncertainty. ""All in all then, after a string of more downbeat news recently, today's figures provide welcome support for our view that the economy should maintain a decent amount of momentum over the coming quarters."""

His doctors in Phoenix said that the 80-year-old is reviewing treatment options that may include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. They added that he is recovering from his surgery ""amazingly well"" at home and that his underlying health is ""excellent"". In a statement, Mr McCain's office said the senator ""appreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days"". They added: ""He is in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family in Arizona. ""He is grateful to the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic for their outstanding care and he is confident that any future treatment will be effective."" :: Devastating diagnosis - McCain's impact on US politics This is not the senator's first experience of cancer - he had several malignant melanomas removed from his skin in the 1990s and 2000s, including an invasive melanoma in 2000. Glioblastomas are particularly aggressive and the American Cancer Society puts the five-year survival rate for patients over 55 at about 4%. But Mr McCain's daughter Meghan described him as ""the toughest person I know"". ""It won't surprise you to learn that in all this, the one of us who is most confident and calm is my father. ""Cancer may afflict him in many ways but it will not make him surrender. Nothing ever has."" Mr McCain has been a Republican senator for six terms and was also a presidential nominee in 2008, losing to Barack Obama. During the campaign in October that year, Mr McCain was approached by a voter who expressed fear that Mr Obama was ""an Arab"". Instead of taking the opportunity to speak badly of his rival, he corrected the lady and replied: ""He's a decent family man and citizen who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that's what this campaign is all about."" On hearing of Mr McCain's medical condition, Mr Obama tweeted: ""John McCain is an American hero and one of the bravest fighters I've ever known. Cancer doesn't know what it's up against - give it hell, John."" As a Navy pilot, Mr McCain was shot down over Vietnam during the war there and was held as prisoner for five years. US President Donald Trump said that the senator ""has always been a fighter"". He added: ""Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy and their entire family. Get well soon."" Mr Trump was criticised for saying during his campaign that McCain was ""not a war hero"", adding: ""I like people who weren't captured"". But the president is well aware that he needs Mr McCain's vote in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described Mr McCain as ""a hero to our Conference and a hero to our country"". Mr McConnell added: ""He has never shied from a fight and I know that he will face this challenge with the same extraordinary courage that has characterised his life."""
2017-07-20,Experts from the 9/11 terror attack have been brought in to help police identify victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170721035802/http://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-fire-911-experts-to-help-identify-victims-10954927,"The Metropolitan Police said the ""extraordinary size"" of the potential crime scene meant those who worked in the aftermath of the 2001 atrocity in the US were being called upon. Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said the 200 UK officers already working on the case were faced with sifting through 15 tonnes of debris on each of the building's 24 floors. Meanwhile, a councillor has been criticised after being spotted repeatedly saying ""don't let them in"" during an emotional meeting over the disaster. Kensington and Chelsea councillor Matthew Palmer was spotted making the remark, amid claims a number of survivors were being kept out of the highly-charged meeting on a fire escape. Deputy leader Kim Taylor-Smith told Sky News he did not think it was the ""right thing"" to make the comment, and stressed the security was handled in conjunction with the police. The new leader of the council rejected calls to resign as she faced cries of ""murderers"" and ""shame on you"" from survivors. Conservative nominee Elizabeth Campbell was formally elected as the new chief of the heavily criticised west London council amid angry scenes. As Tory councillors voted for Ms Campbell, survivors in the public gallery jeered and shouted. The new leader was also booed and heckled again as she addressed Kensington Town Hall. Asked if she had any plans to resign following the meeting, Ms Campbell said: ""No, not yet"". The Conservative councillor replaces former council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown, who resigned in the wake of the fire, in which at least 80 people died. During the stormy meeting, Ms Campbell invited victims, survivors and community groups who wished to speak to contribute. She said: ""We meet at a time of unimaginable grief and sorrow. The Grenfell fire is the biggest civilian disaster in this country for a generation."" As Ms Campbell described how she had spent the past few weeks meeting survivors, the new council leader faced shouts of ""who?"" Ms Campbell admitted the council had ""let down"" the victims of the Grenfell tragedy, adding: ""I am deeply sorry for the grief and trauma you are suffering. ""I am deeply sorry we did not do more to help you when you needed it the most."" Residents used the meeting to express anger that some victims have not yet been buried or identified, as well as asking why survivors are still waiting to be rehoused. Some also described their experience of escaping the devastating blaze on 14 June. One shouted at Ms Campbell: ""You've let the dead down, now you want to come for the living? ""You are not in power, you will not be. The people must choose you and we have not chosen you ... step down and resign."" Another resident said the treatment of the fire victims' families had been ""disgusting"", adding: ""We've been swept under the carpet."" One local, in tears and speaking via a translator, said: ""I beg you, do not play a game with us. I beg you, do not tell us lies. I beg you, do not waste our time."" Robert Atkinson, the leader of the Labour opposition, repeated his party's call for commissioners to take over the running of the Conservative-run authority. He told Ms Campbell she was ""part of the old regime"" and said there was ""nothing"" the Tory council group could do to restore the confidence of locals. His remarks were met with cheers from the public gallery. Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad, also a Labour councillor, branded the council ""not fit for purpose"" as she compared the election of a new leader to the rearranging of deckchairs on the Titanic."

Bennington, who also performed with band Dead by Sunrise, was married and had six children. He died on what would have been the 53rd birthday of his late friend Chris Cornell, the lead singer of Soundgarden and Audioslave, who killed himself in May this year. Bennington's bandmate Mike Shinoda posted on Twitter: ""Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one."" Cornell's wife Vicky wrote: ""Just when I thought my heart couldn't break any more... I love you T."" Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true.  An official statement will come out as soon as we have one. The local coroner's office said Bennington's death ""is being handled as a possible suicide"". A Palos Verdes Estates police spokesperson told Sky News: ""At 8.56 we responded to a call at the 2800 block, Via Victoria. ""This remains under investigation."" Bennington, born in Phoenix, Arizona, battled drug and alcohol addiction at various times throughout his life but in 2011 said he had been sober for six years. He was sexually abused as a child and suffered physical bullying at school, he revealed in interviews. Bennington's children came from his two marriages and a previous relationship, while he also adopted one of his sons. Linkin Park achieved international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory in 2000, which reached number four in the UK charts. The Grammy award-winning band achieved UK number one albums with Meteora in 2003, Minutes to Midnight in 2007, and Living Things in 2012. Five of their singles also reached the top 10 in the UK charts, and they famously collaborated with rapper Jay-Z for 2004 EP Collision Course. They released their latest album One More Light on 19 May this year, two days after Cornell hanged himself in a hotel room. Bennington sang Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah at Cornell's funeral. Linkin Park are currently on a world tour and are scheduled to perform in Massachusetts on 27 July, the night before they are due to co-headline with fellow bands Blink 182 and Wu-Tang Clan at a concert in New York."

Simpson, nicknamed The Juice, responded by saying: ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" The 70-year-old heard the decision by videoconference from Lovelock Correctional Centre, where he has been held since his conviction in 2008. Four parole commissioners in Carson City had heard testimony from Simpson himself, his daughter Arnelle and one of the sports memorabilia dealers he was convicted of robbing in an incident at a Las Vegas hotel room in 2007. ""I've done my time, I've done it as well and respectfully as anyone can,"" Simpson told them. ""None of this would have happened if I'd had better judgement."" Ms Simpson said her father was ""remorseful"" and she wants him to ""come home"". ""The choice that he made nine years ago that resulted in the sentencing, were clearly inappropriate and wrong, and counterproductive to what he was trying to achieve,"" she said. ""As his daughter, I can honestly say, my dad recognises that he took the wrong approach, and could not handle the situation. He could have handled the situation differently."" Bruce Fromong, the robbery victim, said Simpson was a good man who had made a mistake and should now be given a second chance. ""If he called me tomorrow and said 'Bruce I'm getting out, will you pick me up?' Juice I'll be here tomorrow for you. I mean that buddy,"" he said. The parole board said he had complied with prison rules during his time in jail, had no prior criminal convictions and posed a minimal risk to the public. Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of the murders of his ex-wife and her friend in Los Angeles, following a trial watched by millions worldwide. Sky's US correspondent Greg Milam said Simpson is a ""cultural figure"" in America. ""Ever since the trial for the murder of Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman, Simpson has been a controversial figure,"" he said. ""The commissioner says he has received lots of letters for and against Simpson from the public."""

The anti-submarine Type 26 frigate will be the first one built and eventually be the length of 15 buses. It will feature two sonar, a medium-calibre gun, an air defence tower and an ""acoustically quiet hull"" - coming in at £1.23bn per ship. At top speed, the cutting-edge vessel will travel 26+ knots, or just under 30 mph. It will carry a crew of 118 and has a range of 7,000 nautical miles. Three ships have been commissioned so far, with a contract for the further five negotiated in the mid-2020s. The Ministry of Defence declared the work would ""support and sustain"" 3,400 jobs. Speaking at arms firm BAE System's shipyard in Govan, Mr Fallon promised the warships would ""maintain our naval power with a truly global reach"". He said: ""Today marks a historic milestone for the Royal Navy, Scottish shipbuilding and UK defence more widely. ""HMS Glasgow and the other seven frigates in this new class will protect our powerful new aircraft carriers and nuclear deterrent, helping keep Britain safe across the world. The warships are expected to have a service life of 25 years and could be sold on to other countries as exports. Australia has already expressed an interest in them, the MoD said. The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Philip Jones, also spoke at Thursday's ceremony to hail the symbolic importance of the ships. He said: ""The Clyde was the birthplace of some of the greatest fighting ships the world has ever known, and so cutting steel there today for the future HMS Glasgow is symbolic of a Royal Navy on the rise once again. ""As an island nation, we are utterly dependent on the sea for our security and prosperity, and the City-class names have been chosen for the Type 26 to provide an enduring link between the Royal Navy and our great centres of commerce and industry. ""The name Glasgow brings with it a string of battle honours, stretching from the Arctic Circle to the South Atlantic. ""As one of the world's most capable anti-submarine frigates, the Type 26 will carry the Royal Navy's tradition of victory far into the future."""

The singer, who was one of the acts performing in the Leo Ferre festival, is reported to have suffered a cardiac arrest. Some local media has suggested she may have been electrocuted, although this has not been confirmed. Firemen who attended the scene were unable to resuscitate the singer. A formal investigation has now been launched into the cause of her death. Weldens, who grew up in a circus, was an accomplished acrobat, juggler and trapeze artist, performing with her parents before discovering her love of music as a teenager. A talented musician, she also played the piano and acoustic guitar. In 2016, she won first prize in the the Jacques Brel Young Talent Competition, and released her first studio album - with the tongue-in-cheek title Le Grand H De L'homme, which roughly translates as Man with a capital M - in February this year. She was half way though a tour of France and Belgium, which she was due to finish at the end of October."

In the post, the park said six-year-old Xanda, who had several young cubs, was killed on a trophy hunt a few days ago by Zimbabwe professional hunter Richard Cooke. It added: ""We can't believe that now, 2 years since Cecil was killed, that his oldest Cub #Xanda has met the same fate. ""When will the Lions of Hwange National Park be left to live out their years as wild born free lions should...?"" Xanda's father Cecil, a famous and much-loved lion in the park, was killed in 2015 by Walter Palmer, an American dentist. Mr Palmer said his hunt was legal having obtained all the proper permits, but he faced worldwide condemnation and vandals even targeted his home. The 13-year-old lion was decapitated and skinned when he was killed two years ago. Mr Palmer later said he regretted his actions and had not realised the animal was so revered. He said: ""I had no idea that the lion I took was a known, local favorite, was collared and part of a study until the end of the hunt. ""I relied on the expertise of my local professional guides to ensure a legal hunt. ""Again, I deeply regret that my pursuit of an activity I love and practice responsibly and legally resulted in the taking of this lion."" The dentist did not face charges because he had all the necessary paperwork. Zimbabwe's Environment Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri said: ""We approached the police and then the Prosecutor General, and it turned out that Palmer came to Zimbabwe because all the papers were in order."" Mr Palmer is thought to have paid park guides $50,000 to kill Cecil. To mark two years since Cecil was killed, the Lions of Hwange National Park posted a tribute on Facebook on 1 July that said: ""And the fight continues for the plight of lions in Hwange National Park #CecilTheLion."""
2017-07-20,Ben Lindon is about to undergo his 100th round of chemotherapy as part of a long fight with brain cancer. He tells us his story:,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170721035802/http://news.sky.com/story/father-ben-lindon-to-have-100th-round-of-chemotherapy-for-brain-tumour-10955881,"All my life I wanted to be famous. I wanted to be a rock star. Now I could be famous - but for being the youngest person in the UK thought to have received this amount of chemotherapy. So far I've had 99 cycles in nine years - soon to be 100. I was a 29-year-old journalist when I was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in March 2008. I was out running when I had a seizure and collapsed in the street. At the hospital, doctors noticed I had a shadow on my brain and after being referred, I was told I had a grade two glioblastoma brain tumour. I was completely gutted. It's an old cliche, but the rug was pulled out from under my feet. I felt I had been given a death sentence. I didn't deal with it well, I wasn't stoic. The more and more information they gave me, the less and less it made sense. The tumour is just two millimetres in size. But the oncology specialists decided it was too close to my cerebral cortex to operate on, and removing it carried a high chance of death. Instead they decided to ""manage"" the tumour with chemotherapy. The treatment comes in tablet form, every four weeks. I just wake up in the morning and neck them. You are supposed to take them after you've eaten, but I just think to myself, I'll feel ill for a while and then I'll get better. The results are erratic. Often I'm fine, sometimes I suffer overwhelming fatigue and sickness. This latest one - the 99th - has affected me more than any of the other cycles in recent months. Despite the survival rate for my kind of cancer being five years, I'm still here, nine years after diagnosis. I'm lucky. But others may not be as lucky. The amount of funding for research into brain tumours amounts to one percent of the funding for ""big cancers"" such as breast and prostate cancer. We need to change this, particularly as those that suffer the worst from this disease are the most vulnerable: the old and the very young. In simple terms they don't stand a very good chance of survival because so little is known about this disease. Research requires money and it's now one of my jobs to get that money. That is why I'm taking on this mission for Brain Tumour Research. When I kayak 100 miles down the River Wye and into the ocean at Chepstow next month, I will have completed my 100th cycle of chemotherapy. But there is also a selfish reason as to why I am doing this challenge. I was told I couldn't have children due to the aggressive radiotherapy and a lifetime of chemotherapy. But I'm blessed and I have a beautiful four-year-old daughter Martha Rose and a three-year-old mischievous son, Sidney George. I'd like to show them that ordinary people like me can overcome anything, and see beautiful places, if we fight. I'd like to show them that, despite being technically ill, you can do anything. If you can leave a legacy, this is mine and I think it's worth days of kayaking and, potentially, tackling ""trenchfoot of the bum"". I'm finishing this. Two years after a fortnight of seizures which induced a stroke, and even longer since since my physiotherapists told me: ""Stop doing dangerous things"". But I've pledged to raise money for Brain Tumour Research by doing something more challenging each year until I'm broken. I've run marathons, cycled the country and climbed mountains to raise money. And I will continue to do so until I can't."

Many of those who spoke asked Sir Martin to widen the scope of the inquiry to address ""years of neglect"" and ""cultural gentrification"" of the area. Rosemary Mathurin also made suggestions for the direction of the inquiry adding that its chairman ""needs to be of an ethnic background, 100%"". She said: ""There's no way that it can be any other way because only that type of person can be empathetic and actually read into the intellectual conversations of the heart and read the situation that's going on and what people are talking about."" Another resident, who preferred not to be named, accused Sir Martin of failing to give residents enough notice about the consultation meeting. He also expressed anger at the location of the meeting which was around two miles from the Grenfell Tower site. ""We've found out last minute about this vital meeting,"" he said. ""This is really pathetic as a first move in terms of setting up this inquiry. ""You are under a phenomenal degree of scrutiny from this community. ""If you're having a consultation with a group, we all need to be here otherwise you're going to hear about it."" Only around 40 people attended the meeting which was set up for more than double that. Sir Martin admitted that finding an adequate location nearer the scene of the fire was difficult and promised residents that more notice would be given for the remaining consultation meetings. The retired judge and his team were seen taking notes and listening to all speakers including one former Grenfell Tower resident who said her son's father died in the fire because firefighters were unable to identify floor numbers. Speaking after the meeting, Sir Martin said he was ""humbled"" and thanked residents for ""telling him things he didn't know before""."

This is because, according to Dr Fox, there was now ""some uncertainty"" as to whether Brexit Secretary David Davis will be able to conclude a trade deal with the EU by March 2019. Speaking to me at the World Trade Organisation headquarters in Geneva, he said: ""There's been a lot of talk as you know about an implementation period in the UK. :: EU calls for 'clarity' from UK as second round of Brexit talks end ""I don't have a problem with that... Having waited 43 years - another couple of years is, if we can get it to work well for UK and our European partners and for the stability of British business and our prosperity, that seems to me a common sense thing to do."" The International Trade Secretary was continuing the process of re-establishing independent British trade schedules at the Geneva-based organisation, in a meeting with the WTO chief Roberto Azevedo. When asked after a tense press conference in Brussels between Michel Barnier and Mr Davis, whether it was really possible to keep to the timetable of March 2019, Dr Fox expressed doubts about getting a deal signed. ""It's possible. We expect to have our work in Geneva done on time. We expect to have the legislation we need in the UK to get EU law into UK law done on time. ""The bit I think where there's some uncertainty is when will we conclude a free trade agreement with the European Union - that's yet unknown and that's a matter for David Davis and his team to look at and obviously we want to get that done as quickly as possible."""

2017-07-20,Ed Sheeran's promoter and two MPs have been turned away from the London offices of the ticket resale site Viagogo after demanding answers about their business practices.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170721035802/http://news.sky.com/story/ed-sheerans-promoter-and-two-mps-demand-viagogo-answers-10955707,"At one point a security guard threatened to call police as reporters filmed the group trying to deliver a letter to a representative of the site's parent company VGL. The protest was joined by customers who claim they have been ripped off by the company which can add a large fee to a ticket's face value, as well as VAT. Kerry West from Herne Bay in Kent tried to buy four tickets to one of Sheeran's Wembley dates in 2018. Thinking she was on an official website, she was quoted just under £352 for the seats. ""The website is set up to be really, really panicky (with) lots of pop-ups coming up on the screen (saying) you've only got so many minutes left,"" she told Sky News. ""I put all my details in, put my card details in but there was no review screen. I pressed enter and the transaction completed and it came up with a total of £1,889. ""I literally burst into tears, I felt sick. Turned to my husband and said: 'I've been had'."" The company blames a ""glitch"" in the system after hundreds of other customers complained, but many are yet to receive any money back and were even advised to resell the tickets on Viagogo. The singer's promoter, Stuart Galbraith, says tickets for his world tour can only be used by the original purchaser and has so far cancelled 10,000 tickets which have been spotted on resale sites. ""We're advising people don't buy tickets on Viagogo; every single ticket that they sell is not valid for our shows,"" he told Sky News. ""We've also trawled our sales ledgers and we've cross referenced against known touts, identifying seven people who have bought tickets in bulk and we're in the process of cancelling those. ""It is starting to work - we're starting to see tickets disappear off Viagogo as we cancel them."" The industry has long railed against the operations of some secondary ticket portals, claiming the huge mark-ups siphon money from the industry and leave genuine fans out of pocket. There are four big players in the secondary ticket market, two of which are owned by Ticketmaster. Geneva-based Viagogo is the largest. According to the consumer organisation Which?, 49% of customers who use the sites think they are buying from the official seller. On top of that, Viagogo can add as much as 34% in fees - and you do not see the full VAT-inclusive price until you click through to add payment details. The FanFair Alliance pressure group is trying to put pressure on MPs to increase transparency in the market and enforce consumer protection legislation. It also wants Google to stop accepting money from such sites to place their company at the top of internet searches for tickets. The search engine banned similar ads from payday loan companies. Parliament has already changed the law to ban so called ""bots"" which digital touts had used to harvest tickets as soon as they were released in order to resell at a profit. Viagogo is yet to respond to Sky News for a comment."

Mr Collins told Sky News: ""There should be an obligation for these companies to act against that sort of content and material. ""And if they refuse to do that or simply don't have the resources in place to do it - and no one can believe that companies like Facebook can't afford to have the resources in place to combat this material - then I think we should look at the idea of some sort of fines for companies failing to act."" The Sky News investigation revealed dozens of accounts illegally offering prescription drugs - including powerful and addictive tranquilliser, sedatives and opioids for sale. When the accounts were reported, Facebook initially refused to remove them. It was only when Sky News contacted Facebook directly, asking for a comment ahead of broadcasting the story, that the accounts were removed. Facebook refused repeated requests for an interview, and instead issued a statement. ""Buying, selling, or trading prescription drugs isn't allowed on Facebook and we urge people to use our reporting tools if they come across this kind of activity, so we can investigate and take swift action,"" it said. ""We're grateful to Sky News for flagging this content to us and have removed the pages for breaking our standards."" However, Sky News has since found more than two dozen similar drug dealing accounts. We have reported them using Facebook's tools, but as of publication, they remain active. The Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told Sky News that the availability of sedatives, tranquilisers and opioids on the platform ""completely changes the game"". Danny Lee-Frost, head of enforcement at the MHRA, told Sky News: ""The sleeping pills and antidepressants are a lot more dangerous. ""Sleeping pills particularly, they can be addictive. People have committed suicide as the ultimate resort to try and get off them. These are fiercely addictive."""

Under the compensation package, those failed were to get up to £90 for each appointment. The figure includes an extra £30 on top of what the industry safeguards demand. It is the company's second regulatory failing this year. It was forced to pay £9.5m in January for billing issues.

But the UK rejects that, with the Government understood to be bristling at what it sees as ""judicial imperialism"" from Brussels. The issue could thwart the necessary ""substantive progress"" required in the early phase of negotiations to move onto talks about the future trade relationship. It is understood disagreement has also emerged after the UK demanded that British citizens resident in an EU country should have their right to move to any other of the 27 nations enshrined in any settlement - something the EU currently rejects. Many regard Brussels' position as a bargaining tool to get guarantees from the UK on future family members joining EU citizens living in Britain and the export of certain social benefits. Mr Barnier demanded clarification on key points surrounding the financial settlement the EU must make, citizens' rights and Northern Ireland - but acknowledged on the latter issue there was a lot of convergence. It is understood there is also agreement between the two sides on protecting health and pension rights for EU citizens in the UK and British citizens in Europe. But the UK's plans to carry out a basic criminality check on anyone wanting to apply for ""settled status"" to stay in Britain post-Brexit could put it at odds with Europe. On the so-called ""exit bill"", Mr Barnier warned all accounts ""must be settled"", while on citizens' rights he said: ""There does remain one fundamental divergence on the way in which such rights would be guaranteed and on several other points, for example, the rights of future family members or the exports of certain social benefits."" Mr Davis said talks had been ""robust"" but there was much to be ""positive"" about, urging Brussels to show ""flexibility"" Labour said the lack of progress was ""deeply concerning"" and did bode well for the future. While the EU is pressing the UK for further details about its willingness to pay a fee to Brussels, the UK is understood to think the EU team is being unclear on what they believe the legal obligations are over the divorce bill as well, with frustration on both sides. Mr Barnier said: ""A clarification of the UK position is indispensable for us to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers. ""What we want - and we are working on this - is an orderly withdrawal for the United Kingdom, that's decided. An orderly withdrawal means accounts must be settled. ""We know that agreement will not be achieved through incremental steps. As soon as the UK is ready to clarify the nature of its commitments, we will be prepared to discuss this with the British negotiators."" Mr Barnier continued: ""We require this clarification on the financial settlement, on citizens' rights, on Ireland - with the two key points of the common travel area and the Good Friday Agreement - and the other separation issues where this week's experience has quite simply shown we make better progress where our respective positions are clear."" Mr Davis was decidedly more upbeat, saying: ""Overall I'm encouraged by the progress we have made on understanding each other's positions."" He echoed previous comments from Theresa May that the UK had made a ""fair and serious offer"" on citizens' rights and added there were ""many concrete areas where we agree, as well as areas where there will be further discussion"". On the financial settlement, Mr Davis said: ""We both recognise the importance of sorting out the obligations we have to one another, both legally and in a spirit of mutual cooperation."" He added: ""We have had robust but constructive talks this week. ""Clearly there's a lot left to talk about and further work before we can resolve this. Ultimately, getting to a solution will require flexibility from both sides."""

Some 770,000 planes are due to fly through UK airspace from June to August - 40,000 more than the same time last year. In total 2.45 million flights soared through UK skies in 2016. Jamie Hutchison, the director of the National Air Traffic Service (NATS) control base in Swanwick, warned the ""ageing design of UK airspace"" has brought the UK to the limit of its capacity for flights. Mr Hutchison said that today's expected record has not surprised air traffic controllers, who start planning for flights more than a year in advance. ""We work very closely with our airline and airport customers in the run-up to the summer to ensure we have the right planning and resources in place to get people away safely for a well-earned holiday,"" he said. ""It's our busiest time of year and traffic growth is outpacing forecasts year-on-year. ""In the last few weeks we have already safely managed record-breaking daily traffic levels, but the ageing design of UK airspace means we will soon reach the limits of what can be managed without delays rising significantly."" As the skies get more crowded, the Government launched its planned aviation strategy to deal with the next 30 years and beyond. The public is being asked their views on doorstep luggage collection services and town centre check-in desks for passengers flying from British airports. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""As a global, trading nation we want to build on the great industry we have today and create opportunities for people up and down the country. ""Our new aviation strategy will look beyond the new runway at Heathrow and sets out a comprehensive long-term plan for UK aviation. It will support jobs and economic growth across the whole of the UK."" As part of the strategy, a £1bn investment to double the size of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 was announced. Charlie Cornish, the chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, described the investment as a ""significant moment"" demonstrating ""the confidence that we have in the long-term future of both the North and the UK economy"". Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Today's warning from NATS is yet another example of the Government's failure to act and comes as uncertainty over Brexit is threatening the UK aviation industry. ""The Government must listen to what NATS and the industry more broadly are warning and take action to protect and modernise UK airspace."""

In a statement the palace said ""The Duke and Duchess are very pleased to share this lovely picture as they celebrate Prince George's fourth birthday, and would like to thank everyone for all of the kind messages they have received."" It comes at the end of a week-long European tour for William, Kate and their two children. They have visited Poland and Germany over five days on behalf of the foreign office to cement friendships with key EU countries. George had appeared shy and reticent during the European tour, pulling at his father's arm as they faced diplomatic line ups off the plane in Warsaw and Berlin. But he couldn't have been happier when they arrived at Airbus in Hamburg on Friday ahead of flying home. He could not contain his joy when he was taken inside two helicopters on the tarmac, including one like the helicopter Prince William flies for the East Anglian Air Ambulance. At one point Prince George could be seen looking around wide-eyed and clasping his hands to his face in amazement, before then trying on a pilots helmet with the help of his dad. Princess Charlotte however seemed less impressed and threw a tantrum, sitting down next to the helicopter before being coaxed by her mother to get up and walk towards their private plane. In September, Prince George will start at the private school Thomas's Battersea, where fees cost £17,604 a year. The family will also be based at Kensington Palace in London, rather than at their Norfolk mansion Anmer Hall, with William leaving his air ambulance helicopter pilot job this summer to become a full-time royal."

The weak pound versus a basket of international currencies since the referendum means tourists get more value for their money when buying goods and services in the UK. The opposite is true for UK citizens abroad as their spending power drifts. Sky News reported on Thursday how Britons planning summer getaways in the euro area had suffered a pre-trip blow because of the currency reaching an eight-month high against sterling. While their in-resort spending will effectively cost them more, companies like Burberry have been reporting a boost to trade in the UK as luxury goods' costs for people from abroad become more competitive. :: Worldpay board backs £7.7bn Vantiv takeover UK tourism numbers have been rising steadily while the Office for National Statistics has already reported a strong June for the country's retailers. Worldpay pointed to a leap of almost 60% spent in the UK by visitors from the Middle East as Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, fell in the month. It pointed to luxury boutiques and department stores enjoying a 63% increase in sales - aided by citizens of the US and Russia. The company's chief UK marketing officer, James Frost, said: ""Sterling's slump is continuing to attract visitors in their droves, safe in the knowledge that their holiday cash will stretch a little further."" He added: ""It tends to be London that grabs the headlines when it comes to tourist spending, but the reality is destinations right across the UK are benefiting from an influx of free-spending tourists. ""Businesses in Scotland and Wales have already seen foreign spending surge by as much as 27% compared to last year, and this could increase further in July and August.

The serviceman, from Fife in Scotland, disappeared after a night out with friends in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September last year. There is nothing to support any other explanation than Mr McKeague being in a bin that was emptied into a waste lorry shortly after he was last seen, according to Suffolk Police. Detective Superintendent Katie Elliott revealed on Friday the force has ""credible information"" Mr McKeague had been known to go to sleep in rubbish following a night out. She described the failure to find Mr McKeague during the ""unprecedented"" search of the more than 48-hectare landfill site as ""bitterly disappointing"". Det. Supt. Elliott said: ""Without anything further to tell us where he might be on such a vast site the search cannot continue. ""Officers have been finding items such as newspapers and other material that have September 2016 dates on them. This is the time that Corrie went missing. ""Some items have been clearly identifiable as coming from Bury St Edmunds and this has confirmed that we have been searching in the right place, however none of these items have had any link to Corrie."" She added: ""Having been through all of the possibilities in detail, there is nothing to support any theory other than that Corrie was in the bin. ""There are no further sightings of him on CCTV to suggest he left the area, and we have explored the other possibilities as to how he left - such as being taken from the area by someone - and there is no evidence to support that this is the case."" Police discovered the weight of the bin pick-up in Bury St Edmunds on the night Mr McKeague disappeared was much higher than originally thought - at more than 100kg (15st 10lb) compared to the 11kg (1st 10lb) they were first told. Officers working on the search had to be given hydration tablets to combat the risk of heat exhaustion amid summer temperatures. Expertise gathered during the search of the site has been passed onto other police forces, Det. Supt. Elliott said. She added: ""We have been absolutely committed to finding Corrie and none of us wanted to be in this position, where we are unable to provide the answer."" The investigation has cost more than £1.2m to date, with the vast majority of the money spent on rifling through the landfill. Suffolk Police said they remain ""open minded"" and will ""vigorously"" pursue further lines of enquiry should they appear. Mr McKeague's girlfriend April Oliver announced last month the vanished serviceman had become a father with the birth of their daughter. He is stationed at RAF Honington in Suffolk."

Writing in Science Advances journal, a team of US researchers predicted that if current trends continue roughly 12 billion tonnes of plastic waste will be discarded in landfills or polluting the Earth's surface by 2050. Speaking to Sky News, WWF UK chief executive Tanya Steele said a bottle deposit scheme would be a ""first good step"" to address the issue in Britain. She said: ""I think it is good that Mr Gove wants to review it to ensure he can put something forward that we can use. Ultimately we need something that works. ""It is critical we put in place pragmatic things that deal with the scale of the issue."" Earlier this year, Sky launched its Ocean Rescue campaign which is aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the world's seas. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved here."
2017-07-21,OJ Simpson is expected to be released from prison in October after nine years in jail for armed robbery.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170722045351/http://news.sky.com/story/oj-simpson-granted-parole-after-botched-robbery-10955634,"A Nevada parole board decided on Thursday that the former American football and movie star could be freed after serving the minimum term of his 33-year sentence for armed robbery and assault with a weapon. Simpson, nicknamed The Juice, responded by saying: ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" :: OJ Simpson's release: Was it all a foregone conclusion? The 70-year-old heard the decision by video conference from Lovelock Correctional Centre, where he has been held since his conviction in 2008. Four parole commissioners in Carson City had heard testimony from Simpson himself, his daughter Arnelle and one of the sports memorabilia dealers he was convicted of robbing in an incident at a Las Vegas hotel room in 2007. ""I've done my time, I've done it as well and respectfully as anyone can,"" Simpson told them. ""None of this would have happened if I'd had better judgement."" Ms Simpson said her father was ""remorseful"" and she wants him to ""come home"". ""The choices that he made nine years ago that resulted in the sentencing, were clearly inappropriate and wrong, and counterproductive to what he was trying to achieve,"" she said. ""As his daughter, I can honestly say, my dad recognises that he took the wrong approach, and could not handle the situation. He could have handled the situation differently."" Bruce Fromong, the robbery victim, said Simpson was a good man who had made a mistake and should now be given a second chance. ""If he called me tomorrow and said 'Bruce I'm getting out, will you pick me up?' Juice, I'll be here tomorrow for you. I mean that buddy,"" he said. The parole board said Simpson had complied with prison rules during his time in jail, had no prior criminal convictions and posed a minimal risk to the public. Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of the murders of his ex-wife and her friend in Los Angeles, following a trial watched by millions worldwide. Sky's US correspondent Greg Milam said Simpson is a ""cultural figure"" in America. ""Ever since the trial for the murder of Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman, Simpson has been a controversial figure,"" he said. ""The commissioner says he has received lots of letters for and against Simpson from the public."""
2017-07-21,Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington has died aged 41 in an apparent suicide.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170722045351/http://news.sky.com/story/linkin-park-singer-chester-bennington-kills-himself-reports-say-10955603,"The American rock singer was found hanged at his home in California shortly before 9am on Thursday morning, according to website TMZ. Bennington, who also performed with band Dead by Sunrise, was married and had six children. He died on what would have been the 53rd birthday of his late friend Chris Cornell, the lead singer of Soundgarden and Audioslave, who killed himself in May this year. Bennington's bandmate Mike Shinoda posted on Twitter: ""Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one."" Cornell's wife Vicky wrote: ""Just when I thought my heart couldn't break any more... I love you T."" Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true.  An official statement will come out as soon as we have one. The local coroner's office said Bennington's death ""is being handled as a possible suicide"". A Palos Verdes Estates police spokesperson told Sky News: ""At 8.56 we responded to a call at the 2800 block, Via Victoria. ""This remains under investigation."" Bennington, born in Phoenix, Arizona, battled drug and alcohol addiction at various times throughout his life but in 2011 said he had been sober for six years. He was sexually abused as a child and suffered physical bullying at school, he revealed in interviews. Bennington's children came from his two marriages and a previous relationship, while he also adopted one of his sons. Linkin Park achieved international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory in 2000, which reached number four in the UK charts. The Grammy award-winning band achieved UK number one albums with Meteora in 2003, Minutes to Midnight in 2007, and Living Things in 2012. Five of their singles also reached the top 10 in the UK charts, and they famously collaborated with rapper Jay-Z for 2004 EP Collision Course. They released their latest album One More Light on 19 May this year, two days after Cornell hanged himself in a hotel room. Bennington sang Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah at Cornell's funeral. Linkin Park are currently on a world tour and are scheduled to perform in Massachusetts on 27 July, the night before they are due to co-headline with fellow bands Blink 182 and Wu-Tang Clan at a concert in New York."

It comes as a Home Office report reveals there were 123,142 officers across all ranks in England and Wales at the end of March this year - the lowest amount since 1985. Rachel Almeida, Victim Support's head of policy, said the rising crime figures were ""a great cause for concern"". Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on the Government to increase police officer numbers and ""address what people are concerned about"". :: Pressure on police forces sees officers contemplating suicide, says senior detective Office for National Statistics data shows the increase in crime was partly driven by a spike in violence against the person, which soared 18% to 175,060 offences. A long-term decline in the rate of theft was reversed, rising 7% to 118,774, while public order offences jumped 39% to 78,697. Sexual offences were up 14%, public order offences by 39%, while knife and gun crime rose by more than 20%. While the ONS statistics showed a 10% annual rise, the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime, showed a 7% drop. The ONS said the Crime Survey of England and Wales ""doesn't cover all crime and it doesn't cover all victims"", but Number 10 claimed it was the ""more reliable"" measure. Policing minister Nick Hurd told Sky News the ONS figures showed ""real growth in worrying crimes, particularly around violent crimes with knives and guns"". He claimed crime is ""falling but changing"", adding there were ""worrying trends we are absolutely determined to stay on top of"". Asked about the falling numbers of police officers, Mr Hurd said the Government will ""engage very closely with the police, force by force, to really drill down on the pressures they are under"". Earlier this week, it emerged retired Met Police officers had been asked to consider returning to work as force faces ""unprecedented demand"" on its detective capability. It comes four months after a watchdog warned British policing was in a ""potentially perilous"" state and described a shortage of detectives and investigators as a ""national crisis""."
2017-07-21,Ed Sheeran's promoter and two MPs have been turned away from the London offices of the ticket resale site Viagogo after demanding answers about their business practices.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170722045351/http://news.sky.com/story/ed-sheerans-promoter-and-two-mps-demand-viagogo-answers-10955707,"At one point a security guard threatened to call police as reporters filmed the group trying to deliver a letter to a representative of the site's parent company VGL. The protest was joined by customers who claim they have been ripped off by the company which can add a large fee to a ticket's face value, as well as VAT. Kerry West from Herne Bay in Kent tried to buy four tickets to one of Sheeran's Wembley dates in 2018. Thinking she was on an official website, she was quoted just under £352 for the seats. ""The website is set up to be really, really panicky (with) lots of pop-ups coming up on the screen (saying) you've only got so many minutes left,"" she told Sky News. ""I put all my details in, put my card details in but there was no review screen. I pressed enter and the transaction completed and it came up with a total of £1,889. ""I literally burst into tears, I felt sick. Turned to my husband and said: 'I've been had'."" The company blames a ""glitch"" in the system after hundreds of other customers complained, but many are yet to receive any money back and were even advised to resell the tickets on Viagogo. The singer's promoter, Stuart Galbraith, says tickets for his world tour can only be used by the original purchaser and has so far cancelled 10,000 tickets which have been spotted on resale sites. ""We're advising people don't buy tickets on Viagogo; every single ticket that they sell is not valid for our shows,"" he told Sky News. ""We've also trawled our sales ledgers and we've cross referenced against known touts, identifying seven people who have bought tickets in bulk and we're in the process of cancelling those. ""It is starting to work - we're starting to see tickets disappear off Viagogo as we cancel them."" The industry has long railed against the operations of some secondary ticket portals, claiming the huge mark-ups siphon money from the industry and leave genuine fans out of pocket. There are four big players in the secondary ticket market, two of which are owned by Ticketmaster. Geneva-based Viagogo is the largest. According to the consumer organisation Which?, 49% of customers who use the sites think they are buying from the official seller. On top of that, Viagogo can add as much as 34% in fees - and you do not see the full VAT-inclusive price until you click through to add payment details. The FanFair Alliance pressure group is trying to put pressure on MPs to increase transparency in the market and enforce consumer protection legislation. It also wants Google to stop accepting money from such sites to place their company at the top of internet searches for tickets. The search engine banned similar ads from payday loan companies. Parliament has already changed the law to ban so called ""bots"" which digital touts had used to harvest tickets as soon as they were released in order to resell at a profit. Viagogo is yet to respond to Sky News for a comment."

The sequence of verbatim accounts leaked by fellow Cabinet ministers has little precedent, like much in politics these days. The PM, though, will be obliged to tell her own Cabinet to pipe down and concentrate on serving the country. :: May to bickering Tories: It's me or Corbyn Some MPs feel a stronger prime minister would have fired the likely suspects, particularly as the Cabinet Secretary circulated in December an irate memo demanding that leakers, including ministers, be fired, even when the leaks did not include issues of national security. That memo was itself leaked. In truth, the attempt to undermine the Chancellor has somewhat backfired. He is unsackable because of this, and the noises off, are more of a sign of an argument going his way rather than the way of the leakers. The Chancellor has backed leaving the single market and the customs union, but has stressed the protection of jobs in a transition period. He is backed across industry and finance by businesspeople for whom the sunny rhetoric of pro-Brexit Cabinet minister no longer cuts the mustard (if it ever did). These decision makers will have to make investment decisions at board meetings for their 2018/19 financial year in the coming weeks and months. That period includes the March 2019 likely date of Brexit, and therefore against a backdrop of this squabbling and of Cabinet ministers telling the EU to ""go whistle"" - they have to make judgements about the likelihood of a no deal Brexit. This domestic political chaos is of course noticed in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. Where the PM had hoped for a cast iron strengthened hand in Brexit negotiations, she now struggles to maintain the unity of even her two dozen Cabinet ministers. The Government is consciously avoiding votes in the Commons and is attempting to limit the opportunity for votes to be brought by the Opposition and by backbench MPs too. It has also allowed Justine Greening to take from her capital budget to fund real terms protection for per capita schools spending in England. The recess cannot come quickly enough for the Government or the Prime Minister. Regroup and rest is the message. The danger is that the logic of leadership challenges will fester among a disgruntled Cabinet as they escape a torrid few months of politics. A period of political silence might well benefit the Government, but it cannot last, particularly as Brexit negotiations continue next month."
2017-07-21,"Camden Council has insisted it is safe for residents to return to their flats in the Chalcots Estate, after four weeks of urgent safety works.

Inspection teams found multiple fire safety failures within the buildings, as well as identifying problems with the external cladding, which failed combustibility tests. The council has now said it is safe to return to the building, but many residents are unhappy with the quality of the work. Steve Pirolli and his family have lived on the fourth floor of Taplow Tower for 17 years. He showed us some of the work carried out inside, including new sealant around fire doors, extra fire exit signs and expandable foam around gas pipes. ""To be honest the work they've done is just shoddy, it's really, really shoddy and I've spoke to people in the building trade that renovate houses into student flats and they have to have everything has to be exactly right, and they say the work is just Mickey Mouse,"" Steve explained. Another resident, 72-year-old Shirley Phillips, who featured on Sky News the night the towers were evacuated, is also unhappy. She and her dog Tilly spent the night outside after being told to leave her flat. But four weeks in a hotel room have caused Shirley immense stress. ""It's been awful"" she said tearfully. ""I get up with a headache and it just doesn't go away, even taking tablets."" Like other residents, Shirley doesn't think the work is good enough. ""They reckon it's going to take another six weeks to get the fire doors and possibly another nine months before the cladding's removed, so how is that safe?"" she said. Some residents are reportedly refusing to return until the council provides independent assurance the blocks are safe. They are advising other unhappy tenants to contact local solicitors. In a statement the Leader of Camden Council, Georgia Gould, said: ""We will go over and above these works to enhance safety measures, but the London Fire Brigade have informed us that they are content that sufficient progress has been made to allow a phased return home for residents. ""We'll continue to work relentlessly, floor by floor, until the works the fire brigade have specified are complete."" It's still unclear when the cladding will be removed. Across England, 263 residential buildings failed combustibility tests. The work to replace or remove cladding will take months. As people return to their homes in Camden, many are still questioning how safe they are living in tower blocks."
2017-07-21,"Michael Gove has confirmed that the Cabinet supports a transition period after Britain leaves the EU, in which free movement may continue for several years.

It appears to signal a significant shift compared with earlier in the year when Brexit-leaning cabinet ministers were opposed to a long transition phase after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Cabinet sources claimed today that an implementation period of between two and four years had now been agreed by Cabinet ministers. Mr Gove, who has recently rejoined the Cabinet, would not be drawn on whether he or the Government supported such a timetable. As the architect of the Vote Leave campaign, he had been a hawk on the subject of controlling migration - promising when he ran for the Conservative leadership last summer that he wanted to see free movement end and ""numbers go down"". But on Friday, speaking at an event in Woking in Surrey, he said: ""I think the judgment we need to make about future migration policy should be shaped by what's in the interests of our economy, consistent with recognising the instruction the British people gave us last year."" Mr Gove added that it was important to ""honour the referendum result"" by controlling immigration but suggested this did not need to happen immediately. Speaking to Sky News he also suggested seasonal workers from the EU would be exempt from the Government's target to reduce net migration to tens of thousands. The National Farmers Union have said they would need 90,000 seasonal workers a year by 2021 to stop food ""rotting in the fields"". Fellow Brexiteer Liam Fox on Thursday revealed he was also prepared to wait ""another couple of years"" for a full separation from Brussels - having earlier said such a period should last only a few months. Downing Street pointed out that Theresa May had opened the door to a transition period in her Lancaster House speech in January when she outlined her Brexit priorities and that she was keen to avoid a ""cliff edge"" for businesses. But the terms of any such deal are likely to be viewed with suspicion by hardline Eurosceptics. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said calls for a transition period were an attempt to overturn the result of last year's referendum. ""If we are subject to the rules of the single market and the regulations of the single market, and subject to the fiat of the European Court of Justice, we are paying for the privilege and we can't do free trade deals with the rest of the world, then we are in the EU,"" he told BBC2's Newsnight. ""In the old and tired phrase, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."" UKIP's interim leader Steve Crowther said: ""Extending freedom of movement for two, three or four years produces no obvious benefit to anyone. It is an EU principle, so ending it in 2019 or 2023 makes no difference to them."""

Many of those who spoke asked Sir Martin to widen the scope of the inquiry to address ""years of neglect"" and ""cultural gentrification"" of the area. Rosemary Mathurin also made suggestions for the direction of the inquiry adding that its chairman ""needs to be of an ethnic background, 100%"". She said: ""There's no way that it can be any other way because only that type of person can be empathetic and actually read into the intellectual conversations of the heart and read the situation that's going on and what people are talking about."" Another resident, who preferred not to be named, accused Sir Martin of failing to give residents enough notice about the consultation meeting. He also expressed anger at the location of the meeting which was around two miles from the Grenfell Tower site. ""We've found out last minute about this vital meeting,"" he said. ""This is really pathetic as a first move in terms of setting up this inquiry. ""You are under a phenomenal degree of scrutiny from this community. ""If you're having a consultation with a group, we all need to be here otherwise you're going to hear about it."" Only around 40 people attended the meeting which was set up for more than double that. Sir Martin admitted that finding an adequate location nearer the scene of the fire was difficult and promised residents that more notice would be given for the remaining consultation meetings. The retired judge and his team were seen taking notes and listening to all speakers including one former Grenfell Tower resident who said her son's father died in the fire because firefighters were unable to identify floor numbers. Speaking after the meeting, Sir Martin said he was ""humbled"" and thanked residents for ""telling him things he didn't know before""."

Ms Gollop said: ""Almost all the medical evidence in this case makes for sad reading."" It is understood Charlie's parents had not seen details of the latest MRI scan and reacted badly when it was revealed in court. Charlie's mother, Connie Yates, began to cry and said: ""We haven't even read it."" His father Chris Gard looked directly at the Great Ormond Street lawyer and said ""evil"" before they stormed out. The emotional scenes led Ms Gollop to add: ""I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to cause distress."" The couple's barrister Grant Armstrong said Ms Gallop should not have broken the news about the scan before Charlie's parents had read the report. A judge at the High Court has been hearing evidence about the potential of an experimental treatment that it is claimed could help the baby. Charlie's parents want permission to take him to America to try the treatment but Great Ormond Street says it would not help him. They have also been unable to persuade European Court of Human Rights judges to intervene. The couple, from Bedfont, west London, say there is new evidence and want Mr Justice Francis to carry out a fresh analysis of their case. The judge ruled in April in favour of the hospital and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. American specialist, Michio Hirano, a professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, travelled to London this week to examine Charlie for the first time and discuss the case with Great Ormond Street doctors. He has offered to provide treatment that may improve Charlie's rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. Mr Armstrong told the judge that a ""range of opinions"" had been expressed when experts gathered at Great Ormond Street. But Ms Gollop said: ""We don't yet have any of this apparent new evidence."" Lawyers have said they will examine data from new scans and reports from discussions at Great Ormond Street on Charlie over the weekend. Mr Justice Francis has told Charlie's parents that he will not re-run the case but will consider any ""new material"". The judge will consider their latest claims at a hearing starting on Monday after examining preliminary issues on Friday when he was told about the scan.More follows..."

She died from a gunshot wound to the abdomen, from a bullet fired by police office Mohamed Noor as she approached the responding police car while dressed in her pyjamas. Her death has been met with shock and anger in the US and in Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull described it as ""inexplicable"". Speaking to reporters for the first time since the incident, Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau apologised to Ms Damond's fiance Don for his loss. She said: ""Based on the publicly released information from the BCA (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension), this should not have happened. ""On our squad cars you will find the words: To protect with courage and serve with compassion. ""This did not happen. ""Having the information that is publicly available right now, while recognising there is an open BCA investigation, I believe the actions in question go against who we are as a department, how we train, and the expectations we have for our officers."" She said that Noor's actions were those of ""one individual"" and that he and his partner should have had their body cameras switched on. The department is looking at technology whereby the cameras could switch on automatically, she added. Her words come just hours after it was confirmed that the Damond family has hired lawyer Bob Bennett. Mr Bennett reached a settlement of nearly $3m for the family of Philando Castile, a black man killed by police during a traffic stop. Mr Bennett told Reuters that the family want to wait until the incident has been investigated before deciding whether to launch a civil lawsuit. He added: ""Usually people who call the police in their pyjamas are not ambushers, especially spiritual healers and pacifists."" Ms Damond, while trained as a vet, worked in the US as a life coach and meditation teacher. ""You shouldn't shoot unarmed people who call the cops,"" he added. Noor has refused to be interviewed by investigators at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is within his rights. But a statement released through his lawyer passed on his condolences to Ms Damond's family. He did not give any details about the shooting, however. Ms Damond's death is the third at the hands of Minnesota police in less than two years."
2017-07-21,"When Vince Cable appeared on TV's Strictly Come Dancing in 2010, he danced the foxtrot.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170722045351/http://news.sky.com/story/vince-cable-lib-dem-leader-economic-guru-and-romantic-novelist-10954630,"Now he's waltzed into the leadership of the Liberal Democrats unopposed, but with a band of just 12 MPs. At 74, he's his party's oldest ever leader. He's six years older then Jeremy Corbyn and three years older than Donald Trump. In fact, he's the oldest leader of a UK political party since Sir Winston Churchill, who was 80 when he stepped down as Conservative leader. Sir Vince started his political career in the Labour Party, as a councillor in Glasgow and then parliamentary candidate in York in 1970. He joined the breakaway SDP in the early 1980s and eventually became a Lib Dem when the party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988. In the 1970s, he was a special adviser in Whitehall to John Smith, who later became Labour leader. And before becoming MP for Twickenham in 1997, he was chief economist for Shell. As a keen ballroom dancer, it's perhaps not surprising he's a romantic at heart. Since his first wife died and he remarried, he has worn both his wedding rings. He'll certainly need all his charm to woo voters in the months and years ahead. His leadership will no doubt be defined by his party's ability to influence the Brexit process. He faces daunting challenges. For a start, now the Lib Dems are no longer the third biggest party in the Commons, their leader is rarely called during Prime Minister's Questions. Secondly, according to party grandees, he needs to concentrate on big issues, like Brexit and the economy, and not get drawn into rows over issues like gay sex, as his predecessor Tim Farron did. ""His tremendous advantage is his experience, so his age isn't a drawback,"" said a grandee who worked with Lib Dem leaders Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy, Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg. On Brexit, Sir Vince has expressed the controversial view in recent weeks that it may not go ahead. And he wants a second referendum. ""I'm beginning to think that Brexit may never happen,"" he said earlier this month. ""The problems are so enormous, the divisions within the two main parties are so enormous I can see a scenario in which this doesn't happen."" On the economy, his supporters claim he predicted the 2008 financial crash coming. Now he thinks income tax should rise to pay for health and social care. He has represented his party at PMQs before, with spectacular success, notably in November 2007 when Gordon Brown was in trouble over party donations, the Northern Rock crisis and other problems. ""The House has noticed the Prime Minister's remarkable transformation in the past few weeks from Stalin to Mr Bean, creating chaos out of order, rather than order out of chaos,"" he said, prompting howls of laughter from MPs on all sides. Sir Vince's supporters in his party claim his five years as business secretary in David Cameron's coalition government make him the Lib Dems' best qualified leader of modern times. They point out that his reputation as a wise economic guru and sage means he is constantly in demand for TV and radio interviews, which will greatly raise the profile of his party now he is leader. But his critics claim there are serious blemishes in his record in the coalition government too, the most obvious being the Lib Dems' tuition fees betrayal when he was the Secretary of State responsible for the U-turn. He also blundered when he told undercover reporters he had ""declared war on Rupert Murdoch"" in his BskyB takeover bid, forcing David Cameron to strip him of his responsibility for the bid and all media issues. As Lib Dem leader, however, it is Brexit that Sir Vince is now about to declare war on. And with his profile already much higher than Tim Farron's, Remainers will see his election as a boost for their fight. But how long will Sir Vince stay on taking the lead in his party? His political dance partner, new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, is half his age at 37 and it's thought he'll take a bow and let her step up before the next election. Away from politics, his romantic instincts aren't just confined to ballroom dancing. Less well known than his appearance on ""Strictly"" is the fact that he has become a romantic novelist. Yes, really. After writing several books about the economy, his first novel Open Arms, said to be a political thriller and love story set in a post-Brexit future, is due to be published in September. Asked in a recent interview if it's about ""sex and political intrigue"", he said: ""It is not actually about sex. The sex is very discreet, it is not going to win the bad sex award."" So if you thought the 74-year-old new Lib Dem leader was just a stuffy old economist obsessed with Brexit, you'd be wrong. It seems he's also a racy romantic. As they might say on ""Strictly"": Cha, Cha, Cha!"

Boots faced criticism after refusing to reduce the cost of the morning-after pill over fears it could incentivise its use. A spokesman for the chain said: ""Pharmacy and care for customers are at the heart of everything we do and as such we are truly sorry that our poor choice of words in describing our position on emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) has caused offence and misunderstanding, and we sincerely apologise."" Boots charges £28.25 for Levonelle emergency contraceptive and £26.75 for its own version, while Tesco charges £13.50 for Levonelle and Superdrug £13.49 for a generic product. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which launched the campaign calling on Boots to reduce the price tag on the emergency contraceptive, found the progestogen-based pills can cost up to five times more in the UK than other parts of Europe. Boots said its price tag was based on the cost of the medicine and the consultation the pharmacists carries out with women but it is ""committed"" to finding less expensive versions of the tablet.

2017-07-21,"The pound has tumbled to an eight-month low against the euro, spelling higher costs for British holidaymakers getting ready for summer breaks.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170722045351/http://news.sky.com/story/pound-tumbles-to-eight-month-low-against-the-euro-10955383,"Sterling slipped close to €1.11 as the euro strengthened in reaction to remarks by European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi while the UK currency was again buffeted by fears over Brexit. The pound's dip - of as much as two cents - took it to its lowest level since November 2016. It will weaken the spending power of British families preparing to flock to Spanish beaches and French campsites when school holidays begin later this week. Sterling was also lower against the US dollar - at a time when Washington is undergoing its own political turbulence - dipping below $1.30 after spending several days above that level. But it was the strong performance of the euro that was mainly making waves on currency markets. It shot higher against the dollar as well as the pound despite the ECB marking no change to interest rates or wider monetary policy guidance at its latest meeting. Traders seized on comments by Mr Draghi that policy makers would discuss changes to its €2tn stimulus programme in the autumn. The euro has been strengthening recently as signs of an economic recovery on the single currency bloc increase speculation about tightening policy. Ultra-low interest rates and a huge programme of bond-purchasing, or quantitative easing - effectively pumping money into the economy - were put in place when the economy was in a much more fragile state. An upturn and return to normality should put an end to the need for this support - and the withdrawal of the stimulus will make the currency a more attractive bet. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said Mr Draghi's comments were his way of endorsing the recent upward trend for the euro - without announcing anything new. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct, said: ""No news means no change in the euro's trend, which for now is higher."" Meanwhile on Thursday, the pound was under pressure as ""fundamental"" differences over EU citizens' rights and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice emerged following Brexit talks. Elsewhere, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said a bespoke trade deal between Britain and the European Union should be ""one of the easiest in human history"" to reach but that Britain could ""survive"" without an agreement. Earlier, the pound had been buoyed by better than expected official figures on retail sales for June, before the gains faded."
2017-07-21,Holidaymakers are being warned about the nasty side effects and long-term scarring that can be caused from black henna tattoos.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170722045351/http://news.sky.com/story/pain-and-scarring-warning-over-chemical-filled-black-henna-tattoos-10957085,"James Colley, 18, went to Zante after finishing his exams earlier this month and decided to get one. As a boxing fan, he chose a similar style tattoo to Mike Tyson, who has a distinctive pattern on the left hand side of his face. However, James's became infected and he was rushed to hospital, where doctors told him that he could be left with facial scarring for up to five years. He said the only option was to have the henna bleached off. James told Sky News: ""I went on a lads' holiday. Two days in I saw people getting henna and thought it was a good idea... but it flared up and when I turned up at the hospital she laid me down and told me to relax. ""She bleached the skin and said 'we can stop now if you want'. The pain was really bad, I thought I was going to pass out. ""I would say if you want to get a henna tattoo do your research. Get it done in a proper place with brown henna. It's not worth the risk of getting it bleached off. The pain isn't worth it. It's not."" Traditional brown henna tattoos are usually harmless, but the black ones sometimes contain chemicals, that can react with the skin. Of 288 dermatologists who took part in the Skin Health Alliance 2017 Dermatologist Survey, 72% said they thought the number of incidents where patients had reacted badly to black henna tattoos was increasing year on year. Now there is a warning from the British Skin Foundation. Consultant dermatologist Dr Anjani Mahto said: ""I think the best advice really would be that you're best not getting them, simply because you do not know what is in a lot of these products outside the UK. ""You can't predict who is going to get a reaction and who is not, but if there is any risk of black henna or black henna dye, then its best avoided."" When he returned from his holiday, James tweeted a before and after picture of his tattoo, hoping to warn others about the possible side effects. It has now been shared more than 14,000 times. Farrah Illahi, who is a henna teacher and runs Visible Changes beautician in Cardiff, said: ""Basically people should have a skin test before getting henna. ""With black henna, because there are chemicals in it, you can get a reaction. But with natural or organic henna you can't get an infection so I advise people to get that one."" For James, what started out as a bit of post-exam holiday fun with friends turned into something far more serious. He now wants others to learn from what he's been through."
2017-07-21,A 27-year-old man has admitted murdering his brother and attempting to murder his brother's girlfriend in a house fire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170722045351/http://news.sky.com/story/brother-admits-murder-over-glasgow-house-fire-10956135,"Blair Logan poured petrol on his younger brother Cameron, 23, and Rebecca Williams as they slept at the family home in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, in the early hours of 1 January. The couple had been at a New Year's Eve party and had walked to the family home before the fire was started at 7.25am. Ms Williams was taken to hospital after being rescued by her boyfriend's father and neighbours who rushed to help. Logan's parents David and Catherine were treated for smoke inhalation. The family dog, Gomez, was also killed in the fire. Logan pleaded guilty to a charge of murder and attempted murder at the High Court in Glasgow on Friday. He has been subject to two psychiatric reports which concluded there was not sufficient evidence for a plea of diminished responsibility. He was also charged with endangering the lives of his parents, who were in the court room along with Ms Williams, as the guilty plea was made. On the night of the fire, Mrs Logan was woken by the family dog whining and went downstairs, where she saw a figure in dark clothing standing in the living room. Alex Prentice QC, prosecuting, told the court: ""Catherine Logan then heard Cameron roar in surprise, shock and fear, before the accused made a jerking motion with his arm as if throwing something. ""The accused then ran from the living room and went out the front door. ""Catherine Logan slammed the door behind him, shouting something like 'get the hell out of my house', still not knowing who it was. ""When she turned back towards the living room she saw 'orange and crackling' and the room turning black. She also heard Cameron and Rebecca screaming."" Mrs Logan could not open the door to the room so she ran outside to ask neighbours for help, shouting out for her husband who also tried to get into the living room but was beaten back by the smoke and fire. Ms Williams managed to roll on to the floor and crawl into the kitchen where she put her head in the fridge to protect herself from the fire. As well as burns to her arms and face, Ms Williams also suffered damage to her throat, vocal cords and lungs. She has undergone surgery four times, including a tracheostomy procedure, where an opening is created at the front of the neck so a tube can be inserted into the windpipe to help you breathe. The tracheostomy may be permanent, and the potential long-term damage to the lungs is not known. She may not be able to return to work as a broadcast journalist due to the damage caused. Logan was said to have had a ""hostile relationship"" with his brother and the attack was said to be in retaliation for a recent incident at the house when his brother had punched him. Searches of Logan's computer revealed he had researched burn injuries. After his arrest, Logan told police: ""It was not my intent to kill him but I did do it."" When charged with the attempted murder of Ms Williams, he said: ""I thought she was out of the room"", and added: ""I did not wish to murder my parents."" Defence lawyer Shelagh McCall said Logan showed ""wicked recklessness"" but did not intend to kill his brother. He was said to have ""felt physically sick at the whole thing"". Ms McCall said there were ""unusual traits"" in Logan's personality and that he had a lack of understanding of the impact of his actions on other people. Logan will be sentenced on 11 August."
2017-07-21,Ben Lindon is about to undergo his 100th round of chemotherapy as part of a long fight with brain cancer. He tells us his story:,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170722045351/http://news.sky.com/story/father-ben-lindon-to-have-100th-round-of-chemotherapy-for-brain-tumour-10955881,"All my life I wanted to be famous. I wanted to be a rock star. Now I could be famous - but for being the youngest person in the UK thought to have received this amount of chemotherapy. So far I've had 99 cycles in nine years - soon to be 100. I was a 29-year-old journalist when I was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in March 2008. I was out running when I had a seizure and collapsed in the street. At the hospital, doctors noticed I had a shadow on my brain and after being referred, I was told I had a grade two glioblastoma brain tumour. I was completely gutted. It's an old cliche, but the rug was pulled out from under my feet. I felt I had been given a death sentence. I didn't deal with it well, I wasn't stoic. The more and more information they gave me, the less and less it made sense. The tumour is just two millimetres in size. But the oncology specialists decided it was too close to my cerebral cortex to operate on, and removing it carried a high chance of death. Instead they decided to ""manage"" the tumour with chemotherapy. The treatment comes in tablet form, every four weeks. I just wake up in the morning and neck them. You are supposed to take them after you've eaten, but I just think to myself, I'll feel ill for a while and then I'll get better. The results are erratic. Often I'm fine, sometimes I suffer overwhelming fatigue and sickness. This latest one - the 99th - has affected me more than any of the other cycles in recent months. Despite the survival rate for my kind of cancer being five years, I'm still here, nine years after diagnosis. I'm lucky. But others may not be as lucky. The amount of funding for research into brain tumours amounts to one percent of the funding for ""big cancers"" such as breast and prostate cancer. We need to change this, particularly as those that suffer the worst from this disease are the most vulnerable: the old and the very young. In simple terms they don't stand a very good chance of survival because so little is known about this disease. Research requires money and it's now one of my jobs to get that money. That is why I'm taking on this mission for Brain Tumour Research. When I kayak 100 miles down the River Wye and into the ocean at Chepstow next month, I will have completed my 100th cycle of chemotherapy. But there is also a selfish reason as to why I am doing this challenge. I was told I couldn't have children due to the aggressive radiotherapy and a lifetime of chemotherapy. But I'm blessed and I have a beautiful four-year-old daughter Martha Rose and a three-year-old mischievous son, Sidney George. I'd like to show them that ordinary people like me can overcome anything, and see beautiful places, if we fight. I'd like to show them that, despite being technically ill, you can do anything. If you can leave a legacy, this is mine and I think it's worth days of kayaking and, potentially, tackling ""trenchfoot of the bum"". I'm finishing this. Two years after a fortnight of seizures which induced a stroke, and even longer since since my physiotherapists told me: ""Stop doing dangerous things"". But I've pledged to raise money for Brain Tumour Research by doing something more challenging each year until I'm broken. I've run marathons, cycled the country and climbed mountains to raise money. And I will continue to do so until I can't."

Soon after, they were confronted by four enforcement officers from Tower Hamlets Council, who handed the pair a £150 fine for trading without a permit. Mr Spicer, a professor at City University, said his five-year-old daughter burst into tears and said: ""I've done a bad thing."" ""It's not like she was trying to make a massive profit, this is just a five-year-old kid trying to sell lemonade,"" he told the Evening Standard. ""She was very upset because she was proud of selling it, and this really soured the experience."" After being approached by the council officers, Mr Spicer and his daughter packed up and went home. He added: ""Things like this are common in America... when I shared our experience with my cousin who lives in Chicago, he told me this would be a national scandal."" A spokeswoman for Tower Hamlets Council said the fine would be cancelled and an apology would be issued to Mr Spicer and his daughter. She said: ""We are very sorry that this has happened. ""We expect our enforcement officers to show common sense, and to use their powers sensibly. ""This clearly did not happen."""

Baroness Brenda Hale of Richmond, 72, who is currently deputy president of the Supreme Court, succeeds Lord Neuberger. The Yorkshire-born judge said in a statement: ""It is a great honour and a challenge to be appointed to succeed Lord Neuberger. ""I look forward to building upon his pioneering achievements, including developing closer links with each part of the United Kingdom, for example by sitting outside London, and improving the ways in which we communicate our work to the public. ""While I of course look forward to working alongside all my colleagues, it is a particular pleasure for me to be taking up the post at the same time as we welcome only the second ever woman to sit on the UK's top appeal court."" Lord Neuberger, who has been at the helm since 2012, welcomed the appointment. ""For Lady Hale to become President of the institution to which she has contributed so much is a fitting pinnacle to a truly ground-breaking career,"" he said. Lady Hale becomes the third person to hold the position since the Supreme Court was established in 2009. It replaced the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords as the highest court in the UK, separating the court from both Government and Parliament. The Supreme Court consists of 11 justices and is the final court of appeal in all UK civil cases and criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The most recent high-profile Supreme Court case was the Article 50 Brexit appeal, when the court decided that Theresa May needed Parliament's approval before triggering the formal process for the UK to leave the European Union."

Two male tourists from Turkey and Sweden died after the walls of a bar in Kos broke apart and crashed down on revellers. Dozens of aftershocks have been reported, while the quake also caused small tsunamis in Kos and Gumbet, a Turkish coastal town. In the Turkish resort of Bodrum, around 70 people were taken to hospital, having been injured as they tried to escape the quake. Giorgos Kyritsis, mayor of Kos, told Greek media: ""The buildings affected were mostly old and were built before the earthquake building codes were introduced."" The army has been called on to help emergency services, he added. Of those injured, two or three are in a serious condition and undergoing surgery, regional officials said. Tourist Tom Perry-Fox was on the second floor of his Kos hotel when the quake struck. He told Sky News that the experience was ""pretty surreal, like a movie"". ""You're scared for your life, you don't know what's happening. ""The floor is vibrating like you wouldn't believe."" Lauren Duffy, a 20-year-old student from Merseyside, was evacuated along with her mother and sister from the Atlantis Hotel, which was strewn with shattered glass. She said: ""We were asleep in our hotel room when we were woken by really violent shaking, and we all were screaming and told to evacuate from the hotel."" Meanwhile, Christopher Hackland, from Edinburgh, was among hundreds of tourists who spent the night outdoors after the quake. He said: ""The instant reaction was to get ourselves out of the (hotel) room. There was banging. There was shaking. ""The light was swinging, banging on the ceiling, crockery falling out of the cupboards, and pans were making noise. ""There was a lot of screaming and crying and hysterics coming from the hotel. ""It felt like being at a theme park with one of the illusions, an optical illusion where you feel like you're upside down."" Greece and Turkey lie in an especially earthquake-prone zone and have felt several tremors in recent weeks. The quake hit just six miles deep, according to the US Geological Survey. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are speaking to the Turkish and Greek authorities following an earthquake off the coast of Bodrum and near the island of Kos.

Shouting and swearing could be heard over the sounds of banging and barking dogs, as elite teams trained to respond to riots piled out from the vehicles with backpacks of equipment. Shots were heard from the affected wing until around midnight and the prison is now fully under the control of authorities. A small number of prisoners reportedly attempted to damage the wing of the prison after refusing to follow the orders of prison officers in charge. A Prison Service spokesperson said the unrest posed no danger to the public and that the offenders involved would be ""punished"" with ""extra time behind bars"". The incident comes little more than a week after the acting head of the Prison Officers' Association warned that levels of violence in prisons were ""absolutely horrendous"". A Sky News Freedom of Information request found that tornado officers are being called to deal with an increasing number of serious incidents - 16 in 2016 compared with just three in 2011. A recent inspection report described HMP Hewell as facing ""many challenges"". Chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said the jail had levels of violence that were ""far too high"" and faced serious issues with ""safety and respect"". Inspectors to the prison had also found increased levels of self-harm and reported that a quarter of prisoners ""felt unsafe"" in the jail."

Ms Gollop said: ""Almost all the medical evidence in this case makes for sad reading."" It is understood Charlie's parents had not seen details of the latest MRI scan and reacted badly when it was revealed in court. Charlie's mother, Connie Yates, began to cry and said: ""We haven't even read it."" His father Chris Gard looked directly at the Great Ormond Street lawyer and said ""evil"" before they stormed out. The emotional scenes led Ms Gollop to add: ""I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to cause distress."" The couple's barrister Grant Armstrong said Ms Gallop should not have broken the news about the scan before Charlie's parents had read the report. A judge at the High Court has been hearing evidence about the potential of an experimental treatment that it is claimed could help the baby. Charlie's parents want permission to take him to America to try the treatment but Great Ormond Street says it would not help him. They have also been unable to persuade European Court of Human Rights judges to intervene. The couple, from Bedfont, west London, say there is new evidence and want Mr Justice Francis to carry out a fresh analysis of their case. The judge ruled in April in favour of the hospital and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. American specialist, Michio Hirano, a professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, travelled to London this week to examine Charlie for the first time and discuss the case with Great Ormond Street doctors. He has offered to provide treatment that may improve Charlie's rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. Mr Armstrong told the judge that a ""range of opinions"" had been expressed when experts gathered at Great Ormond Street. But Ms Gollop said: ""We don't yet have any of this apparent new evidence."" Lawyers have said they will examine data from new scans and reports from discussions at Great Ormond Street on Charlie over the weekend. Mr Justice Francis has told Charlie's parents that he will not re-run the case but will consider any ""new material"". The judge will consider their latest claims at a hearing starting on Monday after examining preliminary issues on Friday when he was told about the scan.More follows..."

He was booed and whistled by fans at the Stade Velodrome as he went down to the starting ramp, but that will do nothing to dampen the Briton's spirits. For him, there have been ups and downs over the last three weeks. He has faced mechanical issues and he had to fight back after losing his lead. A few days ago he told Sky News that if he won the 2017 Tour de France it would be his greatest achievement to date. On retaining the yellow jersey on Saturday, he said: ""It's an amazing feeling to finish that off now. ""There was a lot of pressure coming into today's stage with it being so close in the general classification, but there was an amazing atmosphere here. ""It's a fitting way to stay in the GC (general classification), which was always going to be a close battle."" Over the last few weeks, Froome has had the backup of all the riders and support staff at Team Sky, with ""domestiques"" working with him as he covered thousands of miles. Their job is to protect him from any attacks by other cyclists and to let him ride in their slip stream so that he doesn't tire so easily. The time trial in Marseille was the penultimate stage of the Tour and Froome finished third, after which British fans called for him to be knighted. Although all the attention is likely to be on him, Team Sky as a whole has come in quicker than any other group of riders in the Tour. There was, however, heartbreak for France. Romain Bardet, who went into Saturday's stage in second place behind Froome, was ill and lost so much time that Froome almost overtook him as they entered the Stade Velodrome. Around the course there was heightened security in Marseille. France is a country on high terror alert, following a number of attacks in recent years, including one at the country's national football stadium in November 2015. The peloton will on Sunday head to Paris for the final stage, which is mainly ceremonial. Froome, who starts the day with a 54-second advantage, will almost certainly be the one making the winner's speech on the Champs Elysees. It will be the fifth time in as many years that the speech has been made to the United Kingdom's national anthem, after Bradley Wiggins triumphed in 2012."

It is the first formal portrait taken of William and Kate's son, who on previous birthdays have often released photographs Kate has taken herself. This one was taken at Kensington Palace at the end of June by Chris Jackson, Getty Images Royal Photographer. In a statement the palace said ""The Duke and Duchess are very pleased to share this lovely picture as they celebrate Prince George's fourth birthday, and would like to thank everyone for all of the kind messages they have received."" It comes at the end of a week-long European tour for William, Kate and their two children. They have visited Poland and Germany over five days on behalf of the foreign office to cement friendships with key EU countries. George had appeared shy and reticent during the European tour, pulling at his father's arm as they faced diplomatic line ups off the plane in Warsaw and Berlin. But he couldn't have been happier when they arrived at Airbus in Hamburg on Friday ahead of flying home. He could not contain his joy when he was taken inside two helicopters on the tarmac, including one like the helicopter Prince William flies for the East Anglian Air Ambulance. At one point Prince George could be seen looking around wide-eyed and clasping his hands to his face in amazement, before then trying on a pilots helmet with the help of his dad. Princess Charlotte however seemed less impressed and threw a tantrum, sitting down next to the helicopter before being coaxed by her mother to get up and walk towards their private plane. In September, Prince George will start at the private school Thomas's Battersea, where fees cost £17,604 a year. The family will also be based at Kensington Palace in London, rather than at their Norfolk mansion Anmer Hall, with William leaving his air ambulance helicopter pilot job this summer to become a full-time royal."

Thousands of abusive messages have been sent to doctors and nurses, and families visiting their children at the hospital have been ""harassed and discomforted"". Charlie's parents have been battling in the courts for permission to take him to America for treatment but Great Ormond Street says this would not help. Mary MacLeod, chairman of the hospital, said in a statement: ""Great Ormond Street Hospital cares for many thousands of seriously unwell children every year, providing outstanding treatment for those who need it most. ""Charlie Gard's case is a heart-breaking one. We fully understand that there is intense public interest, and that emotions run high. ""We recognise the tireless advocacy of Charlie's loving parents and the natural sympathy people feel with his situation. ""However, in recent weeks the GOSH community has been subjected to a shocking and disgraceful tide of hostility and disturbance. Staff have received abuse both in the street and on line. ""Thousands of abusive messages have been sent to doctors and nurses whose life's work is to care for sick children. Many of these messages are menacing, including death threats. ""Families have been harassed and discomforted while visiting their children, and we have received complaints of unacceptable behaviour even within the hospital itself. ""Whatever the strong emotions raised by this case, there can be no excuse for patients and families to have their privacy and peace disturbed as they deal with their own often very stressful situations or for dedicated doctors and nurses to suffer this kind of abuse. ""Great Ormond Street Hospital is in close contact with the Metropolitan Police and we will do everything possible to hold to account anybody who involved in this kind of deplorable behaviour."" The hospital's constituency MP Keir Starmer said the abuse had to stop. He said: ""Great Ormond Street Hospital is one of the world's leading hospitals for children. ""The staff at the hospital work tirelessly and with total dedication. ""Charlie Gard's case is truly tragic and the whole nation sympathises with his parents. It is understandable that people feel very strongly about the case. ""But the abuse of staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital outside the hospital and online is totally unacceptable. There is no place for this abuse and it has to stop."" A judge at the High Court has been hearing evidence about the potential of an experimental treatment that it is claimed could help the baby. The court has previously ruled in favour of the hospital and said 11-month-old Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. Parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard took their case to the European Court of Human Rights but judges refused to intervene. The couple, from Bedfont, west London, say there is new evidence and want Mr Justice Francis to carry out a fresh analysis. American specialist, Michio Hirano, a professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, travelled to London this week to examine Charlie for the first time and discuss the case with Great Ormond Street doctors. He has offered to provide treatment which may improve Charlie's rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. On Friday the court heard that a new MRI scan on Charlie made for ""sad reading"". The court is due to hold a hearing to consider the latest developments on Monday."

2017-07-22,An intensification of protests at fracking sites has led to concerns about rising levels of violence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170723054607/http://news.sky.com/story/rolling-resistance-leads-to-clashes-at-lancashire-fracking-site-10958278,"Both demonstrators and the fracking company Cuadrilla say they are increasingly worried that someone will get seriously hurt or even killed unless the situation improves. Anti-fracking demonstrators have temporarily abandoned their traditional techniques for a month of what they describe as ""rolling resistance"". Its aim is to hold up work at test wells in Lancashire with a range of actions. One protester claims she was knocked unconscious by a security officer employed by Cuadrilla and a man has accused Lancashire police of pushing him out of his wheelchair during a 'lock-on' at one of the sites. Footage shows the man falling out of his chair and ending up on the road before being helped back up. Lancashire police say: ""We are aware of comments and videos circulating on social media following an incident at the fracking site on Preston New Road, near Blackpool, involving a man in a wheelchair. ""The man appeared to be wheeling himself... in between a police vehicle and directly into the path of a lorry that was being escorted to the site. Officers on scene have taken immediate action to keep the man safe... by moving him out of the carriageway. During this intervention he unfortunately fell backwards and came out of his wheelchair."" On behalf of the campaigners, a woman who gave her name as Danni said that protesters were trying to demonstrate peacefully. ""We're not here to cause damage to people, we're here to disrupt Cuadrilla and their operations,"" she said. ""I think a lot of the escalating violence is coming from the police and the security and we've got to do our best to push back against that and say, this is our legal right to protest."" Another campaigner, Katrina Lawrie, told Sky News that she had been knocked unconscious by a security guard while trying to demonstrate peacefully. She said: ""One of the security ran at me and pushed my head into the floor which resulted in me being knocked unconscious. ""We don't raise our hand to anyone. We're always peaceful."" But Francis Egan, the boss of fracking firm Cuadrilla, criticised the protesters, saying they were trying to intimidate workers going about their lawful business. ""We've had 160 arrests in the last six months,"" Mr Egan said. ""We've already had 23 convictions including for carrying a knife, for abuse and for assault, and we have many more cases to come before the magistrates. ""To give the impression that this is peaceful or a lawful protest is frankly ridiculous."" Demonstrators are increasingly resorting to a device known as a ""lock-on"" tube - a piece of iron pipe in which one or two people can lock in their arms. The devices are typically very heavy and make it difficult to remove people attached to them. As I tried to demonstrate a lock-on tube on camera, police intervened to stop filming."

Harry adds that he will probably regret for the rest of his life ""how short that phone call was"". He says the discussion, which will be aired in a programme on ITV on Monday night, was the first time the brothers had ever spoken about Diana ""as a mother"".

Her sons talk at length about her sense of humour, including a moment when she invited supermodels Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell to meet Prince William at Kensington Palace. ""I was probably a 12 or 13-year-old boy who had posters of them on his wall. I went bright red, and didn't know quite what to say,"" he said.

2017-07-22,Gay men will be allowed to donate blood in England three months after having sex under wide-ranging equality reforms by the Government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170723054607/http://news.sky.com/story/rules-on-gay-men-donating-blood-to-be-relaxed-10958261,"Fears over infections led to an outright ban on gay men giving blood at the height of the Aids epidemic, but in 2011 that was changed to allow men to donate blood 12 months after having sex. This will be reduced again in 2018 due to medical advances. The Government also wants to allow transgender people to choose their legal sex without the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Education Secretary Justine Greening said the changes would build on the progress made in tackling prejudice in the 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality. ""This Government is committed to building an inclusive society that works for everyone, no matter what their gender or sexuality, and today we're taking the next step forward,"" she said. ""We will build on the significant progress we have made over the past 50 years, tackling some of the historic prejudices that still persist in our laws and giving LGBT people a real say on the issues affecting them."" The change had been recommended by the advisory committee on the safety of blood, tissues and organs (SaBTO). Reforms to help transgender people choose their legal sex, which include speeding up the bureaucratic process, will go out to consultation in the autumn. Trans people currently have to provide evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to legally change their gender. Suzanna Hopwood, a member of the Stonewall trans advisory group, said: ""Reform is one of the key priorities in our vision for removing the huge inequalities that trans people face in the UK. The current system is demeaning and broken. ""It's vital that this reform removes the requirements for medical evidence and an intrusive interview panel, and finally allows all trans people to have their gender legally recognised through a simple administrative process. ""That's what we'll be calling for during this consultation, and I'm looking forward to seeing the law change soon after."" The announcement of the reforms comes after Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this week indicated she was preparing to reform the Gender Recognition Act."
2017-07-22,Holidaymakers are being warned about the nasty side effects and long-term scarring that can be caused from black henna tattoos.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170723054607/http://news.sky.com/story/pain-and-scarring-warning-over-chemical-filled-black-henna-tattoos-10957085,"James Colley, 18, went to Zante after finishing his exams earlier this month and decided to get one. As a boxing fan, he chose a similar style tattoo to Mike Tyson, who has a distinctive pattern on the left hand side of his face. However, James's became infected and he was rushed to hospital, where doctors told him that he could be left with facial scarring for up to five years. He said the only option was to have the henna bleached off. James told Sky News: ""I went on a lads' holiday. Two days in I saw people getting henna and thought it was a good idea... but it flared up and when I turned up at the hospital she laid me down and told me to relax. ""She bleached the skin and said 'we can stop now if you want'. The pain was really bad, I thought I was going to pass out. ""I would say if you want to get a henna tattoo do your research. Get it done in a proper place with brown henna. It's not worth the risk of getting it bleached off. The pain isn't worth it. It's not."" Traditional brown henna tattoos are usually harmless, but the black ones sometimes contain chemicals, that can react with the skin. Of 288 dermatologists who took part in the Skin Health Alliance 2017 Dermatologist Survey, 72% said they thought the number of incidents where patients had reacted badly to black henna tattoos was increasing year on year. Now there is a warning from the British Skin Foundation. Consultant dermatologist Dr Anjani Mahto said: ""I think the best advice really would be that you're best not getting them, simply because you do not know what is in a lot of these products outside the UK. ""You can't predict who is going to get a reaction and who is not, but if there is any risk of black henna or black henna dye, then its best avoided."" When he returned from his holiday, James tweeted a before and after picture of his tattoo, hoping to warn others about the possible side effects. It has now been shared more than 14,000 times. Farrah Illahi, who is a henna teacher and runs Visible Changes beautician in Cardiff, said: ""Basically people should have a skin test before getting henna. ""With black henna, because there are chemicals in it, you can get a reaction. But with natural or organic henna you can't get an infection so I advise people to get that one."" For James, what started out as a bit of post-exam holiday fun with friends turned into something far more serious. He now wants others to learn from what he's been through."
2017-07-22,"To educate, to inform and entertain is the BBC's motto.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170723054607/http://news.sky.com/story/the-bbc-pay-gap-is-bad-its-class-gap-is-worse-10957166,"Well, after this week we're certainly better educated and informed about the salaries of its top on-screen personalities. Less entertaining, however, were some of the inequalities the list revealed: of the 96 names on the list of the BBC's mega earners, just under a third were women. Moreover the highest-paid woman was paid considerably less than the top male earners. Many absolute stars, like Emily Maitlis and Sarah Montague, failed to make the cut for doing much the same job as their male counterparts. Cue righteous and rightful anger from all sides, even from publications not exactly known as scions of feminism. :: Full list of BBC stars earning more than £150k Likewise many commentators were justly angry at the small number of ethnic minority presenters on the list - a mere 10. But in all the sound and the fury, one clarion call was mysteriously nowhere to be heard: a key piece of the puzzle which, in all of the lamentations over diversity, was time and again too poor to mention: class. Which is curious, because if we actually talked or even cared about this peculiar taboo, we might begin to see one of the reasons the gender and race pay gaps exist in the first place. I've been doing some research and number crunching. The list contains over 80 on-screen names. No fewer than 45% of the BBC's best paid stars went to private schools. That compares to 7% of the nation overall. Just think about that. If you send your child to private school it increases their chances of being one of the biggest names in TV and media by a factor of six. The gender pay gap may be too large but it's not nearly as big as the class pay gap for the people who never made it in the first place because of their background. The injustice is pretty overwhelming: after all, are we really saying that those who are lucky enough to be born into households which can afford to pay for private school fees are six times more talented? Six times better imbued with the skills required to be a successful BBC actor, sports presenter or journalist? And it's in journalism where the problem is most egregious. Three in five of the best-paid BBC on-air journalists and presenters went to independent schools. That means you're nine times more likely to be a top BBC journalist if you went to private school. If you're a working class girl, the odds are longer still. From Jeremy Vine to Mishal Husain from Sophie Raworth to Nick Robinson, the list is eye-wateringly long. Much attention was paid to the pay disparity on the Today programme, less to the fact that four of its five presenters went to private schools. Tellingly, even among many of those who did go to state schools, the vast majority went to grammars. It's possible to count the number of ""bog standard comprehensive"" working class boys and girls on one hand. In the 1810s it was said that the Battle of Waterloo was fought and won on the playing fields of Eton so dominant was the school in the top brass of the Army. In 2017, its equivalent is the six o'clock news. Allow me to declare an interest: I am a comprehensive school boy. I don't belittle for one moment my outstanding colleagues in TV or journalism who went to private school - they are all very talented people. Likewise, I'm a former proud practitioner at the BBC and would defend it to the end of the Earth. And it's quite unfair to single out the BBC in this regard anyway, I'm sure the pattern of private school dominance is repeated across our industry: at Sky, ITV and across Fleet Street. But I desperately want to see more state schoolers from working class backgrounds get into TV and media and I want to see us all try and do more about it. We might start on days like last Wednesday by actually talking about the problem at all. Because class matters in journalism even more than across the other areas covered on that list. We journalists are the ones who day after day, are supposed to reflect Britain unto itself. We're supposed to be the ones who find and tell the stories that matter to our audiences, and for the BBC, all of its licence fee payers. How are we supposed to do that if we are drawn from an increasingly narrow social caste? Maybe, just maybe, if we had more kids in journalism who grew up in tower blocks, we'd have been better at shining a light on the living conditions of some of our fellow citizens, like those who lived and died in Grenfell Tower. Or we would be less disposed to the curse of group think which has led journalists to call it wrong time after time in recent years, whether it be Corbyn, Trump or Brexit. And that's why it matters who is making editorial judgements off screen too. The BBC also published the number of its senior managers who earn more than £150,000 too, to considerably less fanfare. It is again dominated by those sporting the (literally) golden ticket of a private school education: James Purnell the director of radio; James Harding, the director of news; the editors of the flagships Newsnight and Today, Ian Katz and Sarah Sands. Maybe the fact that the top echelons of the media are dominated by private schoolers explains some of the gender and BAME pay gaps. If you go to private school you're more likely to hire other people like you, other private schoolers, who are less likely to be from an ethnic minority background. Open the talent pool up to more talented, ambitious state school educated girls and they might look a lot more kindly on the pay of their female on-screen colleagues vis-a-vis their male counterparts. It's no secret that it's hard to get into journalism and the media. Unpaid internships and an expensive postgraduate degree from City university (£9,000 a year) are almost as obligatory as passports at the border these days. Not to mention the fact that virtually all opportunities are concentrated in London. None of this is the fault of any of the people on that list nor any one person in management of any organisation. But I do think, frankly, that many senior BBC managers and others from across the media's boss class generally care about class diversity much less because it's less tangible than sex or race. Easier to point to new women or BAME hires, less easy and less headline grabbing to talk about class, which is, after all a more fluid concept yet connected intrinsically to both. But just because it's harder and less 'zeitgeisty' doesn't mean it's not important and we should start to recognise that diversity in our society is more than just about your sex or gender. It's a complicated, tightly woven tapestry and your background and class, for which your educational background is a pretty decent indicator, is crucial. Is a poor working class man from Scunthorpe less diverse than a wealthy ethnic minority woman from Hampstead who went to one of the country's top private schools? I think they both have something to say and we need as many different voices as we can in the makeup of our media. As welcome as it would be, the injustice of inequality won't be righted simply by having equal numbers of men and women on screen even if they're on the same pay. The work will only have just begun. Diversity is about more than what you can see."

Users will soon have to pass a safety awareness test as part of the process of registering a drone, which may be enabled by an app-based system. Forty eight near-misses between planes and unmanned aerial vehicles have been reported in the first half of this year alone, and pilots have warned that the situation is potentially ""catastrophic"". Flights had to be diverted at Gatwick earlier this month when a drone was spotted on a flight path, while in June a pilot in Edinburgh had to take swift action when a drone passed just 20 metres from his aircraft ""Readily-available drones which can be flown by anyone can shatter or go straight through an aircraft windshield or shatter a helicopter rotor,"" said Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the pilots' union BALPA.

It is also exploring the option of geo-fencing, which prevents drones from entering restricted areas such as airfields or prisons. Last year police recorded 3,456 incidents involving drones, a figure than 12 times the number logged in 2014. The gadgets had been used in ""scoping exercises"" and snooping operations, the reports showed, as well as being implicated in rows between neighbours, prison smuggling and burglary.

She described the failure to find Mr McKeague during the ""unprecedented"" search of the more than 48-hectare landfill site as ""bitterly disappointing"". Det. Supt. Elliott said: ""Without anything further to tell us where he might be on such a vast site the search cannot continue. ""Officers have been finding items such as newspapers and other material that have September 2016 dates on them. This is the time that Corrie went missing. ""Some items have been clearly identifiable as coming from Bury St Edmunds and this has confirmed that we have been searching in the right place, however none of these items have had any link to Corrie."" She added: ""Having been through all of the possibilities in detail, there is nothing to support any theory other than that Corrie was in the bin. ""There are no further sightings of him on CCTV to suggest he left the area, and we have explored the other possibilities as to how he left - such as being taken from the area by someone - and there is no evidence to support that this is the case."" Police discovered the weight of the bin pick-up in Bury St Edmunds on the night Mr McKeague disappeared was much higher than originally thought - at more than 100kg (15st 10lb) compared to the 11kg (1st 10lb) they were first told. Officers working on the search had to be given hydration tablets to combat the risk of heat exhaustion amid summer temperatures. Expertise gathered during the search of the site has been passed onto other police forces, Det. Supt. Elliott said. She added: ""We have been absolutely committed to finding Corrie and none of us wanted to be in this position, where we are unable to provide the answer."" The investigation has cost more than £1.2m to date, with the vast majority of the money spent on rifling through the landfill. Suffolk Police said they remain ""open minded"" and will ""vigorously"" pursue further lines of enquiry should they appear. Mr McKeague's girlfriend April Oliver announced last month the vanished serviceman had become a father with the birth of their daughter. He is stationed at RAF Honington in Suffolk."
2017-07-22,David Davis has come top in a survey asking Tory members who they would favour as a candidate to replace Theresa May.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170723054607/http://news.sky.com/story/poll-reveals-tory-members-favour-david-davis-if-theresa-may-is-ousted-10958296,"The Brexit Secretary was favoured by 21% of respondents in the survey, with his nearest rival Boris Johnson on 17%. But plans to oust the Conservatives' beleaguered leader would be unlikely to command widespread support, it appears. Although 22% of those surveyed said they wanted Mrs May to quit, the vast majority - 71% - said they did not want her to leave her post. The data reflects indications from senior members of the 1922 Committee, representing Conservative backbenchers, which have suggested there is little appetite for a new leader. The survey, carried out by the Economic and Social Research Council and obtained by The Observer, follows weeks of speculation about how long the minority Government will last. The result of June's snap General Election, which saw the Conservatives lose a solid majority, prompted fury toward Mrs May and suggestions she should step down. And last week multiple leaks against Philip Hammond exposed huge fissures in Mrs May's Cabinet. She was forced to warn that party divisions could open the door to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn stepping into Number 10. The latest poll indicates there is still uncertainty among Conservatives, as 26% said they did not know, or did not wish to disclose, their preferred candidate for a future replacement. The third choice for a potential leader among those surveyed was Jacob Rees-Mogg, a backbencher on the right wing of the party. Some 6% of respondents said they thought he would make the best leader. Mrs May is set to leave on Monday for a holiday in the Swiss Alps, which she has previously described as a destination where ""the air is clear and you can get some peace and quiet"". Meanwhile, Mr Davis and his team were mocked on Saturday after it emerged they were being chauffeured in a Spanish-made car while negotiating Britain's exit from the European Union. The vehicle is one of two available to ministers in the Department for Exiting the EU."
2017-07-22,Donald Trump appears to have confirmed this week's rumours that he has sought advice on the extent of the Commander-in-Chief's power to pardon.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170723054607/http://news.sky.com/story/could-president-donald-trump-pardon-himself-10958020,"The President's Saturday morning Twitter storm included this: ""While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS."" It was perhaps the most fascinating snippet of all in the now-regular weekend torrent of defensiveness and accusation. It had been reported that Trump had enquired of the White House lawyers, a busy bunch they must be, on the rules for granting presidential pardons to aides or even himself. While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS So was it entirely apropos of nothing that Trump decided to ponder the whole matter on Twitter? Raising the issue does kind of suggest there might be something they need pardoning FOR down the line. What sort of prosecutions is the President foreseeing? The question of whether the President can in fact 'self-pardon' is such a tortured and twisted test of logic and law, one that the country last pondered in the Watergate days of Richard Nixon. It involves discussions like this: If a president needs to pardon himself, should he not have already resigned for whatever offence he has committed? Or does he grant the pardon on his way out of office? Remember Trump is the president who fired the FBI director who was investigating him, has publicly lambasted the intelligence and legal communities, and alleged that Barack Obama spied on him. Does anyone think that, if he could, Trump would not attempt to pardon himself? The White House has done little to dampen the speculation that Trump might remove the special counsel Robert Mueller, the widely respected former FBI director now leading the Russia investigation. Trump is frustrated and furious that the allegations of collusion, the ones he labels a ""hoax"", continue to dog his administration and keep the focus off his legislative agenda. Talk to people who voted for him and they agree that this is all a media-driven hoo-hah. It is why he loves the direct line that Twitter gives him to his public. But at some point all of these investigations, the special counsel and numerous congressional committees, will come to a head and, guilty or not guilty, a day of legal reckoning will arrive for the President and those around him. His research on the pardon this week might come in handy. That he sent that tweet on the very day he visited a new warship named after Gerald Ford, the president who did in fact grant a pardon to Nixon, is just one of those delicious little Trump-era side dishes. Ford's reputation never really recovered from that decision. Pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey is so much more straightforward."

The 27-year-old was ordered to pay £7,800 in compensation and £650 in court costs. Gascoigne claimed he was left with a fractured skull and two broken fingers after being ""kicked down the stairs"" during the incident at the Ace Hotel in Shoreditch. Following the sentencing at Stratford Magistrates' Court on Friday, Detective Constable Lee Jackson said: ""The victim required hospital treatment after he was knocked down some stairs at the hotel by Beard. ""Despite initially denying the assault, he had no option but to plead guilty. ""The custodial sentence passed on by the courts shows that violent behaviour will not be tolerated.""

Boots had faced criticism after refusing to reduce the cost of the emergency contraceptive, saying making it cheaper may mean it is ""misused or overused"". Labour MPs had attacked the company for taking an ""unacceptable"" moral position and health campaigners claimed women were being hit with a ""sexist surcharge"". A spokesman for the chain said: ""Pharmacy and care for customers are at the heart of everything we do and as such we are truly sorry that our poor choice of words in describing our position on emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) has caused offence and misunderstanding, and we sincerely apologise."" Boots charges £28.25 for Levonelle emergency contraceptive and £26.75 for its own version, while Tesco charges £13.50 for Levonelle and Superdrug £13.49 for a generic product. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which launched the campaign calling on Boots to reduce the price of the emergency contraceptive, found the progestogen-based pills can cost up to five times more in the UK than other parts of Europe. Boots said its price tag was based on the cost of the medicine and the consultation the pharmacist carries out with women but it is ""committed"" to finding less expensive versions of the tablet. It said: ""We firmly believe in the right of all women to access the EHC service with ease and convenience, and have long been at the forefront of increasing accessibility of contraception for women. ""The provision of EHC requires a regulated mandatory consultation to protect women's health and is a professional healthcare service provided by highly trained pharmacists. As a leading pharmacy, we will not compromise or undervalue this professional service."" BPAS told Sky News it was ""delighted"" with the change of policy, but urged Boots to implement pricing changes quickly to bring it in line with other retailers. Katherine O'Brien, head of media and policy research at BPAS, said: ""We are delighted with Boots' decision to lower the price. It is obviously welcomed. ""I hope that they enact this policy soon because we've already seen Superdrug and Tesco lower their prices over the last two months. ""There is no reason why Boots can't do the same in a short time period."""
2017-07-22,The British payments start-up TransferWise has kicked off talks about a new fundraising that will see its valuation soar past £1bn for the first time.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170723054607/http://news.sky.com/story/transferwise-to-smash-through-1bn-barrier-as-founder-eyes-float-10957478,"Sky News has learnt that TransferWise is in detailed talks with investors, including several prospective new backers, about a funding round that could double the $117m (£90m) it has already raised during its six-year history. ‎Sources said this weekend that the payments company, which now sees more than £1bn transferred using its app each month, could finalise its new funding within a matter of weeks. TransferWise is understood to be targeting more than $100m (£77m) of new capital, with its valuation‎ including the additional funds reaching about $1.5bn (£1.15bn). If completed, it would represent a big vote of confidence in one of the UK's most prominent financial technology - or fintech - businesses at a time when the funding of such companies is being closely watched to discern international investors' views about Brexit. It would also come amid a frenzy of deals in the global payments industry as new technology drives down costs and improves speed and efficiency for customers. In recent weeks, Worldpay has agreed a £7.4bn sale to Vantiv of the US, while Paysafe, another London-listed company, struck a deal on Friday to be bought by Blackstone and CVC Capital Partners, the buyout firms. TransferWise provides exchange rates to users which are more competitive than most traditional competitors by using an element of peer-to-peer funding to cut costs. Instead of actually converting money, it pairs users wanting to buy a currency with those wanting to sell it, enabling them to save on often-costly fees. TransferWise is used by more than one million people to move money internationally, ‎which it claims saves them more than £1.5m each day. It is now profitable on an annualised basis - an important milestone for any tech start-up. The company boasts a 10% market share in the UK, and expects to‎ reach $100m (£77m) in revenue this year. TransferWise's existing investors include some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley, including Andreessen Horowitz, one of the early backers of Facebook. Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, is also a shareholder. The company last raised money in May 2016, when the Edinburgh-based fund manager Baillie Gifford led a $26m funding round. Since then, Andreessen Horowitz has increased its stake in the company by acquiring shares held by TransferWise's initial 'angel' investors. Founded by a pair of Estonian former Skype employees, they announced this month that they were swa‎pping roles, with Taavet Hinrikus becoming chairman and Kristo Kaarmann taking over as chief executive. In a blog-post explaining the move, Mr Hinrikus said he and his co-founder decided to set it up ""because of our own frustration - banks were overcharging and under-serving for a simple service, and lying about it"". He also raised the prospect of following the route pursued by companies such as Facebook and Snap Inc, adding: ""What was an idea seven years ago is now a company that will do $100m in annual revenue. Next up $1bn in revenue? ""In a few years it will be time to think seriously about becoming a public company like the strongest and most trusted financial institutions are. ‎""But when we do that we will explore that through our own lens - how will it help our customers? How will it help us achieve our mission faster?"" TransferWise's expansion has seen it launch into markets including China and Sri Lanka, while it has also signed a partnership with Number26, a start-up which enables users to open a bank account within eight minutes. Its growth has not, however, been untroubled. The company was fined by US authorities for operating without the correct licence, and it was forced to modify its advertising claims in the UK. Nevertheless, it is one of relatively few British technology companies to have achieved so-called unicorn status, meaning it is valued at more than $1bn (£800m). The latest fundraising comes amid efforts by rival European start-up hubs such as Berlin to poach business from the UK amid uncertainty about visa restrictions in the wake of the Brexit vote. A TransferWise spokeswoman declined to comment on the talks with investors."
2017-07-22,"Camden Council has insisted it is safe for residents to return to their flats in the Chalcots Estate, after four weeks of urgent safety works. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170723054607/http://news.sky.com/story/camden-tower-block-residents-fear-for-safety-of-tower-block-homes-10957081,"Hundred of households were relocated to hotel rooms after four tower blocks failed fire safety tests following the Grenfell Tower fire. Inspection teams found multiple fire safety failures within the buildings, as well as identifying problems with the external cladding, which failed combustibility tests. The council has now said it is safe to return to the building, but many residents are unhappy with the quality of the work. Steve Pirolli and his family have lived on the fourth floor of Taplow Tower for 17 years. He showed us some of the work carried out inside, including new sealant around fire doors, extra fire exit signs and expandable foam around gas pipes. ""To be honest the work they've done is just shoddy, it's really, really shoddy and I've spoke to people in the building trade that renovate houses into student flats and they have to have everything has to be exactly right, and they say the work is just Mickey Mouse,"" Steve explained. Another resident, 72-year-old Shirley Phillips, who featured on Sky News the night the towers were evacuated, is also unhappy. She and her dog Tilly spent the night outside after being told to leave her flat. But four weeks in a hotel room have caused Shirley immense stress. ""It's been awful"" she said tearfully. ""I get up with a headache and it just doesn't go away, even taking tablets."" Like other residents, Shirley doesn't think the work is good enough. ""They reckon it's going to take another six weeks to get the fire doors and possibly another nine months before the cladding's removed, so how is that safe?"" she said. Some residents are reportedly refusing to return until the council provides independent assurance the blocks are safe. They are advising other unhappy tenants to contact local solicitors. In a statement the Leader of Camden Council, Georgia Gould, said: ""We will go over and above these works to enhance safety measures, but the London Fire Brigade have informed us that they are content that sufficient progress has been made to allow a phased return home for residents. ""We'll continue to work relentlessly, floor by floor, until the works the fire brigade have specified are complete."" It's still unclear when the cladding will be removed. Across England, 263 residential buildings failed combustibility tests. The work to replace or remove cladding will take months. As people return to their homes in Camden, many are still questioning how safe they are living in tower blocks."

In total 2.45 million flights soared through UK skies in 2016. Jamie Hutchison, the director of the National Air Traffic Service (NATS) control base in Swanwick, warned the ""ageing design of UK airspace"" has brought the UK to the limit of its capacity for flights. Mr Hutchison said that today's expected record has not surprised air traffic controllers, who start planning for flights more than a year in advance. ""We work very closely with our airline and airport customers in the run-up to the summer to ensure we have the right planning and resources in place to get people away safely for a well-earned holiday,"" he said. ""It's our busiest time of year and traffic growth is outpacing forecasts year-on-year. ""In the last few weeks we have already safely managed record-breaking daily traffic levels, but the ageing design of UK airspace means we will soon reach the limits of what can be managed without delays rising significantly."" He told Sky News the UK's airspace ""was never designed to accommodate the levels of traffic we're seeing today"". As the skies get more crowded, the Government launched its planned aviation strategy to deal with the next 30 years and beyond. The public is being asked their views on doorstep luggage collection services and town centre check-in desks for passengers flying from British airports. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""As a global, trading nation we want to build on the great industry we have today and create opportunities for people up and down the country. ""Our new aviation strategy will look beyond the new runway at Heathrow and sets out a comprehensive long-term plan for UK aviation. It will support jobs and economic growth across the whole of the UK."" As part of the strategy, a £1bn investment to double the size of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 was announced. Charlie Cornish, the chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, described the investment as a ""significant moment"" demonstrating ""the confidence that we have in the long-term future of both the North and the UK economy"". Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Today's warning from NATS is yet another example of the Government's failure to act and comes as uncertainty over Brexit is threatening the UK aviation industry. ""The Government must listen to what NATS and the industry more broadly are warning and take action to protect and modernise UK airspace."""

GOSH, which says Charlie's life support treatment should stop, revealed on Saturday that it had contacted police following death threats and a ""shocking and disgraceful tide"" of hostility and disturbance at the London medical facility. Charlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, said they faced a ""backlash"" after the revelation, adding that they ""do not and have not ever condoned any threatening or abusive remarks"" towards GOSH staff. Ms Yates said: ""Despite conflicting issues, we have always had the utmost respect for all the staff who work tirelessly at Great Ormond Street Hospital and the very difficult jobs they do every day. ""Like them we have been shocked by some of the public response to this case and agree with them that it is disgraceful that doctors have received death threats."" Charlie, who is 11 months old, suffers from a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. He also has brain damage.

He told NME magazine in June he wanted to look at ways to reduce, ameliorate, lengthen the repayment period or ""some other means of reducing that debt burden"". He added: ""I don't see why those that had the historical misfortune to be at university during the £9,000 period should be burdened excessively compared to those that went before or those that come after. ""I will deal with it."" This week Mr Corbyn was accused by senior Tory Iain Duncan Smith of using students as ""electoral fodder"" by indicating he would wipe out their debt. But the Labour leader said his remarks had not represented a ""commitment"" to erase student debt and admitted the party had not known at the time how much such a move would cost. Mr Corbyn said he would be making a statement on the issue soon. He told BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I did not make a commitment we would write it off because I couldn't at that stage. ""I pointed out we had written the manifesto in a short space of time because there was a surprise election but that we would look at ways of reducing that debt burden, recognising that a lot of it is never going to be collected anyway and try and reduce that burden."" He added: ""We never said we would completely abolish it because we were unaware of the size of it at the time.""

But responding to the letter, a BBC spokesperson said: ""We have made significant changes over the last three years but need to do more. Tony Hall has pledged the BBC will go further faster. ""Across the BBC, the average pay of men is 10% higher than women. The national average is 18%. ""We are committing to closing it by 2020 - something no other organisation has committed to doing.

""If I'd known now obviously what was going to happen I wouldn't have been so blase about it,"" he says. Harry adds that he will probably regret for the rest of his life ""how short that phone call was"". He says the discussion, which will be aired in a programme on ITV on Monday night, was the first time the brothers had ever spoken about Diana ""as a mother"". ""Arguably, probably a little bit too raw up until this point,"" Harry says. ""It's still raw."" Prince William describes sharing memories of his mother as ""cathartic"" and ""quite a healing process"". ""There's not many days that go by that I don't think of her,"" he says. ""Her 20th anniversary year seems a good time to remember good things about her and maybe provide a different side to her people haven't seen before.""

The force said that after entering a shop he was seen ""trying to swallow an object"" - and was then taken ill. Mr Charles, 20, died in hospital around an hour later. A vigil has been planned for 6pm on Monday outside Stoke Newington police station. The organisers, Hackney Stand Up to Racism and Fascism, wrote on Facebook that Mr Charles' death had left them ""enormously concerned and angered"".

Footage apparently showing the incident leading to Mr Charles' death has been posted on social media with the hashtag #JusticeForRash. Chief Superintendent Simon Laurence, borough commander for Hackney, urged people to keep up-to-date with information from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and expressed concern over ""speculation"" regarding the cause of death. Mr Laurence said: ""The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an independent investigation to establish what happened and has viewed the officers' body worn video. ""There is likely to be speculation over the next few days regarding what led to this man becoming ill, so I would encourage people to keep up-to-date with the IPCC's statements, as and when they are released.

Education Secretary Justine Greening, who is also equalities minister, said he wanted to remove the stigma faced by transpeople, who have to produce evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to legally change their gender. She told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that the Government had made ""huge progress"" on LGBT rights in the 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality, but there was more to be done. ""At the moment if you want to change your gender it's a very complicated process, it's quite intrusive as well and it's very bound up in going to see your GP and a whole medical process that then gets kicked off,"" Ms Greening said. ""What we want to do is try and streamline the process, make it easier, demedicalise it and make it less intrusive and we'll be consulting on how to do that in the autumn."" Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this week indicated she was prepared to reform the Gender Recognition Act, saying there was ""still a long way to go"" on rights and protections for transpeople. Suzanna Hopwood, a member of the Stonewall trans advisory group, said: ""Reform is one of the key priorities in our vision for removing the huge inequalities that trans people face in the UK. The current system is demeaning and broken. ""It's vital that this reform removes the requirements for medical evidence and an intrusive interview panel, and finally allows all trans people to have their gender legally recognised through a simple administrative process. ""That's what we'll be calling for during this consultation, and I'm looking forward to seeing the law change soon after.""

Fears over infections led to an outright ban on gay men giving blood at the height of the Aids epidemic, but in 2011 that was changed to allow men to donate blood 12 months after having sex. This will be reduced again in 2018 due to medical advances."

Shots were heard from the affected wing until around midnight and the prison is now fully under the control of authorities. A small number of prisoners reportedly attempted to damage the wing of the prison after refusing to follow the orders of prison officers in charge. A Prison Service spokesperson said the unrest posed no danger to the public and that the offenders involved would be ""punished"" with ""extra time behind bars"". The incident comes little more than a week after the acting head of the Prison Officers' Association warned that levels of violence in prisons were ""absolutely horrendous"".

Chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said the jail had levels of violence that were ""far too high"" and faced serious issues with ""safety and respect"". Inspectors to the prison had also found increased levels of self-harm and reported that a quarter of prisoners ""felt unsafe"" in the jail."

The latest addition to the White House team has admitted deleting tweets from before his appointment - some of which were at odds with Mr Trump's positions. One tweet praised the woman Mr Trump beat to the White House, Hillary Clinton - but Mr Scaramucci said it was ""a total distraction"" to focus on views he had previously expressed. ""When I made the decision to take this job, my politics and my political ideas do not matter at all,"" he said.

2017-07-23,"Three miles off Spain's Costa Blanca, Vicente Sana and his crew pull in their first catch of the day, but as the nets are opened onto the deck, plastic and rubbish tumbles out with the fish.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170724063510/http://news.sky.com/story/sky-ocean-rescue-spanish-fishermen-find-new-way-to-clear-oceans-of-plastic-10959255,"Fisherman Paco Perez points out a bit of old tyre, a diver's fin, water bottles and yoghurt pots. He tells me this is normal, that they're seeing more plastic in the Mediterranean now than in the past. ""Why?"" I ask. ""I don't know,"" he replies. ""I guess people are throwing away more, but we notice it more in the summer."" A recent survey by Greenpeace found 96% of litter floating on the surface of the Mediterranean was plastic. Globally, it is estimated that as much as 12.7 million metric tonnes of plastic enters the ocean each year. Vicente and his crew, along with about 2,000 fishermen in Spain, are now working with clothing company Ecoalf to turn plastic found in the sea into fabric. ""We make our living from the sea so we have to clean it up,"" he explains. ""Everything we catch, instead of throwing it back, which would be easy, we just separate into bags and in the afternoon we deposit them in the container."" Environmentally, working on a trawler causes controversy, so some of them see the project as doing their bit. The rubbish that is collected onboard is thrown into bright yellow bins in the port. The plastic is then separated and taken by Ecoalf to be broken into chips and then pellets, which can eventually be spun into thread. The end results include jackets, trainers and backpacks - all made from recycled plastic. At the company's store in Madrid, founder Javier Goyeneche explains how his dismay at the amount of waste produced by the fashion world made him want to make a clothing line that was more sustainable. So far they have transformed 30 million used bottles into material but Mr Goyaneche says the pollution is widespread: ""We did a trial test with a thousand divers (in Thailand) in January and we took 7.5 tonnes of waste in one day out of the ocean, 7.5 kilos per diver. ""It's not a problem of Spain or of Thailand, it's the same problem in Mexico, Columbia, in Hawaii. This is a worldwide problem."" Of course, it is not just fish swimming with plastic. Thousands of holidaymakers pack onto the popular beaches of the Costa Blanca. The fishermen told me tourism had increased the pollution in the sea. The fishermen's livelihoods depend on cleaning up the water. The pollution is killing off their product. In Vicente's words: ""No fish means no work."" The rest of us won't go untouched; the plastic that is filling up our seas will eventually end up on our plates. Sky News launched its Sky Ocean Rescue campaign earlier this year aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the world's seas. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"

Anti-fracking demonstrators have temporarily abandoned their traditional techniques for a month of what they describe as ""rolling resistance"". Its aim is to hold up work at test wells in Lancashire with a range of actions. One protester claims she was knocked unconscious by a security officer employed by Cuadrilla and a man has accused Lancashire police of pushing him out of his wheelchair during a 'lock-on' at one of the sites. Footage shows the man falling out of his chair and ending up on the road before being helped back up. Lancashire police say: ""We are aware of comments and videos circulating on social media following an incident at the fracking site on Preston New Road, near Blackpool, involving a man in a wheelchair. ""The man appeared to be wheeling himself... in between a police vehicle and directly into the path of a lorry that was being escorted to the site. Officers on scene have taken immediate action to keep the man safe... by moving him out of the carriageway. During this intervention he unfortunately fell backwards and came out of his wheelchair."" On behalf of the campaigners, a woman who gave her name as Danni said that protesters were trying to demonstrate peacefully. ""We're not here to cause damage to people, we're here to disrupt Cuadrilla and their operations,"" she said. ""I think a lot of the escalating violence is coming from the police and the security and we've got to do our best to push back against that and say, this is our legal right to protest."" Another campaigner, Katrina Lawrie, told Sky News that she had been knocked unconscious by a security guard while trying to demonstrate peacefully. She said: ""One of the security ran at me and pushed my head into the floor which resulted in me being knocked unconscious. ""We don't raise our hand to anyone. We're always peaceful."" But Francis Egan, the boss of fracking firm Cuadrilla, criticised the protesters, saying they were trying to intimidate workers going about their lawful business. ""We've had 160 arrests in the last six months,"" Mr Egan said. ""We've already had 23 convictions including for carrying a knife, for abuse and for assault, and we have many more cases to come before the magistrates. ""To give the impression that this is peaceful or a lawful protest is frankly ridiculous."" Demonstrators are increasingly resorting to a device known as a ""lock-on"" tube - a piece of iron pipe in which one or two people can lock in their arms. The devices are typically very heavy and make it difficult to remove people attached to them. As I tried to demonstrate a lock-on tube on camera, police intervened to stop filming."

Asked if he had held discussions with Labour MPs over stopping or changing Brexit, he told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""Yes and Conservative MPs too ... indeed, yes, members of the shadow Cabinet and Conservatives, mainly backbenchers."" Sir Vince said Labour MPs were being ""intimidated"" and told to ""toe the line or else"". He added: ""A lot of Conservatives and perhaps even more the business people who are deeply, deeply unhappy and I suspect before long a lot of the Conservatives who see this ending in disaster are going to resurface and I want to talk to them. ""It's not a narrow party issue this, there is a very broad movement now beginning to coalesce in the centre of British politics."" Sir Vince said he thought there was an appetite for retaining elements of the EU that are ""good for Britain"", such as membership of the single market and customs union, both of which Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to pull Britain out of. ""I want to work with people in other parties to make sure those are safeguarded and they are not jettisoned,"" he said. The centrepiece of the Lib Dems' policy on Europe is offering voters an ""exit from Brexit"" through another referendum once negotiations have finished, with staying in the EU an option on the ballot paper. Sir Vince insisted such a vote would not be a re-run of the 2016 race, and public opinion will change once the ""sheer complexity"" and ""horrors"" of leaving the EU become apparent. ""If that happens people will be looking for what I call an exit from Brexit and in that context a second referendum becomes relevant."" Sir Vince added: ""In the immediate future that is the objective (altering the Government's Brexit approach) but at the end of the process there is a separate issue which is are we happy with the outcome, do we want to jump over the cliff and hope for the best or do we want to go back to European Union? And that will be an issue then in maybe two years' time."" At 74, Sir Vince is the oldest leader in his party's history - and he rejected suggestions he is too old for the job. ""Age shouldn't be an issue if you have got the motivation and the energy and the stamina and you keep fit, which is what I do,"" he said."

Trains across the company's entire network were delayed by up to 90 minutes, while other services were subject to last-minute cancellations. The disruption began when all signalling was lost in the Earlsfield area, leaving SWT unable to run trains into Waterloo. A Network Rail spokesman said: ""We're sorry for the disruption this will cause to people's journeys this morning, and will continue to work to resume a normal service as quickly as possible."" SWT passengers were already facing delays this morning because of a track defect on a set of points between Woking and Surbiton - blocking the London-bound fast line. The disruption comes days before the start of major work at Waterloo to extend platforms, which is set to cause three weeks of delays at the transport hub. Stagecoach has lost the franchise to run SWT, with a consortium of First Group and Hong Kong-based MTR taking over next month. The RMT union has warned that vital services have been left on a knife edge following a series of cuts to railway budgets. General secretary Mick Cash said: ""The state of transport services right across London this morning serves is the clearest possible warning to this Government that their policy of hacking back the budgets of both Network Rail and Transport for London is dragging Tube and rail in the capital city into permanent chaos."""

""I think we would want to get it out of the way before the election, I don't think people would want to have it dragging on."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said the Cabinet was ""united"" around a transitional deal to allow continued access to migrant labour and provide certainty for businesses. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of ""parroting lies"" after he said the UK must quit the single market because it is leaving the EU. Mr Corbyn said he did not yet have a clear position on whether Britain should stay in the customs union, but the UK cannot remain a part of the single market as it is ""inextricably linked"" with EU membership. But one of his own MPs, Chuka Umunna, pointed out there are a number of countries outside the EU that are part of the trading area. Mr Umunna, who led a rebellion against the party leadership over its stance on the single market, said most Labour Party members wanted Britain to stay in it. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have accused Mr Corbyn of repeating lies used by Brexiteers - and claimed Labour MPs are being ""intimidated"" into following the party line on Europe. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable told Sky News he had been in talks with members of the shadow cabinet and Conservative backbenchers over the fight against Brexit and said Labour MPs were being ""intimidated"" and told to ""toe the line or else"". The party's Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""Jeremy Corbyn's failure to stand up for the single market is a betrayal of future generations who will suffer most from an extreme Brexit. ""He is parroting the lie used by leading Brexiteers that membership of the single market is the same as staying in the EU."""
2017-07-23,"To educate, to inform and entertain is the BBC's motto.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170724063510/http://news.sky.com/story/the-bbc-pay-gap-is-bad-its-class-gap-is-worse-10957166,"Well, after this week we're certainly better educated and informed about the salaries of its top on-screen personalities. Less entertaining, however, were some of the inequalities the list revealed: of the 96 names on the list of the BBC's mega earners, just under a third were women. Moreover the highest-paid woman was paid considerably less than the top male earners. Many absolute stars, like Emily Maitlis and Sarah Montague, failed to make the cut for doing much the same job as their male counterparts. Cue righteous and rightful anger from all sides, even from publications not exactly known as scions of feminism. :: Full list of BBC stars earning more than £150k Likewise many commentators were justly angry at the small number of ethnic minority presenters on the list - a mere 10. But in all the sound and the fury, one clarion call was mysteriously nowhere to be heard: a key piece of the puzzle which, in all of the lamentations over diversity, was time and again too poor to mention: class. Which is curious, because if we actually talked or even cared about this peculiar taboo, we might begin to see one of the reasons the gender and race pay gaps exist in the first place. I've been doing some research and number crunching. The list contains over 80 on-screen names. No fewer than 45% of the BBC's best paid stars went to private schools. That compares to 7% of the nation overall. Just think about that. If you send your child to private school it increases their chances of being one of the biggest names in TV and media by a factor of six. The gender pay gap may be too large but it's not nearly as big as the class pay gap for the people who never made it in the first place because of their background. The injustice is pretty overwhelming: after all, are we really saying that those who are lucky enough to be born into households which can afford to pay for private school fees are six times more talented? Six times better imbued with the skills required to be a successful BBC actor, sports presenter or journalist? And it's in journalism where the problem is most egregious. Three in five of the best-paid BBC on-air journalists and presenters went to independent schools. That means you're nine times more likely to be a top BBC journalist if you went to private school. If you're a working class girl, the odds are longer still. From Jeremy Vine to Mishal Husain from Sophie Raworth to Nick Robinson, the list is eye-wateringly long. Much attention was paid to the pay disparity on the Today programme, less to the fact that four of its five presenters went to private schools. Tellingly, even among many of those who did go to state schools, the vast majority went to grammars. It's possible to count the number of ""bog standard comprehensive"" working class boys and girls on one hand. In the 1810s it was said that the Battle of Waterloo was fought and won on the playing fields of Eton so dominant was the school in the top brass of the Army. In 2017, its equivalent is the six o'clock news. Allow me to declare an interest: I am a comprehensive school boy. I don't belittle for one moment my outstanding colleagues in TV or journalism who went to private school - they are all very talented people. Likewise, I'm a former proud practitioner at the BBC and would defend it to the end of the Earth. And it's quite unfair to single out the BBC in this regard anyway, I'm sure the pattern of private school dominance is repeated across our industry: at Sky, ITV and across Fleet Street. But I desperately want to see more state schoolers from working class backgrounds get into TV and media and I want to see us all try and do more about it. We might start on days like last Wednesday by actually talking about the problem at all. Because class matters in journalism even more than across the other areas covered on that list. We journalists are the ones who day after day, are supposed to reflect Britain unto itself. We're supposed to be the ones who find and tell the stories that matter to our audiences, and for the BBC, all of its licence fee payers. How are we supposed to do that if we are drawn from an increasingly narrow social caste? Maybe, just maybe, if we had more kids in journalism who grew up in tower blocks, we'd have been better at shining a light on the living conditions of some of our fellow citizens, like those who lived and died in Grenfell Tower. Or we would be less disposed to the curse of group think which has led journalists to call it wrong time after time in recent years, whether it be Corbyn, Trump or Brexit. And that's why it matters who is making editorial judgements off screen too. The BBC also published the number of its senior managers who earn more than £150,000 too, to considerably less fanfare. It is again dominated by those sporting the (literally) golden ticket of a private school education: James Purnell the director of radio; James Harding, the director of news; the editors of the flagships Newsnight and Today, Ian Katz and Sarah Sands. Maybe the fact that the top echelons of the media are dominated by private schoolers explains some of the gender and BAME pay gaps. If you go to private school you're more likely to hire other people like you, other private schoolers, who are less likely to be from an ethnic minority background. Open the talent pool up to more talented, ambitious state school educated girls and they might look a lot more kindly on the pay of their female on-screen colleagues vis-a-vis their male counterparts. It's no secret that it's hard to get into journalism and the media. Unpaid internships and an expensive postgraduate degree from City university (£9,000 a year) are almost as obligatory as passports at the border these days. Not to mention the fact that virtually all opportunities are concentrated in London. None of this is the fault of any of the people on that list nor any one person in management of any organisation. But I do think, frankly, that many senior BBC managers and others from across the media's boss class generally care about class diversity much less because it's less tangible than sex or race. Easier to point to new women or BAME hires, less easy and less headline grabbing to talk about class, which is, after all a more fluid concept yet connected intrinsically to both. But just because it's harder and less 'zeitgeisty' doesn't mean it's not important and we should start to recognise that diversity in our society is more than just about your sex or gender. It's a complicated, tightly woven tapestry and your background and class, for which your educational background is a pretty decent indicator, is crucial. Is a poor working class man from Scunthorpe less diverse than a wealthy ethnic minority woman from Hampstead who went to one of the country's top private schools? I think they both have something to say and we need as many different voices as we can in the makeup of our media. As welcome as it would be, the injustice of inequality won't be righted simply by having equal numbers of men and women on screen even if they're on the same pay. The work will only have just begun. Diversity is about more than what you can see."

The IMF's prediction that the global economy will grow by 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 remains unchanged, driven largely by China, Japan and the EU. The Treasury said the report showed why securing the ""very best deal"" on Brexit with the European Union was ""vitally important"". But it insisted ""the fundamentals of our economy are strong"". A spokesman said: ""This forecast underscores exactly why our plans to increase productivity and ensure we get the very best deal with the EU are vitally important.""

Another person died after being taken to hospital. Detectives have described the ""horrific tragedy"" in San Antonio as a case of human trafficking. The driver has been arrested and will be charged. Weather in the area had been hot and dry, with firefighters claiming the air conditioning unit inside the truck was not working. The US attorney for the western district of Texas, Richard Durbin, described the heat as ""punishing"" at this time of year, adding: ""These people were helpless in the hands of their transporters. Imagine their suffering, trapped in a stifling trailer in 100-plus degree heat."" He described the immigrants as victims of ""ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the well-being of their fragile cargo"". Police were called to the scene after a person from the truck approached a Walmart employee and asked for water. Surveillance footage showed several vehicles had come to the car park to pick up travellers who had made it out of the truck alive. San Antonio fire chief Charles Hood said: ""They were very hot to the touch. So these people were in this trailer without any signs of any type of water. It was a mass casualty situation for us."" The city is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico's Nuevo Leon state, and illegal immigration into the US is a daily occurrence. Most of the migrants are from Mexico and Central America, and come to the US in search of better-paying work. Scores of people have died in recent years while trying to make the dangerous journey. In May 2003, 19 immigrants being transported from South Texas to Houston died inside a sweltering tractor-trailer. Prosecutors alleged the driver had refused to free them - despite hearing begging and screaming for their lives as they succumbed to the stifling heat. He is currently serving a 34-year jail sentence."
2017-07-23,Trade Secretary Liam Fox is reportedly open to importing chlorine-washed chickens from the US in order to secure a post-Brexit trade deal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170724063510/http://news.sky.com/story/liam-fox-open-to-importing-us-chlorinated-chicken-10959270,"Dr Fox is travelling to Washington DC where he will meet US trade representative Robert Lighthizer for two days of talks at the first UK-US trade and investment working group. The American Farming Association is adamant any deal must include agriculture, meaning chlorinated chickens, hormone-fed beef and genetically modified crops could be exported to the UK. The Daily Telegraph reports a cabinet split on the issue, with Dr Fox and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arguing their case against Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The Adam Smith Institute, a UK think-tank, has called for the Government to scrap the EU ban on chlorine-washed chickens. It said US chickens were more than a fifth cheaper than in the UK and claimed that a person would have to eat three chlorine-washed chickens daily for an extended period to risk any harm. Of his visit, Dr Fox said: ""Although it's too early to say exactly what would be covered in a potential deal, the working group is the means to ensure we get to know each other's issues and identify areas where we can work together to strengthen trade and investment ties."" The Foreign Secretary, meanwhile, is in New Zealand as part of a nine-day overseas tour. Mr Johnson was welcomed onto a marae (Maori meeting ground) in Kaikoura shortly after his arrival in New Zealand, which he reportedly described as ""the most mind-numbingly beautiful country that I have ever seen"". During his short visit, Mr Johnson will meet Prime Minister Bill English and foreign minister Gerry Brownlee. He will also unveil a new UK war memorial at Pukeahu in Wellington, laying a wreath to commemorate the shared sacrifices of both countries. Mr Johnson will then visit Australia for talks with foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop. Under European Union rules, trade deals cannot be signed until after the UK's divorce from the EU is finalised but it is hoped these talks will pave the way for quick agreements with the two countries."

GOSH, which says Charlie's life support treatment should stop, revealed on Saturday that it had contacted police following death threats and a ""shocking and disgraceful tide"" of hostility and disturbance at the London medical facility. Charlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, said they faced a ""backlash"" after the revelation, adding that they ""do not and have not ever condoned any threatening or abusive remarks"" towards GOSH staff. Ms Yates said: ""Despite conflicting issues, we have always had the utmost respect for all the staff who work tirelessly at Great Ormond Street Hospital and the very difficult jobs they do every day. ""Like them we have been shocked by some of the public response to this case and agree with them that it is disgraceful that doctors have received death threats."" Charlie, who is 11 months old, suffers from a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. He also has brain damage. On Friday, GOSH lawyer Katie Gollop QC told the High Court that a report on the child's latest MRI scan made for ""sad reading"". Ms Yates burst into tears and said: ""We haven't even read it."" Mr Gard then looked directly at Ms Gollop and shouted ""evil"" before the couple stormed out. Mr Justice Francis asked Ms Gollop not to reveal full details of the report and indicated that Charlie's parents should be given time to consider it privately. Ms Yates and Mr Gard have already lost battles in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in London. However, they were able to take their fight back to the High Court after securing what they say is new evidence. Mr Justice Francis said he would not re-run the case but would consider any ""new material""."

Detectives have sealed off the centre of the town, which lies on the border with Germany. Investigators have said the attack was not an act of terrorism. The suspect - described as balding, 6ft 2in tall and with an unkempt appearance - is believed to be driving a Volkswagen Caddy with Swiss number plates. Police have warned that the suspect is dangerous, but it is not clear whether he is still armed with the chainsaw. The emergency services were called at 10.39am (9.39am UK time) on Monday morning after the attacker entered an office building on a popular shopping street. An insurance company which is based inside that building told Swiss media that two of its employees are being operated on in hospital. Schaffhausen is a small medieval town with a population of approximately 36,000 people."

His case has also been much misunderstood. As Mr Justice Francis said in court: ""The world of social media doubtless has very many benefits but one of its pitfalls… is that when cases such as this go viral, the watching world feels entitled to express opinions, whether or not they are evidence-based."" Connie Yates and her partner Chris Gard will always believe that experimental nucleoside treatment could have saved their son. ""Had Charlie been given the treatment sooner,"" she said in court, ""he would have had the potential to be a normal, healthy little boy."" Not so, said Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. From the moment of Charlie's diagnosis, his prognosis was bleak. No human or animal with Charlie's condition had received nucleoside treatment, so the hospital needed ethical approval for trying it. In January, shortly before the hospital was due to seek that permission, Charlie's seizures became more frequent and he was diagnosed with severe epileptic encephalopathy. The doctors concluded he had suffered irreversible neurological damage and that there was no chance nucleoside treatment could benefit him. Charlie's parents believed his brain was not damaged. They pinned their hopes on Professor Michio Hirano, who had offered to treat their son in New York. But at that stage he had never examined Charlie or even read his full medical records. A doctor should always see a patient before a court can sensibly rely on his evidence, Mr Justice Francis observed. Great Ormond Street Hospital was concerned to hear that Professor Hirano retained a financial interest in some of the compounds he had proposed prescribing for Charlie. As for the claim that Charlie had been a prisoner of the National Health Service, Mr Justice Francis said this was the antithesis of the truth. With an implied nod towards the United States, where this case has been so badly misunderstood, he pointed out that judges such as him were ""fiercely independent of the state"". Charlie Gard's case has a lot to teach us. But to learn those lessons we must begin with the evidence."

Chief Constable Mike Barton said: ""People who use an app on their mobile phone or tablet to remotely turn on a television or cooker, or check a fridge contents when they're out shopping, are running a huge risk because those appliances are linked to their whole home internet system, including perhaps their bank account, but are usually the weakest link in terms of their security. ""It's like leaving a window open when you go on holiday and letting a burglar in to raid your home. ""Criminals aren't hacking fridges at the moment, and it's sounds preposterous but the potential is there. People want to know how secure their mobile phone is, but they tend not to worry about the security of their new smart kettle. ""Customers should be able to ask about security because they could risk losing their life savings."" Mr Barton, who is the UK's policing lead for crime operations, said manufacturers should give smart gadgets a security rating so customers can consider it along with quality, price and energy efficiency. A report this year has already warned that smart gadgets such phones, watches and fitness trackers, even baby monitors and pacemakers, could be targeted by cyber criminals to hold users to ransom over their personal data. It has been forecast that by 2020 there could be 21 billion connected devices used by consumers and businesses around the world. Mr Barton, the Chief Constable of Durham, said that in last year's British Crime Survey one-in-three people said they had been affected by online crime and were worried about their internet vulnerability. He said: ""Quite rightly, police are often accused of being slow to react to cyber crime. This time we are trying to be ahead of the curve, so that nobody can say we didn't warn of the vulnerability. When Sir Robert Peel founded the Metropolitan Police in 1829 the guiding principle was the prevention of crime, said Mr Barton. He was simply following that lead. ""Before there is a mushrooming of items in everyone's homes all linked to the internet, let's make sure that everything is safe so we can prevent crime."" Mr Barton also called on internet companies to invest some of their ""eye-watering"" profits in stamping out online child abuse images. He said police were using up hard-pressed resources arresting around 450 suspected paedophiles every month. He said he could not understand why it appeared so difficult for service providers to rid their sites of such child images. He called on companies to ban for life customers who use social media sits to abuse or harass others."
2017-07-24,Developers could be banned from selling new-build houses as leaseholds to prevent homeowners being left with extortionate fees.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/leasehold-could-be-banned-for-new-homes-10960296,"More than four million people live in leasehold properties in England, giving them the legal right to occupy and use the property for a set period - usually 99 to 999 years. But the associated fees - including service charges and ground rents - can increase by huge amounts each year, leaving some leasehold properties unsellable. Ground rent can increase at such a rate that a homeowner could end up having to find many thousands of pounds a year, on top of service charges and their own mortgage payments. Under plans put forward by Communities Secretary Sajid Javid leaseholds on new builds would be illegal, while ground rents would be massively reduced. Legal loopholes would be closed to protect leaseholders exposed to possession orders and rules on Help to Buy equity loans would change so they could only be used for ""new build houses on acceptable terms"". Leaseholders pay fees to the freeholder, who owns the ground on which the home is built. The system has existed for a long time in England and Wales and is particularly common for blocks of flats. But the trend for new homes being sold as leaseholds has grown in recent years, particularly in the North West of England. Mr Javid said: ""It's clear that far too many new houses are being built and sold as leaseholds, exploiting home buyers with unfair agreements and spiralling ground rents. ""Enough is enough. These practices are unjust, unnecessary and need to stop. ""Our proposed changes will help make sure leasehold works in the best interests of home buyers now and in the future."" Sir Peter Bottomley, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on leasehold reform, welcomed the proposals but said action was also needed to help those with existing leases. The proposals are subject to an eight-week consultation."

2017-07-24,The row over chlorinated chicken is set to intensify with a warning that cheap imported food could threaten farm animal welfare standards after Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/post-brexit-trade-deals-may-lower-uk-animal-welfare-standards-10960894,"The claim, from a powerful House of Lords committee, follows criticism of Liam Fox's controversial plans to allow chlorine-washed chicken from the US into the UK. The International Trade Secretary, visiting Washington to negotiate a US-UK trade deal, has accused the British media of being ""obsessed with chlorine-washed chickens"". But peers claim a post-Brexit increase in imports from countries operating lower farm animal welfare standards could put UK producers at a competitive disadvantage. The warning comes from the House of Lords' EU energy and environment sub-committee in a report on the impact of Brexit on farm animal welfare. :: Why Fox's chicken plan could ruffle feathers ""The UK has some of the highest farm animal welfare standards in the world and UK producers are rightly proud of those,"" said the sub-committee chairman and Liberal Democrat peer Lord Teverson. ""We see no reason why Brexit should diminish those, as long as the Government is aware of the challenges ahead and acts accordingly. ""We heard evidence of undeniable concern that opening up the UK market to free global trade poses a number of issues. ""The Government may find it hard to reconcile its free trade ambitions with its commendable desire for preserving high farm animal welfare standards. ""We heard overwhelming support for farm animal welfare standards to be maintained or improved. ""To help achieve that, we urge the Government to secure the inclusion of high farm animal welfare standards in any free trade agreements it negotiates after Brexit. ""Whilst Brexit provides the UK with the unique opportunity to review and potentially improve farm animal welfare standards, the Government will need to consider the effect of increasing standards on the competitiveness of UK producers as well the future trading relationship with the EU."" The report follows criticism of Dr Fox from Cabinet colleagues, opposition MPs and environmentalists for pursuing a trade deal with the US which would include agriculture. That would potentially mean cheap imports into the UK of chlorine-washed chicken, which is currently banned by the EU but is considerably cheaper than European-produced chicken. During his Washington visit, Dr Fox was clearly irritated when he was asked in a post-speech Q&A if he would feel comfortable eating a chlorinated chicken. ""The British media are obsessed with chlorine-washed chickens, a detail of the very end stage of one sector of a potential free trade agreement,"" he said. Dr Fox is reported to have said the Americans have been eating chlorinated chicken perfectly safely for years and that a meaningful trade deal must include agriculture. But new Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who last week promised to deliver a ""green Brexit"", has insisted that British food standards should not be downgraded in any way. And Mr Gove's predecessor, Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom, says poor quality imports could damage British farming. Dr Fox was also ridiculed by Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner. ""This just goes to show that you should never trust a Fox in your hen coop,"" said Mr Gardiner. And James McGrory, executive director of the pro-Remain campaign group Open Britain, said it was time for Dr Fox to devour a chlorine-washed chicken ""If the International Trade Secretary wants the public to trust him, he needs to take the opportunity while he's in the US and devour a chlorine-washed chicken live on camera,"" said Mr McGrory."

Toilet rolls, coffee and fruit juice are among the 2,529 goods that are also getting smaller without getting any cheaper. While the move has had little impact on the headline rate of inflation, the change in packet size has contributed 1.22 percentage points to the rate of inflation for products such as sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionary. The ONS said most manufacturers blamed the need to resize their products on rising raw material costs. But the European import price of sugar sank to its lowest level on record in March this year, while cocoa prices have dropped sharply since the record highs seen in 2015, the ONS said. In November 2016, Mondelez, the maker of the iconic triangular bar Toblerone, said it had increased the spacing between the distinctive chunks and reduced its weight by almost 10% due to rising ingredient costs. The same month, Mars too pointed to rising costs for its decision to shrink the size of Maltesers packets by 15%. In recent years the firm has also come under fire for reducing the size of Mars and Snickers bars. Since Brexit, the pound has tumbled against the US dollar, making imported goods more expensive. However, the ONS said it had seen no evidence of a Brexit effect on the shrinking size of chocolate bars. ""Manufacturers' costs may also be rising because of the recent fall in the value of the pound - leading some commentators to attribute shrinkflation on the UK's decision to leave the European Union,"" the ONS said. ""But our analysis doesn't show a noticeable change following the referendum that would point towards a Brexit effect. ""Furthermore, others (including Which?) had been observing these shrinking pack sizes long before the EU referendum, and several manufacturers have denied that this is a major factor."""
2017-07-24,The Transport Secretary has come under fire for backing London's Crossrail 2 scheme after cutting plans for rail electrification in Wales and northern England.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/crossrail-funding-anger-after-northern-england-electrification-cuts-10959829,"Chris Grayling has pledged to work with London mayor Sadiq Khan to ensure Crossrail 2, the multibillion north-south rail line running across the capital between Hertfordshire and Surrey, was ""fair to the UK taxpayer"". But Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said people in the region have had to put up with ""sub-standard"" rail services for decades and would ""simply not accept"" that spending billions more on transport in London was the ""highest priority"". And Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram also queried the announcements, saying that while he did not ""begrudge"" the investment in Crossrail 2, there needed to be balanced spending to ""support growth in the North as well"". He also said the announcement was ""a bit of a surprise"" given it was not in the Conservative manifesto. Mr Grayling was criticised last week for scrapping the long-awaited rail electrification plans on the main lines from Cardiff to Swansea and Kettering to Sheffield. On Monday it was revealed that Mr Grayling and Mr Khan had agreed on the need for new infrastructure in the capital during a meeting last week, as well as a funding package which ""works for both London and the rest of the country"". Mr Grayling said he was a ""supporter"" of Crossrail 2, but warned that ""we have to ensure that we get this right"" given the price tag. Mr Burnham said the announcement would cause ""widespread anger"" in the North, saying: ""It will not escape people's notice that this commitment to London today comes just days after the Transport Secretary cancelled electrification schemes all over the country. ""It raises the question of whether taxpayers everywhere else outside of London are paying to make Crossrail 2 viable."" Mr Burnham added: ""The time has passed where we can take these decisions lying down. ""I will today be contacting fellow metro mayors and council leaders across the North of England to consider how we best challenge this Government's continued neglect of transport in the North together."" Mr Rotheram said: ""Sadly the juxtaposition of last week's cancellation of northern rail electrification schemes and this week's green light for Crossrail, suggests it is just going to be business as usual from this Government when it comes to transport investment."" The Department for Transport said plans to electrify the Transpennine route have not been scrapped. A spokesman said major upgrades to the Manchester - Leeds - York route were currently being ""designed and developed, to enable us to deliver better journeys for passengers from 2022"". He added: ""Passengers expect high quality rail services and we are committed to electrification where it delivers benefits, but will also take advantage of new technology to improve journeys."" The spokesman added that it has not yet been decided whether the entire line will be electrified, and an investment decision will be made next year. An analysis by the independent think-tank IPPR North found the North of England would have got £59bn more over the last decade, had it received the same infrastructure spending per person as London."
2017-07-24,The first phase of a four-year £246m Government investment into battery technology has been launched in a move that could help bring down household electricity bills.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/246m-government-drive-to-make-uk-leader-in-battery-technology-10959431,"The long-term vision includes creating giant battery facilities around the National Grid to store excess wind and solar energy for when demand rises. In addition, new rules will help households with solar panels to generate and store their own electricity with new battery technology and sell it back to the Grid when they do not need it. They will also reduce costs for people and businesses who power down appliances at peak times and use electricity at cheaper times. The Government and Energy regulator Ofgem estimate that consumers could save between £17bn and £40bn by 2050. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark unveiled details of the first phase, known as the Faraday Challenge, on Monday. This includes a £45m competition to establish a centre for battery research which he said would help make the UK a world leader in the design, development and manufacture of electric batteries. This will be spearheaded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to bring the best minds and facilities together to create a 'battery institute' to make products more accessible and affordable. A three-month consultation earlier this year on an industrial strategy to increase UK productivity and growth attracted more than 1,900 written responses from businesses and organisations. A shift to cleaner energy and technologies such as electric cars has made the design, development and manufacture of batteries a top industrial priority. Mr Clark said: ""A smarter energy system will create new businesses and high-skilled jobs, while making sure our infrastructure is able to cope with demand."" Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate and energy at WWF, said battery storage was a ""game-changer"" in the ability to produce clean power from renewables. ""These technologies give us flexibility to run on solar when the sun isn't shining, and be powered by wind when it is still. ""It will support the transition to electric cars and enable our homes to be more efficient - which means cheaper, as well as cleaner and greener energy."" Dr Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said the strategy was ""a positive next step for the electricity sector"". ""It makes sense to encourage behavioural changes in this way. Apart from potentially saving consumers money, it also allows us to make better use of our resources. She added: ""Continued development across the energy system from multiple renewable and low emissions technologies remains vital to making the best use of our limited resources and meeting our long term emissions targets."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey claimed the announcement was a ""damp squib"". ""The Government's promise of investment in battery technology is simply a re-announcement of funding promised back in April as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, and their record of supporting emerging green industries is abysmal,"" she said."
2017-07-24,"Three miles off Spain's Costa Blanca, Vicente Sana and his crew pull in their first catch of the day, but as the nets are opened onto the deck, plastic and rubbish tumbles out with the fish.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/sky-ocean-rescue-spanish-fishermen-find-new-way-to-clear-oceans-of-plastic-10959255,"Fisherman Paco Perez points out a bit of old tyre, a diver's fin, water bottles and yoghurt pots. He tells me this is normal, that they're seeing more plastic in the Mediterranean now than in the past. ""Why?"" I ask. ""I don't know,"" he replies. ""I guess people are throwing away more, but we notice it more in the summer."" A recent survey by Greenpeace found 96% of litter floating on the surface of the Mediterranean was plastic. Globally, it is estimated that as much as 12.7 million metric tonnes of plastic enters the ocean each year. Vicente and his crew, along with about 2,000 fishermen in Spain, are now working with clothing company Ecoalf to turn plastic found in the sea into fabric. ""We make our living from the sea so we have to clean it up,"" he explains. ""Everything we catch, instead of throwing it back, which would be easy, we just separate into bags and in the afternoon we deposit them in the container."" Environmentally, working on a trawler causes controversy, so some of them see the project as doing their bit. The rubbish that is collected onboard is thrown into bright yellow bins in the port. The plastic is then separated and taken by Ecoalf to be broken into chips and then pellets, which can eventually be spun into thread. The end results include jackets, trainers and backpacks - all made from recycled plastic. At the company's store in Madrid, founder Javier Goyeneche explains how his dismay at the amount of waste produced by the fashion world made him want to make a clothing line that was more sustainable. So far they have transformed 30 million used bottles into material but Mr Goyaneche says the pollution is widespread: ""We did a trial test with a thousand divers (in Thailand) in January and we took 7.5 tonnes of waste in one day out of the ocean, 7.5 kilos per diver. ""It's not a problem of Spain or of Thailand, it's the same problem in Mexico, Columbia, in Hawaii. This is a worldwide problem."" Of course, it is not just fish swimming with plastic. Thousands of holidaymakers pack onto the popular beaches of the Costa Blanca. The fishermen told me tourism had increased the pollution in the sea. The fishermen's livelihoods depend on cleaning up the water. The pollution is killing off their product. In Vicente's words: ""No fish means no work."" The rest of us won't go untouched; the plastic that is filling up our seas will eventually end up on our plates. Sky News launched its Sky Ocean Rescue campaign earlier this year aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the world's seas. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"

Police began a search of Milton landfill site in Cambridgeshire, after CCTV footage showed the 23-year-old entering a bin loading bay, leading them to believe he could have been brought to the site in a waste lorry. But the five-month search was brought to an end on Friday when officers found ""no trace"" of the missing serviceman. Talking about the search for her son, Nicola Urquhart, herself a PC with Police Scotland, told Sky News: ""I knew the search was going to be called off for about two weeks before it was and I didn't have a problem. ""However, it was somewhat of a shock to find out they were finishing the search but they still think Corrie's in the landfill."" At a news conference on Friday, police said they have handed back control of the 48-hectare landfill site and intend to have it filled in later this week. The ""unprecedented"" search, which has seen 6,500 tonnes of waste sifted through, is understood to have cost £1.2m, but police said the search has not been halted due to the cost. Ms Urquhart said: ""I just don't understand that, if money isn't an issue, why have they stopped searching if they still believe he's in there? It's a question that I will be asking them."" Police have said they have searched the area where the wasted from the lorry was deposited, but following that, said ""it's very difficult to establish exactly where we would search for Corrie"". Ms Urquhart said she hopes it does not come to a situation where she is forced to seek an injunction. She said: ""I'm not asking them just to keep searching indefinitely in the landfill area. We're talking about one specific cell - it's the only one that was open when Corrie went missing. I don't think it's unreasonable to say 'can that cell be finished?'"" So far over 21,000 people have signed a petition saying they want the police to continue via the Find Corrie page on Facebook. Ms Urquhart also spoke about the possibility of asking the military or members of the public to assist in what is left of the landfill search. She asked: ""Would it be an option for me to pay to get the rubbish taken out of the landfill and for civilians to search through it? There must be something. ""It seems quite ridiculous to say we know he's in here, it's our longest line of enquiry, money isn't an issue but we're not going to search any longer. There must be some way of finding a compromise here."" Last month, Mr McKeague's girlfriend April Oliver announced the vanished serviceman had become a father with the birth of their daughter."

Dr Hirano had offered to help Charlie Gard but Great Ormond Street Hospital were adamant the treatment would not help the British baby. After Charlie's parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates withdrew their bid to take him to the US for the treatment, the hospital's lawyer Katie Gollop QC criticised Professor Hirano. She said the hospital hoped those, like Professor Hirano, who ""have provided the opinions that have so sustained Charlie's parents, their hopes and thus this protracted litigation with its many consequences, will also find much upon which to reflect"". She was joined in her criticism by Lord Robert Winston, professor of science and society at Imperial College London, who told Sky News that Professor Hirano had been ""wicked"" to give Charlie's parents the ""idea that somehow had this baby been treated earlier it would have made a difference"". But Mr Estopinan, who has met Charlie's parents and been in contact with them throughout their battle, described the doctor as ""an angel"" and ""a saint"". He told Sky News: ""He saved my son and he has saved about 16 or 18 other children around the world with these devastating diseases and he is coming up with new, experimental medications for other neural generative muscular disorders. ""It is unfortunate and regrettable that GOSH decided to fight for Charlie to die in the legal courts in the UK rather than to treat him in the hospital. ""As doctors, everyone would expect they would try to save his life and fight for his life but regrettably GOSH and Charlie's doctors fought for him to die."" He described Professor Hirano as ""an incredible... brilliant scientist... and incredible medical doctor and a compassionate father"". He said the professor had ""wanted to save"" Charlie but that the hospital had ""allowed (him) to waste away for eight months"", something he described as ""shameful"" and ""despicable"". ""We live in 2017,"" he said. ""This is a tech-advanced society. ""Without insulting anyone, I highly recommend these doctors in the UK to get informed."""

Global growth rose 19% over the period, while European sales also grew by 29%. Business in the US was also up 40%, while in Asia and Australia sales climbed 35%. Chief executive Kevin Brennan said he expected the company, which employs 650 people, to ride out any Brexit impact to its European business when the UK leaves the European Union. But he asserted the firm was keeping a close eye on how the divorce negotiations unfold. He said: ""Hard Brexit tariffs would not be great for us, but it wouldn't be the end of the world."" Mr Brennan continued: ""We are running a company where we believe we can quadruple the business to one billion US dollars. Europe plays a part in that but it isn't essential to achieving that. ""The UK business is still a business with incredibly strong growth. The US is a business with enormous scale potential to us, alongside Australia and Asia. ""We are still taking a positive view on commercial investment in Europe. We continue to invest significantly into Germany, Italy and the Nordics. ""But equally we know that our category is growing everywhere in the world that if Europe gets less attractive, we can divert our growth to other places."" Last week the pound tumbled to an eight-month low against the euro, slipping close to €1.11. It was also lower against the US dollar, dipping below $1.30 after spending several days above that level. The firm has so far managed to avoid Brexit-induced price hikes following sterling's collapse since last June's vote to exit the EU. However, Mr Brennan said he could not guarantee costs will not rise in the future. He said the company was ""broadly neutral"" to the Brexit-hit pound, with rising import prices being countered by improving export sales. Quorn, a meat substitute made from fungus, is sold on its own for use in recipes at home or in ready meals and products that mimic items such as burgers and sausages."
2017-07-24,"The Highway Code's stopping distances for drivers are ""woefully short"", according to road safety campaigners.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/highway-code-stopping-distances-woefully-wrong-10960892,"The current distances underestimate the time it takes for a driver to think and should be re-examined, a study commissioned by the charity Brake concludes. The study found it takes an average of 1.5 seconds to spot a hazard and apply the brakes, more than double the 0.67 seconds used in the Department for Transport's book. This means the stopping distance for a car travelling at 20mph is 19 metres - seven metres more than that specified in the Highway Code. At 40mph, it is 51 metres - 15 metres more; and at 70mph, it is 121 metres, which is 25 metres more than in the code. Such differences should prompt the Government to increase stopping distances ""as a matter of urgency"", Brake said. Spokesman Jason Wakeford said: ""These figures suggest stopping distances taught to new drivers in the Highway Code fall woefully short. ""A true understanding of how long it takes to stop a car in an emergency is one of the most important lessons for new drivers. ""Understanding true average thinking time reminds all drivers how far their car will travel before they begin to brake - as well as highlighting how any distraction in the car which extends this time, like using a mobile phone, could prove fatal."" RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said the new figures should be taken seriously. He said: ""From time to time, new evidence will come to light that means it is necessary to update the Highway Code and perhaps this is one such instance. ""While the ability for cars to be able to brake more quickly has improved, our reaction times clearly haven't."" The Department for Transport said it would ""carefully consider"" the findings."

The hospital told Sky News the programme, which so far has recruited 10 doctors, made more financial sense than competing against other trusts for staff. Dr Miriam Harris, the clinical lead in the Northwick Park emergency medicine department, said: ""Rather than offering large salaries, which is what we tried to do before and got caught up in a bidding war with all other hospitals in London, we were offering to train people and invest in them and their future."" :: Public sector pay cap staying, says No 10 Dr Lajeesh Vettikat, a specialist A&E registrar from New Delhi, said he had been surprised by the pressure on A&E departments. He told Sky News: ""I had read about the A&E sector - now I know how real the shortage is in terms of doctors and nursing staff. ""This is the biggest A&E department in London and we have about 30 doctors a day here, but the number of patients in A&E is so huge we end up seeing patients in the corridors, in the back of ambulances, in the waiting rooms, in the relatives' rooms. ""It is really worrying but we are working really hard to make sure the patients are safe and the department is safe."" Northwick Park is also training some nurses to become advanced clinical practitioners, an intermediate qualification that lets them take on some doctors' duties. These include prescribing medicines and discharging, which is crucial to freeing up beds and improving the flow of patients through the hospital. :: NHS hospital and ambulance trusts run up £700m deficit The measures come as the NHS reveals new figures on Tuesday that will set out the scale of the recruitment crisis facing hospital trusts. They are expected to show tens of thousands of vacancies for doctors, dentists, nurses and midwives across the country. The most recent official figures, for the year to March 2016, showed almost 80,000 vacancies across the NHS. The Royal College of Nursing estimates there are about 24,000 unfilled nursing posts and thousands of vacancies for doctors. Following Freedom of Information requests, several hospital trusts have admitted to having more than 1,000 vacancies across their services, raising concerns over patient safety. The Department of Health says 5,000 new doctors will have qualified by 2020 but last week Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said hospitals would have to hire about 2,000 more doctors from overseas to alleviate staffing pressures. That process may be complicated by Brexit, which has raised uncertainties for EU citizens working or considering working in the UK."

2017-07-24,"To educate, to inform and entertain is the BBC's motto.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/the-bbc-pay-gap-is-bad-its-class-gap-is-worse-10957166,"Well, after this week we're certainly better educated and informed about the salaries of its top on-screen personalities. Less entertaining, however, were some of the inequalities the list revealed: of the 96 names on the list of the BBC's mega earners, just under a third were women. Moreover the highest-paid woman was paid considerably less than the top male earners. Many absolute stars, like Emily Maitlis and Sarah Montague, failed to make the cut for doing much the same job as their male counterparts. Cue righteous and rightful anger from all sides, even from publications not exactly known as scions of feminism. :: Full list of BBC stars earning more than £150k Likewise many commentators were justly angry at the small number of ethnic minority presenters on the list - a mere 10. But in all the sound and the fury, one clarion call was mysteriously nowhere to be heard: a key piece of the puzzle which, in all of the lamentations over diversity, was time and again too poor to mention: class. Which is curious, because if we actually talked or even cared about this peculiar taboo, we might begin to see one of the reasons the gender and race pay gaps exist in the first place. I've been doing some research and number crunching. The list contains over 80 on-screen names. No fewer than 45% of the BBC's best paid stars went to private schools. That compares to 7% of the nation overall. Just think about that. If you send your child to private school it increases their chances of being one of the biggest names in TV and media by a factor of six. The gender pay gap may be too large but it's not nearly as big as the class pay gap for the people who never made it in the first place because of their background. The injustice is pretty overwhelming: after all, are we really saying that those who are lucky enough to be born into households which can afford to pay for private school fees are six times more talented? Six times better imbued with the skills required to be a successful BBC actor, sports presenter or journalist? And it's in journalism where the problem is most egregious. Three in five of the best-paid BBC on-air journalists and presenters went to independent schools. That means you're nine times more likely to be a top BBC journalist if you went to private school. If you're a working class girl, the odds are longer still. From Jeremy Vine to Mishal Husain from Sophie Raworth to Nick Robinson, the list is eye-wateringly long. Much attention was paid to the pay disparity on the Today programme, less to the fact that four of its five presenters went to private schools. Tellingly, even among many of those who did go to state schools, the vast majority went to grammars. It's possible to count the number of ""bog standard comprehensive"" working class boys and girls on one hand. In the 1810s it was said that the Battle of Waterloo was fought and won on the playing fields of Eton so dominant was the school in the top brass of the Army. In 2017, its equivalent is the six o'clock news. Allow me to declare an interest: I am a comprehensive school boy. I don't belittle for one moment my outstanding colleagues in TV or journalism who went to private school - they are all very talented people. Likewise, I'm a former proud practitioner at the BBC and would defend it to the end of the Earth. And it's quite unfair to single out the BBC in this regard anyway, I'm sure the pattern of private school dominance is repeated across our industry: at Sky, ITV and across Fleet Street. But I desperately want to see more state schoolers from working class backgrounds get into TV and media and I want to see us all try and do more about it. We might start on days like last Wednesday by actually talking about the problem at all. Because class matters in journalism even more than across the other areas covered on that list. We journalists are the ones who day after day, are supposed to reflect Britain unto itself. We're supposed to be the ones who find and tell the stories that matter to our audiences, and for the BBC, all of its licence fee payers. How are we supposed to do that if we are drawn from an increasingly narrow social caste? Maybe, just maybe, if we had more kids in journalism who grew up in tower blocks, we'd have been better at shining a light on the living conditions of some of our fellow citizens, like those who lived and died in Grenfell Tower. Or we would be less disposed to the curse of group think which has led journalists to call it wrong time after time in recent years, whether it be Corbyn, Trump or Brexit. And that's why it matters who is making editorial judgements off screen too. The BBC also published the number of its senior managers who earn more than £150,000 too, to considerably less fanfare. It is again dominated by those sporting the (literally) golden ticket of a private school education: James Purnell the director of radio; James Harding, the director of news; the editors of the flagships Newsnight and Today, Ian Katz and Sarah Sands. Maybe the fact that the top echelons of the media are dominated by private schoolers explains some of the gender and BAME pay gaps. If you go to private school you're more likely to hire other people like you, other private schoolers, who are less likely to be from an ethnic minority background. Open the talent pool up to more talented, ambitious state school educated girls and they might look a lot more kindly on the pay of their female on-screen colleagues vis-a-vis their male counterparts. It's no secret that it's hard to get into journalism and the media. Unpaid internships and an expensive postgraduate degree from City university (£9,000 a year) are almost as obligatory as passports at the border these days. Not to mention the fact that virtually all opportunities are concentrated in London. None of this is the fault of any of the people on that list nor any one person in management of any organisation. But I do think, frankly, that many senior BBC managers and others from across the media's boss class generally care about class diversity much less because it's less tangible than sex or race. Easier to point to new women or BAME hires, less easy and less headline grabbing to talk about class, which is, after all a more fluid concept yet connected intrinsically to both. But just because it's harder and less 'zeitgeisty' doesn't mean it's not important and we should start to recognise that diversity in our society is more than just about your sex or gender. It's a complicated, tightly woven tapestry and your background and class, for which your educational background is a pretty decent indicator, is crucial. Is a poor working class man from Scunthorpe less diverse than a wealthy ethnic minority woman from Hampstead who went to one of the country's top private schools? I think they both have something to say and we need as many different voices as we can in the makeup of our media. As welcome as it would be, the injustice of inequality won't be righted simply by having equal numbers of men and women on screen even if they're on the same pay. The work will only have just begun. Diversity is about more than what you can see."
2017-07-24,South West Trains has warned its customers to expect delays and cancellations for the rest of the day after a major signal failure.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/passengers-urged-to-avoid-london-waterloo-as-signal-failure-causes-chaos-10959400,"Commuters were urged to avoid London Waterloo altogether during Monday morning's rush hour as the outage brought travel chaos to the country's busiest railway station. Trains across the company's entire network were delayed by up to 90 minutes, while other services were subject to last-minute cancellations. The disruption began when all signalling was lost in the Earlsfield area, leaving SWT unable to run trains into Waterloo. A Network Rail spokesman said: ""We're sorry for the disruption this will cause to people's journeys this morning, and will continue to work to resume a normal service as quickly as possible."" SWT passengers were already facing delays this morning because of a track defect on a set of points between Woking and Surbiton - blocking the London-bound fast line. The disruption comes days before the start of major work at Waterloo to extend platforms, which is set to cause three weeks of delays at the transport hub. Stagecoach has lost the franchise to run SWT, with a consortium of First Group and Hong Kong-based MTR taking over next month. The RMT union has warned that vital services have been left on a knife edge following a series of cuts to railway budgets. General secretary Mick Cash said: ""The state of transport services right across London this morning serves is the clearest possible warning to this Government that their policy of hacking back the budgets of both Network Rail and Transport for London is dragging Tube and rail in the capital city into permanent chaos."""
2017-07-24,Trade Secretary Liam Fox is reportedly open to importing chlorine-washed chickens from the US in order to secure a post-Brexit trade deal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170725033354/http://news.sky.com/story/liam-fox-open-to-importing-us-chlorinated-chicken-10959270,"Dr Fox is travelling to Washington DC where he will meet US trade representative Robert Lighthizer for two days of talks at the first UK-US trade and investment working group. The American Farming Association is adamant any deal must include agriculture, meaning chlorinated chickens, hormone-fed beef and genetically modified crops could be exported to the UK. The Daily Telegraph reports a cabinet split on the issue, with Dr Fox and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arguing their case against Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said it was too early to discuss specific details of any trade deal. :: Why Fox's chicken plan could ruffle feathers He was challenged repeatedly at a regular Westminster media briefing over whether the Government would guarantee to keep EU-level food standards after Brexit. ""Our position when it comes to food is that maintaining the safety and public confidence in the food we eat is of the highest priority. Any future trade deal must work for UK farmers, businesses and consumers,"" he said. The Adam Smith Institute, a UK think-tank, has called for the Government to scrap the EU ban on chlorine-washed chickens. It said US chickens were more than a fifth cheaper than in the UK and claimed that a person would have to eat three chlorine-washed chickens daily for an extended period to risk any harm. Of his visit, Dr Fox said: ""Although it's too early to say exactly what would be covered in a potential deal, the working group is the means to ensure we get to know each other's issues and identify areas where we can work together to strengthen trade and investment ties."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson meanwhile, is in New Zealand as part of a nine-day overseas tour. Mr Johnson was welcomed onto a marae (Maori meeting ground) in Kaikoura shortly after his arrival, describing the country as the most ""mind-blowingly, mind-numbingly beautiful country that I have ever seen"". During the visit he compared the traditional Maori greeting to a headbutt, suggesting the customary pressing of noses, known as the hongi, is like a ""Glasgow kiss"". He also unveiled a new UK war memorial at Pukeahu in Wellington, laying a wreath to commemorate the shared sacrifices of both countries. Mr Johnson will meet Prime Minister Bill English and Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee during his two-day trip. He will then head to Australia for talks with Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop. Under European Union rules, trade deals cannot be signed until after the UK's exit is finalised, but it is hoped these talks will pave the way for quick agreements with the two countries."

He told NME magazine in June he wanted to look at ways to reduce, ameliorate, lengthen the repayment period or ""some other means of reducing that debt burden"". He added: ""I don't see why those that had the historical misfortune to be at university during the £9,000 period should be burdened excessively compared to those that went before or those that come after. ""I will deal with it."" This week Mr Corbyn was accused by senior Tory Iain Duncan Smith of using students as ""electoral fodder"" by indicating he would wipe out their debt. But the Labour leader said his remarks had not represented a ""commitment"" to erase student debt and admitted the party had not known at the time how much such a move would cost. Mr Corbyn said he would be making a statement on the issue soon. He told BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I did not make a commitment we would write it off because I couldn't at that stage. ""I pointed out we had written the manifesto in a short space of time because there was a surprise election but that we would look at ways of reducing that debt burden, recognising that a lot of it is never going to be collected anyway and try and reduce that burden."" He added: ""We never said we would completely abolish it because we were unaware of the size of it at the time."" Conservative MP Jo Johnson, who is universities minister, said Labour made ""outlandish promises to young people during the election"" that the party was now ""shamelessly abandoning"". ""The Labour party's policy platform for students is disintegrating before our eyes. It is becoming ever clearer that Jeremy Corbyn is looking to walk away from a host of undeliverable pre-election promises to students, making this the most blatant example of switch and bait in recent political history. ""Only the Conservatives have a clear plan to tackle our debts while investing in our future so that we can deliver economic security and high quality jobs for hard-working people across the country."" Mr Corbyn's comments come after Education Secretary Justine Greening called on Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, to apologise for saying in the Commons this week that ""we have no plans to write off existing student debt"". The Mail on Sunday reports Ms Greening told her opposite number in a letter that ditching a ""clear commitment"" was ""misleading those who put their faith in you""."

The 39-year-old stepfather flew into a rage at Mountsfield Park in Catford, southeast London, where witnesses heard a man screaming about the loss of a shoe. Sentencing him at Woolwich Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Mark Dennis QC told Iheanacho he had a ""deeply entrenched character flaw"" that ""leads you to overreact and lose your temper"". The judge described how ""the red mist"" came down upon Iheanacho in a ""wholly unnecessary loss of temper"". Alex, whose mother Lilya Breha was in a relationship with Iheanacho, suffered fatal head and stomach injuries and died in hospital two days after the attack. Police investigating the murder later found one of the little boy's trainers in the play area of the park. Judge Dennis said Iheanacho, who has a string of convictions for violent offences, including attacks on ex-partners and robbery, tried to ""cover up"" his crime, giving false accounts to paramedics, hospital staff and police. He carried the little boy's unconscious body to a minicab office and then took him to Ms Breha's flat after the attack, despite the nearest hospital being just five minutes' walk away. Iheanacho, from Hounslow, west London, then attacked his girlfriend when she tried to call an ambulance for her son. She eventually managed to grab the phone as she noticed Alex was growing cold and turning blue, and had stopped breathing. Doctors at Lewisham Hospital tried to resuscitate Alex, but he was transferred to King's College Hospital after a scan revealed severe brain swelling. He was pronounced dead following an unsuccessful operation on 22 November. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Ms Breha described her son as a ""beautiful little angel"" and said she felt her own life had ended with his. ""Nothing will ever be the same without Alex,"" she said. In his own statement, Alex's father said: ""Just thinking about what's happened and trying to put words on paper is tearing me apart."""
2017-07-25,"The Highway Code's stopping distances for drivers are ""woefully short"", according to road safety campaigners.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170726083012/http://news.sky.com/story/highway-code-stopping-distances-woefully-wrong-10960892,"The current distances underestimate the time it takes for a driver to think and should be re-examined, a study commissioned by the charity Brake concludes. The study found it takes an average of 1.5 seconds to spot a hazard and apply the brakes, more than double the 0.67 seconds used in the Department for Transport's book. This means the stopping distance for a car travelling at 20mph is 19 metres - seven metres more than that specified in the Highway Code. At 40mph, it is 51 metres - 15 metres more; and at 70mph, it is 121 metres, which is 25 metres more than in the code. Such differences should prompt the Government to increase stopping distances ""as a matter of urgency"", Brake said. Spokesman Jason Wakeford said: ""These figures suggest stopping distances taught to new drivers in the Highway Code fall woefully short. ""A true understanding of how long it takes to stop a car in an emergency is one of the most important lessons for new drivers. ""Understanding true average thinking time reminds all drivers how far their car will travel before they begin to brake - as well as highlighting how any distraction in the car which extends this time, like using a mobile phone, could prove fatal."" RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said the new figures should be taken seriously. He said: ""From time to time, new evidence will come to light that means it is necessary to update the Highway Code and perhaps this is one such instance. ""While the ability for cars to be able to brake more quickly has improved, our reaction times clearly haven't."" The Department for Transport said it would ""carefully consider"" the findings."

Its electric drivetrain - which is comprised of a collection of components in a vehicle that transfer power from the transmission to the wheels - will be built in Bavaria, before being integrated into the car at the Cowley site. The announcement is a vote of confidence for the 4,500-strong workforce at the UK plant in the run-up to Brexit - and comes just weeks after staff voted to accept a new pensions offer following a series of strikes. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, described the move as ""a huge and totally deserved boost to a world-class workforce that has endured a tough few months"". He said: ""Around the world and for generations, the Mini means made in Britain. With the electric Mini being built in Cowley, the tradition continues but with the added bonus that this is one of the important innovations of tomorrow."" Business Secretary Greg Clark added: ""The automotive industry is a great British success story and the Mini is a big part of that. ""UK car production hit a 10-year high last year, with 1.7 million cars made and over 800,000 people employed across the wider industry. ""We want to see the sector continue to innovate and grow here in the UK, supported by initiatives such as the new battery institute as part of our Industrial Strategy."" BMW said it did not ask for or receive any assurances from the Government before making its decision. In a statement from Munich, the firm said that electrification was one of the central pillars of the group's corporate strategy and that additional electric models would be launched in the coming years and beyond 2020. All of its models were able to be electrified, with a full electric or plug-in hybrid drivetrain being offered in addition to a combustible engine. It expects electric models - which it manufactures at 10 plants across the world - to account for between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025. Volvo became the first traditional car maker earlier this month to commit to including an electric motor in all of its new models from 2019. US firm Tesla's first mass-market electric car, the Model 3, is expected to be unveiled on Friday The first vehicle manufacturing facility to be built in Britain for more than a decade opened in Ansty, Coventry, in March to produce a new electric London black taxi. Latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that 59,000 new alternatively fuelled vehicles have been purchased in the UK so far this year, up 28% over the same period in 2016, amid growing concern about the impact of diesel cars on air quality."

During the consultation, one of the first members of public to speak said: ""I don't think you are going to do us justice. I'm just watching you here. We need someone who's real."" Sky News North of England Correspondent Gerard Tubb who was at the meeting said: ""At times it descended into chaos, with people shouting over one another. ""But the panel led by Sir Martin Moore-Bick did a remarkably good job of calming down some of the more passionate voices."" During the meeting, one woman asked: ""Would the residents get the justice they deserve?"" The panel inquiry chairman replied: ""All I can ask is to give us a chance."" Someone else asked if the report would be acted on, making reference to the Lakanal House fire in 2009, in which six people were killed. Following that fire in Camberwell, south east London, there were calls for sprinkler systems to be retrospectively fitted, however nothing was done. Sir Martin replied: ""What happens as a result of my report is not in my hands I'm afraid."" He went on to promise that the inquiry would look into the specification of the cladding and insulation fitted during the renovations to the tower. Once the report has been produced, it is the Government who will make decisions on future actions. Reacting to calls for the panel to better reflect the ""diversity"" of those on the west London estate, barrister Peter Herbert, who is representing some of the Grenfell families, told Sky News: ""Fifty years ago it may not have mattered that you had a white high court judge and an all-white inquiry team. ""But in the London of 2017, 20 years after the Stephen Lawrence inquiry met with a diverse panel, it is absolutely essential that this community - one of the most diverse in London - sees and hears from people who look and sound like them and understand what it's like to live in a tower block."" Meanwhile, police have said that 40 victims have been formally identified. However, officers have recognised the fact that there are 41 named victims in total, after Grenfell resident Andreia Gomes, who escaped from the fire with her husband and two daughters, gave birth to a still born son, Logan, following the fire.

Trade between the two countries is already worth more than £150bn ($200bn) a year.

But a powerful House of Lords committee is warning that a post-Brexit increase in imports from countries operating lower farm animal welfare standards could put UK producers at a competitive disadvantage. ""The UK has some of the highest farm animal welfare standards in the world and UK producers are rightly proud of those,"" said Liberal Democrat peer Lord Teverson, the chairman of the House of Lords' EU energy and environment sub-committee.

Ms Yates said: ""We promised Charlie every day we would take him home. ""It seems really upsetting after everything we've been through to deny us this."" She was speaking after another day in court, where they were fighting for permission to take Charlie home for his final days. The judge deciding the issue said he believes there are only two options - Great Ormond Street Hospital or a hospice While Charlie's parents want to take him home, the hospital believes he cannot get the specialised care he needs there and is at risk of a ""distressing"" death. Mr Justice Francis will decide on Wednesday what will happen. :: Why doctors are stopping Charlie from going home :: Timeline of parents' battle to save Charlie Speaking on the baby's behalf, lawyer Victoria Butler-Cole told the High Court he would be able go to a hospice ""at the end of this week"". But a lawyer for Charlie's parents, Grant Armstrong, said moving the 11-month-old to a hospice for ""just a period of hours"" would be ""brutal"". Mr Grant accused GOSH of putting ""obstacles"" in the way, and said, ""we struggle with the difficulties the hospital is placing in the way of the parents having a... short period of time before the final act in Charlie's short life"". Ms Yates and her partner Mr Gard withdrew their bid to take their baby to the US for experimental therapy on Monday. They said tests had shown the window of opportunity to help him had closed. Charlie suffers from a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and he also has brain damage. His parents do not expect him to live to his first birthday on 4 August. Meanwhile, the US doctor who was accused of giving Charlie's family ""false hope"" has responded to the claims. Dr Michio Hirano denied he still had a financial interest in the treatment he said could help the baby. He said: ""As I disclosed in court on 13 July, I have relinquished and have no financial interest in the treatment being developed for Charlie's condition. ""Unfortunately a MRI scan of Charlie's muscle tissue conducted in the past week has revealed that it is very unlikely that he would benefit from this treatment."""

James Bond will return to US cinemas on November 8, 2019 with a traditional earlier release in the UK and the rest of the world. pic.twitter.com/6HnaDnfruK Purvis and Wade started in 1999's The World Is Not Enough and penned the last six Bond films. In a statement, the company also confirmed Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli will return as producers. They have been associated with the franchise since the 1970s. ""James Bond will return to US cinemas on November 8, 2019 with a traditional earlier release in the UK and the rest of the world,"" the film's official Twitter account posted on Monday. The announcement comes amid rumours that Craig would not be playing Bond again, after he famously told Time Out magazine he would ""rather slash my wrists"" than do it again. He later excused his comments, saying he has ""the best job in the world"", and ""will keep doing it as long as I still get a kick out of it"". Meanwhile actors like Idris Elba, Tom Hardy and Tom Hiddleston have all said they would be honoured to succeed Craig as the film world's most famous spy. If Daniel Craig does return as Bond, it will be the fifth time he has played the role. His last 007 film, Spectre, was released in 2015 and took more than £95m at the UK box-office - making it the third most successful film of all time in Britain. 2012's Skyfall, which took £103m, is Britain's second biggest grossing film ever."
2017-07-25,"The number of vacant full-time positions in the NHS has risen 10% in the last year, fuelling concerns that a burgeoning recruitment crisis could impact on patient safety.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170726083012/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-england-vacancies-rise-by-10-in-a-year-10960284,"According to the latest figures released by NHS Digital there were 86,055 advertised full-time vacancies in the NHS in England in the first quarter of 2017. In the same period last year there were 78,112, a 10% increase year-on-year. In March, the last month for which figures are available, there were 30,613 vacant full-time positions advertised, compared to 26,424 in the same month in 2016, a rise of 16%. Of the first-quarter vacancies, some 32,929 were for nursing and midwifery posts and 11,155 for medical and dental, which includes doctors. Sky News has spent time at one London hospital that has introduced innovative measures to tackle its own recruitment challenges. Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow has the largest A&E department in London, but is facing rising demand and a shortage of specialist registrars, middle-ranking doctors. Facing competition from other London hospitals that was driving up pay, they decided to recruit directly from India. Miriam Harris, the clinical lead in the Northwick Park emergency medicine department, said: ""Rather than offering large salaries, which is what we tried to do before and got caught up in a bidding war with all other hospitals in London, we were offering to train people and invest in them and their future."" Lajeesh Vettikat, a specialist A&E registrar from New Delhi, said he had been surprised by the pressure on A&E departments. He told Sky News: ""I had read about the A&E sector - now I know how real the shortage is in terms of doctors and nursing staff. ""This is the biggest A&E department in London and we have about 30 doctors a day here, but the number of patients in A&E is so huge we end up seeing patients in the corridors, in the back of ambulances, in the waiting rooms, in the relatives' rooms. ""It is really worrying but we are working really hard to make sure the patients are safe and the department is safe."" Northwick Park is also training some nurses to become advanced clinical practitioners, an intermediate qualification that lets them take on some doctors' duties. These include prescribing medicines and discharging, which is crucial to freeing up beds and improving the flow of patients through the hospital. There are concerns that recruitment is being hampered by uncertainty over Brexit. In June, it was revealed that the number of nurses from the European Union registering to work in the UK has fallen by 96% since the Brexit vote last year. Last week NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said the NHS would have to recruit 2,000 doctors from overseas despite having a target of training 5,000 more home-grown doctors by 2020. The Royal College of Nursing has warned that there are around 25,000 vacancies and warn that the strain on existing staff is putting the NHS at a ""tipping point"". A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""Staffing is a priority - that's why we have invested in the frontline and there are almost 32,400 more professionally qualified clinical staff including almost 11,800 more doctors, and over 12,500 more nurses on our wards, since May 2010."" Labour's shadow health spokesman Justin Mathers told Sky News the latest figures had not come as a surprise. He said: ""We've been warning for some time that the Government were simply not doing enough not only to recruit enough staff but to retain existing staff. ""We know that Brexit has led to a massive reduction in the EU nationals that work here in the health service and we know that figures show that more midwives are leaving the profession than joining it for the first time in the history of the NHS."""

2017-07-25,The mother of missing RAF gunner Corrie McKeague has said she is considering taking out an injunction to stop police filling in a landfill site where they have been searching for her son's body.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170726083012/http://news.sky.com/story/corrie-mckeagues-mother-criticises-ridiculous-decision-to-halt-search-10959976,"The serviceman, from Fife in Scotland, disappeared after a night out with friends in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September last year. Police began a search of Milton landfill site in Cambridgeshire, after CCTV footage showed the 23-year-old entering a bin loading bay, leading them to believe he could have been brought to the site in a waste lorry. But the five-month search was brought to an end on Friday when officers found ""no trace"" of the missing serviceman. Talking about the search for her son, Nicola Urquhart, herself a PC with Police Scotland, told Sky News: ""I knew the search was going to be called off for about two weeks before it was and I didn't have a problem. ""However, it was somewhat of a shock to find out they were finishing the search but they still think Corrie's in the landfill."" At a news conference on Friday, police said they have handed back control of the 48-hectare landfill site and intend to have it filled in later this week. The ""unprecedented"" search, which has seen 6,500 tonnes of waste sifted through, is understood to have cost £1.2m, but police said the search has not been halted due to the cost. Ms Urquhart said: ""I just don't understand that, if money isn't an issue, why have they stopped searching if they still believe he's in there? It's a question that I will be asking them."" Police have said they have searched the area where the wasted from the lorry was deposited, but following that, said ""it's very difficult to establish exactly where we would search for Corrie"". Ms Urquhart said she hopes it does not come to a situation where she is forced to seek an injunction. She said: ""I'm not asking them just to keep searching indefinitely in the landfill area. We're talking about one specific cell - it's the only one that was open when Corrie went missing. I don't think it's unreasonable to say 'can that cell be finished?'"" So far over 21,000 people have signed a petition saying they want the police to continue via the Find Corrie page on Facebook. Ms Urquhart also spoke about the possibility of asking the military or members of the public to assist in what is left of the landfill search. She asked: ""Would it be an option for me to pay to get the rubbish taken out of the landfill and for civilians to search through it? There must be something. ""It seems quite ridiculous to say we know he's in here, it's our longest line of enquiry, money isn't an issue but we're not going to search any longer. There must be some way of finding a compromise here."" Last month, Mr McKeague's girlfriend April Oliver announced the vanished serviceman had become a father with the birth of their daughter."

The list, announced as the 12 phrases most complained about by workers, is a thought shower of jargon that's evolved over decades of changing corporate culture. Some terms were coined by strategists and psychologists who wanted to develop a strong company ethic, encourage employees to believe in their work or improve productivity and efficiency.

2017-07-25,Diesel drivers on congested highways are to face new pollution taxes from 2020 - as the Government signals the end of the road for diesel and petrol cars by 2040.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170726083012/http://news.sky.com/story/petrol-and-diesel-cars-banned-from-uk-roads-by-2040-10962075,"A new air quality strategy to be unveiled by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove will propose that all cars on the UK's roads should eventually be electric or hybrid. But Mr Gove has stopped short of backing an extensive scrappage scheme for diesel cars, as the Government previously intended. Instead he will consult on the idea in the autumn. The new pollution taxes will apply on the UK's busiest roads, mostly in London and big towns and cities, but also on two heavily congested motorways, the M4 near London and the M32 in Bristol. :: Fully electric Mini to be built at UK plant, says BMW But coming just a day after BMW unveiled its new electric mini, to be built at Cowley, Oxford, the major change will come in 2040, when the sale of all new diesel and petrol cars will be banned. The Government has identified 81 major roads in 17 towns and cities where it says urgent action is required because they are in breach of EU emissions standards, putting people's health at risk. The new strategy urges local authorities to attempt to reduce emissions at first by fitting the most polluting diesel vehicles with filters, changing road lay-outs and removing speed humps. But as a last resort councils will be allowed to impose tough levies on the most polluting diesel vehicles as soon as 2020 to bring down the levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide emissions. A Government spokesman said: ""Our plan to deal with dirty diesels will help councils clean up emissions hotspots - often a single road - through common sense measures which do not unfairly penalise ordinary working people. ""Diesel drivers are not to blame and to help them switch to cleaner vehicles the government will consult on a targeted scrappage scheme - one of a number of measures to support motorists affected by local plans."" The strategy will disappoint motoring groups pressing for a diesel scrappage scheme, under which diesel drivers would receive compensation for trading in their polluting vehicles. Instead the Government will hold a consultation on a ""possible"" scrappage scheme in the autumn, which sources have suggested is likely to be ""very, very targeted"". Mr Gove is expected to warn local authorities against ""unfairly penalising"" drivers by imposing pollution taxes and other restrictions on diesel drivers. The Government is concerned that motorists were encouraged to buy diesel vehicles under Labour more than a decade ago because of concerns at the time over carbon emissions. Mr Gove has also performed another U-turn on previous plans which could have seen restrictions on diesel cars across entire city and town centres, instead aiming to reduce emissions on specific roads. In May, Mr Gove's predecessor Andrea Leadsom proposed a ""targeted"" UK scrappage scheme for just 9,000 cars, with owners paid between £1,000 and £2,000 to scrap their car or have them fitted with new emission controls. But that is thought to have been ruled out as too costly and would have provoked a backlash from motorists - including so-called ""white van man"" - and Tory backbenchers. It is estimated that 48 of the most polluted roads are in London. Others have been identified in Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Nottingham, Southampton, Bristol, Bolton, Manchester, Bury, Coventry, Newcastle, Sheffield, Belfast, Cardiff and Middlesbrough. The Government has been forced to come up with tougher measures to target diesel drivers after losing a case against environmental campaigners ClientEarth over breaches of EU emissions standards. Instead of pollution taxes, councils will be urged to improve the flow of traffic with measures such as removing speed humps to prevent cars repeatedly slowing down and speeding up, which almost doubles the amount of harmful gasses they pump out. Other options expected to be put forward include better sequencing of traffic lights to ensure drivers keep arriving at green lights rather than red ones if they drive within the speed limit. Ministers will provide an extra £255m to help councils implement their plans, which could come into force as soon as 2020."

""What the British people want to see is a government that gets on with the job and they've got that with Theresa and we are going to deliver a great Brexit deal.

He said: ""Let's be clear, the election did not evolve entirely in the way the Government had hoped or would have wanted... I'm going to put that out. ""But the Labour Party did not win, they were 50 seats behind. We have a workable system of getting stuff through the House of Commons... we have workable majority with our friends from Northern Ireland.""

But on Tuesday he confirmed the claim - for losses allegedly suffered when his former business Unique Group was destroyed because of the ""industrial scale"" fraud - had been ramped up. Lloyds, which rescued HBOS at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, has set aside a £100m compensation pot for the fraud victims. Mr Edmonds is now pushing for three times that amount for the ""deep distress and public humiliation"" he has suffered. The celebrity, who revealed in an interview last month that he tried to kill himself in 2005 as his firm collapsed, claims Unique Group was among firms affected by the historic £245m loans scam by HBOS employees in Reading, who were jailed earlier this year. In a new statement he described a review being carried out by the bank into the scandal as a ""cynical ploy to keep victims' compensation pay-outs to the bare minimum"". He said: ""We now have documentary evidence to support the view of Thames Valley Police, the judiciary and the CPS that the HBOS criminality extended far beyond the 'Reading 6'. ""This explains why Lloyds created the secretive review process in an attempt to limit their liability to a very small number of victims when of course, as they are well aware, the true figure is in the thousands."" He added: ""Lloyds are about to discover their Griggs Review, a cynical ploy to keep victims' compensation pay-outs to the bare minimum, is like trying to plug an active volcano with a cork."" Lloyds has so far made more than £10m of compensation offers and hardship payments to customers affected by the fraud, which took place between 2003 and 2007. The lender said last week that 30 customers had either now received a compensation offer or were in the ""detailed stages"" of assessment and would receive an offer shortly. Mr Edmonds' solicitor Jonathan Coad, from Keystone Law, has sent a submission of his findings to the bank's review, headed by Professor Russel Griggs, and also to the Thames Valley Police and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards."

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) figures show that a further 28 people died in connection with police pursuits of vehicles in 2016/17 - more than double the previous year's total and the highest amount since 2005/06. In its annual report on deaths during or following police contact, the IPCC also found that 14 people died in or following police custody, the same as in 2015/16 and close to the average since 2009. IPCC chairwoman Dame Anne Owers said the increase in the number of fatal shootings should be viewed against a total of thousands of firearms operations - 14,700 in 2015/16, the latest year for which figures are known. She said: ""The deaths happened across six forces, and one was terrorism-related. ""Investigations into three of the 2016/17 incidents are complete and, as in the great majority of firearms investigations, we have found no indication of misconduct by any firearms officer."" The IPCC will work with police chiefs to decide whether safety and pursuit training given to officers needs to be changed after a rise in road traffic fatalities, which Dame Anne described as ""noticeable"". She said: ""None were in response to emergencies, and two-thirds of the people who died were passengers, bystanders or other road users. ""Pursuits are dynamic and fast-moving events, and there are authorised procedures to ensure that they are as safe as possible."" The report revealed 11 of those who died in or following police custody were known to have a link to alcohol and/or drugs, while eight had mental health issues, as did 40 of the 55 people who died by apparent suicide after release from custody. Dame Anne said ""the great majority of those dying both during and immediately after custody are vulnerable"" which is a ""challenge for policing, but it is also a challenge for the other services that need to be properly resourced to provide support and alternatives to police custody"". The IPCC also investigated 124 other deaths following contact with the police in a wide range of circumstances in 2016/17, up from 102 the previous year."

His case has also been much misunderstood. As Mr Justice Francis said in court: ""The world of social media doubtless has very many benefits but one of its pitfalls… is that when cases such as this go viral, the watching world feels entitled to express opinions, whether or not they are evidence-based."" Connie Yates and her partner Chris Gard will always believe that experimental nucleoside treatment could have saved their son. ""Had Charlie been given the treatment sooner,"" she said in court, ""he would have had the potential to be a normal, healthy little boy."" Not so, said Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. From the moment of Charlie's diagnosis, his prognosis was bleak. No human or animal with Charlie's condition had received nucleoside treatment, so the hospital needed ethical approval for trying it. In January, shortly before the hospital was due to seek that permission, Charlie's seizures became more frequent and he was diagnosed with severe epileptic encephalopathy. The doctors concluded he had suffered irreversible neurological damage and that there was no chance nucleoside treatment could benefit him. Charlie's parents believed his brain was not damaged. They pinned their hopes on Professor Michio Hirano, who had offered to treat their son in New York. But at that stage he had never examined Charlie or even read his full medical records. A doctor should always see a patient before a court can sensibly rely on his evidence, Mr Justice Francis observed. Great Ormond Street Hospital was concerned to hear that Professor Hirano retained a financial interest in some of the compounds he had proposed prescribing for Charlie. As for the claim that Charlie had been a prisoner of the National Health Service, Mr Justice Francis said this was the antithesis of the truth. With an implied nod towards the United States, where this case has been so badly misunderstood, he pointed out that judges such as him were ""fiercely independent of the state"". Charlie Gard's case has a lot to teach us. But to learn those lessons we must begin with the evidence."

The men are accused of killing and raping numerous children and women from the slums close to Pandher's mansion - dubbed the ""house of horrors"" - before dumping them in nearby drains. Investigators say Koli lured victims as young as three into the house where they were raped and murdered. Servant Koli also allegedly confessed to raping the corpses and eating human remains, but later retracted his statement. He has been sentenced to death for six other murder charges, and faces charges over nine further murders. Pandher is facing four more murder charges. The pair were sentenced to death in 2009 for the killing of a 14-year-old girl, however Pandher was cleared by a higher court months later. Six police officers were sacked in 2007 for negligence over their handling of the case, prompting India's federal bureau to take over the investigation.

Charlie suffers from a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. He also has brain damage. His parents said he is not expected to live to his first birthday on 4 August. Grant Armstrong, counsel for Charlie's parents, said their last wish was to be able to take their son home but that they had been led to believe that transfer across London was ""problematic"". ""We struggle with the difficulties the hospital is placing in the way of the parents having a... short period of time before the final act in Charlie's short life,"" Mr Armstrong told the court. He said that the parents and GOSH had disagreed about the timing and venue of where his death should take place. The judge deciding the case, Mr Justice Francis, said that part of the disagreement appeared to be over GOSH's view that a ventilator will not fit through the front door of the property to which Charlie's parents want to take him. The judge said it was for mediation to decide rather than him, but the lawyer for GOSH hospital said Charlie's parents had refused mediation. Katie Gollop QC, for GOSH, said the hospital would like to fulfill the parents' wishes if it was practical, saying it was essential that nothing should occur that could cause extra suffering to the youngster. Ms Gollop said: ""The care plan must be safe, it must spare Charlie all pain, it must protect his dignity, at the same time it must honour his parents' wishes about the time and place of his passing, and it has to balance Charlies interests and his parents' needs."" Her submission to the court said that the hospital believes that the intensive ventilation he requires to live can only be provided in a hospital setting and ""cannot be provided at his parents' home"". Mr Armstrong said representatives for GOSH had not visited the family home. The court adjourned to allow further discussions to take place between the hospital doctors and the family's representatives. :: Timeline of parents' battle to save Charlie The President of the Vatican's Bambino Gesu hospital - which had offered to help Charlie if it was possible - told a news conference on Tuesday afternoon that she completely backed the decisions of GOSH. Mariella Enoc said, after a request from Charlie's mother, one of the hospital's professors had examined Charlie and had agreed with the London hospital that nothing could be done. It comes after the lawyer for Charlie's parents told the High Court on Monday that they had made the decision to end their legal fight after reviewing the latest medical reports and scans from GOSH. Mr Armstrong said the experimental treatment no longer offers any chance of improving Charlie's condition. The High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in London had all ruled against Charlie's parents in recent months, with judges at the European Court of Human Rights refusing to intervene. GOSH had argued that the experimental therapy would not have helped improve Charlie's condition, and said the baby's life support treatment should end - allowing him to die peacefully and with dignity. It resulted in the case becoming a flashpoint for opposing views on health-care funding, medical intervention, the role of the state and the rights of the child after US-based pro-life activists flew to London to support Charlie's parents. The hospital said it would give ""careful thought"" on how the case was handled and how it can ""enrich the care it provides to its most vulnerable patients and families"". However, it said it hoped Professor Michio Hirano, the doctor who advised Ms Yates and Mr Gard on care in the US, would also ""find much upon which to reflect"". More follows..."

The Kia Oval has partnered with Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign to cut down on the amount of single-use plastic used at the London venue. ""By 2050 there is a chance there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish which is really scary for our world,"" Broad told Sky News. ""Sports grounds do waste a lot of plastic. We need to start making a change now."" In the UK, less than 50% of the plastic bottles that are thrown away get recycled. That contributes to the eight million tons of plastic waste that pours into the ocean every year. It never decomposes and will remain there forever. Last year, the Kia Oval introduced eco-friendly cups to replace disposable plastic pint glasses. Thursday's England versus South Africa clash will mark the 100th Test match at the ground. For spectators there will be a few changes. Twenty free water fountains and taps have been installed throughout the venue and 20,000 limited edition refillable bottles are available for fans. It's hoped this will encourage cricket-lovers to cut down on the amount of plastic bottles they buy, and then dispose of, at the venue. It's a small but significant move to try to reduce the amount of single-use plastic consumed across the five-day event. The Kia Oval's chief executive, Richard Gould, said: ""We're challenging our ticket holders to make simple behavioural changes that will have a dramatic impact on ocean health."" ""We hope by raising the issues with cricket fans we can work together to reduce the use of single-use plastics within our grounds."" Although it is small change for now, Kia Oval bosses hope that it will take just three years to make their ground a truly plastic-free place. :: You can find out more about the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign and how to get involved at www.skyoceanrescue.com"
2017-07-25,"A woman ""slapped"" the back of a Minneapolis police car shortly before an Australian was shot dead by an officer, records show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170726083012/http://news.sky.com/story/woman-slapped-police-car-before-justine-damond-was-shot-10960912,"Justine Damond, 40, was shot dead by Officer Mohamed Noor after she called to report a possible rape in the area on 15 July. It is still not clear what happened but a search warrant filed by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension provides new detail. It does not name the woman who slapped the car but says: ""After that, it is unknown to BCA agents what exactly happened but the female became deceased in the alley."" Mr Noor, who was the passenger in the police car, had shot across his partner in the driver's seat, hitting Ms Damond, a spiritual teacher who was engaged to be married. His partner has told officials he had been startled by a loud noise just before Ms Damond arrived at the vehicle. News of the warrant, which was obtained by Minnesota Public Radio, came hours after personnel records were released giving details about Mr Noor's training. Mr Noor was hired as a cadet in March 2015, becoming eligible to be a sworn officer six months later. He obtained a degree in economics and business administration before applying. While on the force, Mr Noor took a number of training courses and passed all his annual semi-automatic, handgun and shotgun qualifications. No awards or commendations are listed on his record and there are three complaints against him - one dismissed and two are pending. He has been on paid leave since the shooting. State officials are investigating possible criminal charges and he also faces an internal ""use of force"" investigation. Following the shooting he was described by police chief Janee Harteau as having completed training ""very well"" and being ""very suited to be on the street"". Ms Harteau has since resigned over the shooting."
2017-07-25,"To educate, to inform and entertain is the BBC's motto.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170726083012/http://news.sky.com/story/the-bbc-pay-gap-is-bad-its-class-gap-is-worse-10957166,"Well, after this week we're certainly better educated and informed about the salaries of its top on-screen personalities. Less entertaining, however, were some of the inequalities the list revealed: of the 96 names on the list of the BBC's mega earners, just under a third were women. Moreover the highest-paid woman was paid considerably less than the top male earners. Many absolute stars, like Emily Maitlis and Sarah Montague, failed to make the cut for doing much the same job as their male counterparts. Cue righteous and rightful anger from all sides, even from publications not exactly known as scions of feminism. :: Full list of BBC stars earning more than £150k Likewise many commentators were justly angry at the small number of ethnic minority presenters on the list - a mere 10. But in all the sound and the fury, one clarion call was mysteriously nowhere to be heard: a key piece of the puzzle which, in all of the lamentations over diversity, was time and again too poor to mention: class. Which is curious, because if we actually talked or even cared about this peculiar taboo, we might begin to see one of the reasons the gender and race pay gaps exist in the first place. I've been doing some research and number crunching. The list contains over 80 on-screen names. No fewer than 45% of the BBC's best paid stars went to private schools. That compares to 7% of the nation overall. Just think about that. If you send your child to private school it increases their chances of being one of the biggest names in TV and media by a factor of six. The gender pay gap may be too large but it's not nearly as big as the class pay gap for the people who never made it in the first place because of their background. The injustice is pretty overwhelming: after all, are we really saying that those who are lucky enough to be born into households which can afford to pay for private school fees are six times more talented? Six times better imbued with the skills required to be a successful BBC actor, sports presenter or journalist? And it's in journalism where the problem is most egregious. Three in five of the best-paid BBC on-air journalists and presenters went to independent schools. That means you're nine times more likely to be a top BBC journalist if you went to private school. If you're a working class girl, the odds are longer still. From Jeremy Vine to Mishal Husain from Sophie Raworth to Nick Robinson, the list is eye-wateringly long. Much attention was paid to the pay disparity on the Today programme, less to the fact that four of its five presenters went to private schools. Tellingly, even among many of those who did go to state schools, the vast majority went to grammars. It's possible to count the number of ""bog standard comprehensive"" working class boys and girls on one hand. In the 1810s it was said that the Battle of Waterloo was fought and won on the playing fields of Eton so dominant was the school in the top brass of the Army. In 2017, its equivalent is the six o'clock news. Allow me to declare an interest: I am a comprehensive school boy. I don't belittle for one moment my outstanding colleagues in TV or journalism who went to private school - they are all very talented people. Likewise, I'm a former proud practitioner at the BBC and would defend it to the end of the Earth. And it's quite unfair to single out the BBC in this regard anyway, I'm sure the pattern of private school dominance is repeated across our industry: at Sky, ITV and across Fleet Street. But I desperately want to see more state schoolers from working class backgrounds get into TV and media and I want to see us all try and do more about it. We might start on days like last Wednesday by actually talking about the problem at all. Because class matters in journalism even more than across the other areas covered on that list. We journalists are the ones who day after day, are supposed to reflect Britain unto itself. We're supposed to be the ones who find and tell the stories that matter to our audiences, and for the BBC, all of its licence fee payers. How are we supposed to do that if we are drawn from an increasingly narrow social caste? Maybe, just maybe, if we had more kids in journalism who grew up in tower blocks, we'd have been better at shining a light on the living conditions of some of our fellow citizens, like those who lived and died in Grenfell Tower. Or we would be less disposed to the curse of group think which has led journalists to call it wrong time after time in recent years, whether it be Corbyn, Trump or Brexit. And that's why it matters who is making editorial judgements off screen too. The BBC also published the number of its senior managers who earn more than £150,000 too, to considerably less fanfare. It is again dominated by those sporting the (literally) golden ticket of a private school education: James Purnell the director of radio; James Harding, the director of news; the editors of the flagships Newsnight and Today, Ian Katz and Sarah Sands. Maybe the fact that the top echelons of the media are dominated by private schoolers explains some of the gender and BAME pay gaps. If you go to private school you're more likely to hire other people like you, other private schoolers, who are less likely to be from an ethnic minority background. Open the talent pool up to more talented, ambitious state school educated girls and they might look a lot more kindly on the pay of their female on-screen colleagues vis-a-vis their male counterparts. It's no secret that it's hard to get into journalism and the media. Unpaid internships and an expensive postgraduate degree from City university (£9,000 a year) are almost as obligatory as passports at the border these days. Not to mention the fact that virtually all opportunities are concentrated in London. None of this is the fault of any of the people on that list nor any one person in management of any organisation. But I do think, frankly, that many senior BBC managers and others from across the media's boss class generally care about class diversity much less because it's less tangible than sex or race. Easier to point to new women or BAME hires, less easy and less headline grabbing to talk about class, which is, after all a more fluid concept yet connected intrinsically to both. But just because it's harder and less 'zeitgeisty' doesn't mean it's not important and we should start to recognise that diversity in our society is more than just about your sex or gender. It's a complicated, tightly woven tapestry and your background and class, for which your educational background is a pretty decent indicator, is crucial. Is a poor working class man from Scunthorpe less diverse than a wealthy ethnic minority woman from Hampstead who went to one of the country's top private schools? I think they both have something to say and we need as many different voices as we can in the makeup of our media. As welcome as it would be, the injustice of inequality won't be righted simply by having equal numbers of men and women on screen even if they're on the same pay. The work will only have just begun. Diversity is about more than what you can see."

Campaigners said it was a ""shocking and ignorant attack"" on transgender troops. The leader's controversial move reverses plans put in place by Barack Obama's administration to begin accepting transgender recruits, with transgender people expected to start enlisting this year. Mr Obama's defence secretary Ash Carter ended a ban on transgender people being able to serve openly in the military in June 2016. An estimated 2,500 to 7,000 transgender people are already on active duty, with another 1,500 to 4,000 in America's military reserves. After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... ....Transgender individuals to  serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming..... ....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you Since October, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and begin formally changing their gender. Up to 250 service members are believed to be in the process of transitioning to their preferred genders or been approved to formally change gender. Mr Trump did not explain what would happen to those existing transgender people in the military, with those affected urged to contact lawyers by LGBT rights groups. The Pentagon referred all questions about the President's announcement to the White House and said it would provide revised guidance to the US military ""in the near future"". ""We will continue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the Commander-in-Chief on transgender individuals serving the military,"" said Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis. Revealing the move on Twitter, Mr Trump posted: ""After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.""

2017-07-26,Mike Ashley has won a High Court battle against an investment banker who claimed he was owed £14m by the Sports Direct boss.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/sports-direct-boss-mike-ashley-wins-high-court-fight-over-15m-deal-10962282,"Jeff Blue had alleged the tycoon made a business pact with him at a pub. He said Mr Ashley sometimes did business ""in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues"". The banker said he had been promised £15m if he used his expertise to increase Sports Direct's share price to £8, but had only received £1m. Mr Ashley had called Mr Blue a liar - dismissing the suggestion that he made big business decisions in pubs as ""total crap"" - and said the money paid to the banker was a bonus for previous work. The Newcastle United FC owner was not in court to hear the judge deliver his ruling on Wednesday, but his lawyers said he had won a ""comprehensive"" victory. The case had centred on a conversation said to have taken place between Mr Blue and Mr Ashley during a night of heavy drinking at central London pub the Horse & Groom in 2013. The court heard colourful evidence from Mr Blue, who said Mr Ashley would take naps in meetings and hold drink-fuelled management sessions - one of which culminated in him vomiting into a fireplace. ""I can't remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking,"" Mr Ashley had told the court proceedings. ""I do remember that we had a lot of drinks and a lot of banter. ""If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him £15m if he could increase (Sports Direct's) share price to £8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn't being serious."" He said he was not ""Obi-Wan Kenobi running the Death Star"", giving evidence over the claim against him. Mr Justice Leggatt ruled in favour of the tycoon, saying no one would have thought what was said in the pub was ""serious"". He said: ""The Sports Direct senior management meetings certainly show that Mr Ashley is happy to combine discussion of business matters with the consumption of alcohol. ""But there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Ashley has ever negotiated or concluded a contract at one of these meetings."" He told lawyers at the end of proceedings that the case had been ""a lot more interesting than some"". The judge said Mr Blue would have to pick up Mr Ashley's legal bills of £1.5m. In a statement following the ruling, Mr Ashley said: ""The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded £8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct."""

The FCO said it had now withdrawn the advice for the capital and major tourist resorts. But it continued to caution against ""all travel"" and ""all but essential travel"" to some areas of the country, including those nearer the Libyan border. The revision means UK tour operators can resume selling holidays in Tunisia for the first time since the Sousse attack. ""This update reflects our latest assessment that the risk to British nationals in Tunisia has changed,"" said Alistair Burt, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa. ""This is in part due to the security improvements that the Tunisian authorities and tourist industry have made since the tragic terrorist attacks in 2015, with support from the UK and international partners."" The FCO said it has kept its assessment of the risks of British nationals travelling to Tunisia ""under constant review"" since the Sousse attack. ""Whilst we are changing advice against all but essential travel in most of Tunisia, there remain real risks for British nationals and I recommend people read our travel advice before planning their travel,"" said Mr Burt. In 2014, some 440,000 people from the UK visited Tunisia, according to the Office for National Statistics. Demand also went up the year before the Sousse attack. The Islamic State terror group said it was behind Seifeddine Rezgui's attack. Travel industry operators welcomed the change of travel advice and said they would assess if and how to resume services in the country. A Thomas Cook spokesman said it was ""pleased that the Foreign Office has taken this decision to open Tunisia back up to Brits"". It said it would assess ""how and when we put this once-popular destination back on sale"".

The lender said on Thursday that it had also put aside extra cash to address the mis-selling of payment protection insurance to reflect current claim volumes, reinforcing its status as by far the worst-exposed lender to the PPI scandal. It comes just four months after the bank announced a £350m writedown to cover the mounting bill, which has now reached more than £18bn. The mortgage redress scheme is understood to centre on the way Lloyds applied policies relating to financial difficulty assessments, leading to some customers being charged in error between 2009 and 2016. Nevertheless, Lloyds' half-year results reflected a continuing strong performance by the underlying business, despite the continuing spectre of ultra-low interest rates. It reported pre-tax profits of £2.5bn in the first six months of 2017 - up 4% on the same period last year. This includes the additional PPI provisions which are set to cover around 9,000 claims per week through to the deadline set at the end of August 2019. Total income also increased by 4% to £9.3bn in the six months to 30 June. These are its first set of results since the Government sold its last remaining stake in Lloyds Banking Group in May, returning the lender entirely to private ownership. Lloyds has since resumed dividend payments, and underlined its renewed confidence last year with a deal to acquire MBNA, the giant credit card business. CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio said: ""We have delivered another strong set of results with increased underlying and statutory profit and strong capital generation, whilst completing the acquisition of MBNA and returning to full private ownership. ""Our differentiated UK focused business model continues to deliver, with our cost leadership and lower risk positioning providing competitive advantage."" In addition to its vast PPI bill, Lloyds has set aside £100m to deal with the fallout from a fraud at the Reading branch of HBOS, which has seen six people jailed and compensation claims. Victims of the fraud included Noel Edmonds, the television presenter, who this week increased his compensation claim against the bank to £300m."

The study will be carried out by the Migration Advisory Committee, a quango that advises the Government on immigration issues, which will report by September next year. In a letter to the committee's chairman, Professor Alan Manning, Ms Rudd said the Government continues ""working towards the goal of achieving sustainable levels of net migration"". And the Home Secretary said that under Brexit ""we will be able to apply different immigration rules and requirements according to the UK's economic and social needs"". She said: ""Leaving the European Union gives us the opportunity to take control of immigration from the EU. ""We will ensure we continue to attract those who benefit us economically, socially and culturally. ""But, at the same time, our new immigration system will give us control of the volume of people coming here - giving the public confidence we are applying our own rules on who we want to come to the UK and helping us to bring down net migration to sustainable levels. ""The study I am asking the Migration Advisory Committee to complete is a major step in ensuring we create a system that works in the best interests of the country."" The Immigration Minister, Brandon Lewis, added: ""We want to build a system where we have control of our borders and which delivers for our industries and our economy."" Responding to concerns from business, the Home Secretary also said there will be an implementation period when the UK leaves the EU to ensure there is no ""cliff edge"" for employers or EU nationals in the UK. But the study has been dismissed as too little, too late by political opponents, who claim it should have been ordered immediately after the EU referendum last year. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: ""The Government needs to explain why this study wasn't commissioned a year ago, directly after the referendum. ""The NHS, businesses and universities that depend on European citizens need answers now, not in another 14 months' time."""

She was a superstar in the making"". Fighting back tears, he said: ""To become something in life you have to have that spark, that charisma. The ones that make it are born with it… and Saffie had that. ""All she asked of us was to love her, to reassure her that we were there for her, to let her go off and do what she wanted to do."" Dozens of mourners carrying a single red rose - at the request of the family - arrived to celebrate her life and say goodbye to the eight-year-old. They were handed a card showing a smiling photo of the young girl, with the message: ""We would like to thank you for being here today with us and for all your love & support. The Roussos family."" They invited anyone affected by the attack in Manchester to attend and a steady stream of people began arriving at the cathedral from mid-morning onwards. Saffie, from Leyland, near Preston, was killed as she left the arena after an Ariana Grande concert in May, having been given the tickets by her parents for Christmas. She died from multiple injuries. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi's home-made device was packed with nuts and bolts and killed 22 people, seven of them under 18. Her mother, Lisa Roussos, 48, who is still receiving treatment for her injuries, arrived at the service with her arm in a sling. She was accompanied by Saffie's stepsister, Ashlee Bromwich, who was also wounded. In Tarleton, the village where Saffie and her brother went to school, people tied pink balloons to gate posts and lamp posts as a mark of remembrance. A short service will also be held in the local church later. The family have published a montage of photographs of Saffie, set to Ariana Grande's hit One Last Time. The montage was also played at the service. The YouTube video shows family pictures, including Saffie playing with her brother Xander, and the little girl on holiday with her parents, wearing make-up and dressing up. Saffie's friends hope the video will be liked and shared using the hashtag #Saffiethesuperstar to fulfil her dream of becoming a YouTube star."
2017-07-26,A new blood test that can detect changes to tumour DNA could lead to life-extending treatments for women with late stage breast cancer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/new-tests-offer-personalised-treatment-for-late-stage-breast-cancer-patients-10963418,"Although the advancement is still in its earliest stages, scientists hope it could allow doctors to create personalised treatments for women based on the particular development of their illness. The test detects changes in genes linked to the the development of the disease, allowing doctors to precisely tailor each patient's treatment. If the test finds mutations to a patient's HER2 gene, for example, it could target it with the drug Herceptin, while changes to the oestrogen receptor ESR1 gene might prompt a patient to be recommended other treatments like chemotherapy. Dr David Guttery, from the University of Leicester, described the blood test as ""novel"", and able to detect mutations ""integral in driving the growth of breast cancer"". ""By analysing blood plasma to measure for cancer-specific changes to key breast cancer genes… we hope this test could help doctors and patients choose the best treatment at the best time,"" he explained. The technology is a breakthrough because it allows a single test to analyse two kinds of DNA mutations: somatic ""point"" mutations which occur when DNA molecules are shuffled in the wrong order, and copy number alterations involving extra copies of genes producing too much protein. Dr Justine Alford, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said that the advancements could help patients in the later stages of breast cancer,an area that has seen slow progress even as survival rates for early-detected cancers have improved. ""The researchers may have developed a way to track breast cancer as it grows, allowing doctors to act swiftly and give patients the treatments that are right for them as early as possible,"" she said. The research was funded by Breast Cancer Now and Cancer Research UK."
2017-07-26,"Charlie Gard's parents have until noon today to come to an arrangement with their son's doctors over his care, or else he will be taken to a hospice to die.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/charlie-gard-noon-deadline-for-deciding-where-baby-dies-10962991,"Connie Yates and Chris Gard had asked the High Court for permission to take him home, before agreeing on Wednesday that he could be cared for at a hospice. Lawyer Grant Armstrong, representing Charlie's parents, indicated that the couple wanted to privately fund treatment at a hospice, where the 11-month-old would stay on life support for a number of days. However, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) bosses said Charlie should stay at a hospice for a shorter period and expressed doubt over the proposed care arrangements. A hospital representative described the parents' plans as not ""in any way viable"". Mr Justice Francis ruled that unless the parents and GOSH come to an agreement by noon today, Charlie will be taken to a hospice and life support treatment will end soon after. After the judge made his decision, Ms Yates left the court crying and said: ""I hope you are happy with yourselves"". During the hearing, Mr Armstrong said nurses from GOSH had volunteered to look after Charlie in his final days. He expressed confidence that a transfer to a hospice could take place while meeting Charlie's nursing requirements. But GOSH said a paediatric intensive care unit specialist would be required to care for the child at a hospice over a longer period. The latest legal row began when the hospital said it was not practical to get the equipment the child needs into the family home, as his ventilator is unable to fit through the front door. In reply, Mr Armstrong accused GOSH of putting ""obstacle after obstacle"" in the way of Charlie's parents, who had promised their son ""every day"" that he would eventually be taken home. ""It seems really upsetting after everything we've been through to deny us this,"" Ms Yates had said. Later, Ms Yates broke down in court and shouted: ""What if it was your child?"" Charlie suffers from a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness, and he also has brain damage. He requires invasive ventilation to breathe and cannot see, hear or swallow. Following the hearing, Charlie's godfather James Evers accused GOSH of putting ""arduous conditions"" in the way of Ms Yates and Mr Gard's wishes. He said: ""We know (Charlie) is not in pain and suffering, so to set the bar so high that he needs this specialist with him 24/7 is setting a massive hurdle that is totally unnecessary. ""It's the nurses that look after him 24 hours a day so really that should be enough."""
2017-07-26,The Government will stop charging employment tribunal fees and refund those who have already paid them - after the Supreme Court found they were unlawful.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/employment-tribunal-fees-unlawful-court-rules-10962273,"The court ruled unanimously against the Government and found it was acting unconstitutionally when it introduced the fees - which can be up to £1,200. Unison waged a four-year legal battle to get the fees scrapped, arguing they prevented workers from seeking justice and were discriminatory toward women. The public sector union says the ruling means the Government will have to refund more than £27m to the thousands of people charged for taking unfair dismissal claims to tribunal. The fees were introduced in July 2013 by Chris Grayling, then the lord chancellor, in a bid to reduce costs and free up clogged up courts. A review of the impact of the fees conducted this year showed there had been a 70% drop in the number of cases brought in the employment tribunal since they were first introduced. After the ruling, justice minister Dominic Raab said: ""The Supreme Court recognised the important role fees can play, but ruled that we have not struck the right balance in this case. ""We will take immediate steps to stop charging fees in employment tribunals and put in place arrangements to refund those who have paid."" Unison general secretary Dave Prentis declared the ruling a ""major victory"" for workers. ""The Government is not above the law, but when ministers introduced fees they were disregarding laws many centuries old, and showing little concern for employees seeking justice following illegal treatment at work,"" he said. ""Unison took the case on behalf of anyone who's ever been wronged at work, or who might be in future. ""Unscrupulous employers no longer have the upper hand."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the fees had been a ""bonanza for bad bosses"" as they gave them ""free rein to mistreat staff"". Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, described it as a ""landmark ruling"", adding: ""Employment Tribunal fees have prevented people from getting justice when they've been treated unfairly at work."" David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which provided independent legal opinion during the case, called the Supreme Court ruling a ""damning verdict on the current regime"". ""The right to justice must be based on the merit of your case, not your ability to pay. Thousands may have been denied of this right and priced out of getting justice,"" he said. ""Women face a double penalty with high fees and short time scales to bring maternity discrimination cases."""
2017-07-26,The Mediterranean - Europe's summer playground -  is being trashed by accumulating plastic waste.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/turtles-in-the-mediterranean-threatened-by-plastic-tide-10963406,"Research suggests 3000 tonnes of the material is floating on the surface, with more added every year. And because the Sea is almost fully enclosed the plastic is trapped, taking decades to break down. Not only are tourists swimming in the debris, marine creatures are mistaking it for food. Scientists at the Society for the Protection of Turtles in Northern Cyprus are watching the plastic tide with alarm. Postmortems on dead turtles have identified fragments inside their stomachs. Robin Snape, project coordinator for the group, said: ""In the green turtle it's really common. The vast majority of them have some plastic in their gastro-intestinal tract. It's more than 90%."" The conservationists took us to a bay on the Karpaz Peninsula, close to one of the most important nesting beaches for the endangered green turtle. We saw plastic packaging, straws and sheeting piled into large drifts along the high tide line. Labels suggested some of the plastic had been swept by the wind and current from as far away as Turkey, Lebanon and North Africa. :: Documentary: Plastic pollution in our oceans Tierney Chalmers, a student volunteer at the Society, has been helping monitor plastic on the beach. She said: ""Jellyfish look like plastic bags, bottle tops can look like crustaceans. ""It's awful because it means turtles and other animals eat it and it's passed down the food chain."" Tests are being carried out on dead turtles for any toxic chemicals that could accumulate in body tissues. It's an added potential threat to a population that already has a high mortality rate from fishing nets. So many turtles around Cyprus become entangled and drown that few survive to adulthood. Münur Hasimoglu, who has fished off the northern coast for 40 years, said he catches 3-4 turtles a month by accident. Not all die. ""I feel sorry,"" he said. ""It's a species that has really declined. But there is little we can do about it."" Conservationists are attempting to compensate for the deaths by protecting nesting sites. Dogs and foxes dig up freshly laid eggs, sometimes eating a clutch of 100 or more. But by putting wire mesh over the nest, the eggs are protected so more turtles hatch and reach the sea. As a result the local population of green turtles is beginning to increase. But the plastic in the sea has unknown consequences for the turtles. And that's a problem the project volunteers can't solve on their own."
2017-07-26,"Lloyds Banking Group is to repay nearly £300m to about 600,000 customers over failings in the way it applied mortgage arrears policies, in the latest scandal to hit the UK’s biggest high street lender.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/lloyds-to-repay-300m-to-customers-over-mortgage-arrears-errors-10963057,"Sky News has learnt that Lloyds will unveil a customer contact and remediation programme on Thursday alongside half-year results that will also be blighted by a bigger-than-expected provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI). Sources said that the redress scheme would cost Lloyds just under £300m, with more than £50m also set aside to cover administrative costs. The issue is understood to centre on the way Lloyds applied policies relating to financial difficulty assessments, leading to some customers being charged in error between 2009 and 2016. One insider said that affected customers, who will receive an average of £350 in repaid fees and interest, would be contacted proactively by Lloyds and that they needed to take no action themselves. The vast majority of the bill has already been provided for in previous results announcements, but one insider said Lloyds would have to top up its provisions by tens of millions of pounds on Thursday. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is investigating Lloyds over its treatment of customers in mortgage arrears, is understood to have been consulted on the bank's plan. The existence of an enforcement probe by the City watchdog was revealed last year and reiterated in Lloyds' latest annual report, published in February, which said: ""On 26 May 2016, the Group was informed that an enforcement team at the FCA had commenced an investigation in connection with the group's mortgage arrears handling activities. ""This investigation is ongoing and it is currently not possible to make a reliable assessment of the liability, if any, that may result from the investigation."" The progress of the FCA inquiry is unclear, although it could see Lloyds being hit with a hefty fine if it concludes that customers were treated unfairly. While not all customers were treated inconsistently, the bank is said to have decided to repay every customer who fell behind with their mortgage repayments during the relevant period. The fact that the errors were taking place over such a protracted period and until relatively recently could have consequences for the bonuses of senior managers, according to one City pay consultant. The mortgage arrears remediation programme is the latest in a string of conduct failings to hit Lloyds, which has already had to set aside more than £17bn for PPI mis-selling claims. People close to the bank said it was likely to have to add well over £500m to that bill on Thursday, reinforcing its status as by far the worst-exposed lender to the PPI scandal. Nevertheless, Lloyds' half-year results are expected to reflect a continuing strong performance by the underlying business, despite the continuing spectre of ultra-low interest rates. In May, the Government sold the last of a shareholding in Lloyds that had once stood at 43%, with Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, hailing a modest profit for UK taxpayers. The disposal represented a milestone in Britain's efforts to shed the toxic legacy of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks including Lloyds were bailed out with tens of billions of pounds in capital injections - and even larger sums in behind-the-scenes central bank support. Lloyds has since resumed dividend payments, and underlined its renewed confidence last year with a deal to acquire MBNA, the giant credit card business. The sale of the Government's remaining stake also triggered speculation about the future of Antonio Horta-Osorio, Lloyds' chief executive. He has been linked with the looming vacancy at the top of HSBC Holdings, where Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, has said he will step down in 2018. Mr Horta-Osorio has, however, said that he has no plans to leave, and appeared to quash rumours about his departure earlier this month by unveiling a shake-up of the bank's senior ranks. The reorganisation came months before his next three-year strategy update, which he is due to announce towards the end of the year. Thursday's half-year results are likely to offer further endorsement of his strategy, although they will also provide a stark reminder of some of the conduct issues which have haunted the industry in recent years. In addition to its vast PPI bill, Lloyds has set aside £100m to deal with the fallout from a fraud at the Reading branch of HBOS, which has seen six people jailed and compensation claims Victims of the fraud included Noel Edmonds, the television presenter, who this week increased his compensation claim against the bank to £300m. Lloyds merged with the stricken HBOS - then the UK's biggest mortgage lender - but the deal initially proved to be disastrous because of the scale of bad loans on the combined group's balance sheet. The bank declined to comment on Wednesday."

The new blaze, in the middle of the holiday season, is raging near Bormes-les-Mimosas, southwest of the popular resort Saint-Tropez on the Mediterranean coast. The fire broke out just before 11pm on Tuesday and burned 800 hectares of forest by Wednesday morning, with 540 firefighters sent to tackle the blaze. Around 3,000 campers were among those evacuated from La Londe, La Lavandou and Borme-les-Mimosas. Visiting the scene on Wednesday night, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said: ""The situation remains difficult, I must say it. ""Like me, you feel the wind is blowing."" Among those evacuated were British holidaymakers at the Camp du Domaine campsite in Bormes-les-Mimosas. All 1,000 camping plots across the site were evacuated, according to Oliver Williams, a deputy head teacher from Redhill, Surrey, who is staying at the resort with his family. He told Sky News: ""My wife woke me up about two o'clock this morning, saying she'd heard the car alarms and people shouting 'allez, allez'. ""They were chucking everything in the back of a car and trying to get out. That was all a bit surreal and it took a moment to really sink in."" Mr Williams' family headed to the campsite's private beach, where many of those evacuated, including French, German and Dutch tourists, had gathered. ""We stayed from about 2am until about 7am and then we were thinking we could probably make our way back to the plot,"" he said. ""But we were told we weren't allowed to go back because the Canadairs were about to fly over and drop water on to the fire. ""That's mixed with some chemicals so they keep people well back."" Mr Williams praised French firefighters for their ""absolutely amazing job"" in tackling the multiple blazes in the area. Fellow Briton Lisa Minot, The Sun's travel editor, is also staying at the resort - where the campsite's sprinkler system was being used in an attempt to stop the blaze jumping across from the hills. She said: ""Everybody was told to evacuate to the beach and they're still there and they have not allowed us to go back to our caravan. ""It's utter chaos, there are no provisions or anything else... there's no one telling us what to do."" Local tourist site Fort de Bregancon, the former official retreat of French presidents, has been shut due to the fire. Amid other blazes burning through the region, people were pictured on the beach at La Croix-Valmer near Saint-Tropez watching as firefighting aircraft dropped water on a raging forest fire. Officials said that blaze had been contained on Tuesday, with the local mayor describing a ""disaster area"" that had been left by the flames. In Corsica, residents spoke of ""apocalyptic"" scenes after a blaze engulfed 1,800 hectares of forest, burning several vehicles and threatening homes. In Carros, north of Nice on the mainland, locals described waking up to a ""lunar landscape"" after a fire. More than 4,000 firefighters and troops have been deployed in total, along with 19 water bomber planes, since the fires broke out in France on Monday. ATTENTION , en raison des incendies  sur #Bormeslesmimosas Le Fort de Brégançon sera donc fermé au public aujourd'hui, mercredi 26 juillet. pic.twitter.com/uIbaHExTTj Six more of the planes have been ordered by the French government while extra firefighters have been drafted in from the north of the country. At least 12 firefighters have been injured and 15 police officers affected by smoke inhalation. France has asked the EU for help as it deals with the fires, with two firefighting planes sent by Italy. Italy and Portugal are also dealing with fires - Portugal has 2,300 firefighters battling 13 blazes, while in Italy firefighters have responded to 26 requests in the country's central and southern areas."

Re-living their ordeal, which was caught on CCTV, the victim's wife described how she tried to protect her husband. She said: ""I saw the boy with the gun and my attention was directly on him. I tried to create a barrier between the gunmen and my husband. So effectively I was staring down the face of a gun. ""I really felt at that moment in time that I either put up a fight or we're both going to be leaving here in body bags. The intention was to rob my husband and I of my jewellery. ""He ripped my Rolex watch off of my wrist. The next thing I just heard a gunshot and in what was probably seconds to me felt like a lifetime of waiting."" The couple fought off the robbers, pushing the raiders down the stairs, but Hinds shot the husband in the leg and stomach and once more as he lay injured in the road. He suffered a fractured leg and multiple bowel injuries but has since been discharged from hospital. His wife's watch was stolen but she was unhurt. Hinds, 31, who was found guilty of attempted murder, robbery and firearms offences at the Old Bailey in June, has been sentenced to 32 years. Sterling, 33, who had pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of a firearm, but was acquitted of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, was jailed for 11 and a half years. Hinds was arrested the following day, while Sterling was held soon after, found to be suffering from a gunshot wound to his elbow believed to have been sustained in the attack, for which he had not sought hospital treatment. The men were placed together before and after the attack by a combination of CCTV, witness statements and phone evidence, while Sterling was linked to it by blood-stained clothing and DNA taken from a phone. Praising the woman's bravery, Detective Sergeant Nick Hamer said: ""I would like to give special acknowledgement to the victim's wife who courageously fought off the attackers and attempted to get between them and her husband. ""If it had not been for her actions, it is highly likely that more shots would have been fired at her husband, and the outcome could have been worse."""

The services sector's brighter performance was largely driven by the film and retail industries. Hotels, restaurants and distribution expanded by 1.1% over the period - adding 0.15 percentage points to GDP growth. Motion pictures were the second biggest contributor to the services sector's growth - up 8.2% and boosting GDP by 0.07 percentage points. But the economy was held back by slides of 0.9% in construction and 0.5% in manufacturing. :: Not much Chancellor can do about Brexit uncertainty Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the figures represented the worst start to the first half of a year since 2012 - and ""expose the last seven years of Tory economic failure"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable warned that only the spending of shoppers had kept the economy moving at a ""modest"" pace. He added ministers' insistence on ""an extreme Brexit"" was ""creating uncertainty and reducing investment"". But Chancellor Philip Hammond defended the Government's record: ""Our economy has grown continuously for four and a half years, delivering record levels of employment. ""We can be proud of that; but we are not complacent. We need to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards for people across the country,"" he added. Britain's economy performed better than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote last year but accelerating price rises - partly driven by the sharp fall in the pound since the vote - now appear to be taking their toll. Wages fell by 0.2% in the first three months of 2017, the first time there has been a decline for two and a half years. Sky's Economics Editor Ed Conway said: ""One of the warnings and one of the risks we heard from some economists in the run up to the referendum was that there was likely to be a recession if the UK voted to leave. ""That clearly hasn't happened and we are now a year on from that, and every quarter has been positive growth. ""But when you look at the numbers here... there is some cause for concern, and also some question marks as to whether this is indeed down to concerns that both households and business are facing over Brexit."" ""Households are feeling squeezed at the moment - inflation is relatively high at the moment and wages still low - and businesses are still unsure about what kind of arrangement we are going to have with the EU, or indeed the rest of the world, over the course of the next few years."""
2017-07-26,A former chef already serving a life sentence for the brutal rape and murder of Sally Anne Bowman has admitted attacks on two other women.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/sally-anne-bowman-killer-mark-dixie-admits-another-rape-13-years-before-10962306,"Mark Dixie, 46, was jailed for 34 years in 2008 for repeatedly stabbing teenage model Miss Bowman before raping her as she lay dead or dying in Croydon, south London, in September 2005. He denied killing the blonde 18-year-old at the time of his trial, but has now confessed to both her murder and previous assaults. On Wednesday, the killer pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court, south London, to raping another woman 13 years before Miss Bowman's death, as well as attacking a further victim in 2002. Both previous attacks also took place in Croydon. Appearing via videolink from HMP Frankland in County Durham, the former pub worker, who lived in Australia from 1993 to 1999, appeared calm as he confessed to ambushing a woman in an isolated car park in 1987. After raping her, Dixie tied the woman to her car and set fire to it, but she managed to escape. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the court: ""He actually raped her in her car and after he had attacked her and she had asked him to let her go, he said: 'I can't, you will go to police.' ""He used a silk tie from her blouse to tie her by her wrists, made her lie on the back seat of the car and tied her feet with the seat belt. ""He then set fire to the front seat of the car. He later told police he had set fire to a Tampax."" The sex attacker admitted charges of indecent assault and grievous bodily harm (GBH) after he hit the second woman over the head with a chef's steel - used to sharpen knives - before molesting her on a flight of stairs in 2002. Dixie had described the crime to police after being linked to the 1987 attack by a fingerprint. He told officers: ""I will give you another one as well,"" Mr Aylett revealed to the court. Dixie threatened to kill the woman after hitting her on the head several times and fled the scene following the attack, after being confronted by someone living close by. Mr Aylett told the court how Dixie admitted Miss Bowman's murder to police in January 2015, nearly 10 years after her death. ""He wrote to police indicating he wanted to tell them the truth of what had happened to Sally Anne, because at the trial he said that he was not responsible for her murder,"" Mr Aylett said. ""He also admitted two other serious attacks on women that had taken place some time before."" Miss Bowman, who was also a singer, attended the BRIT School - subsequently made famous by stars such as Adele and Amy Winehouse - and had been compared to Kate Moss in her fledgling modelling career. She was subject to a frenzied early hours attack by Dixie, including biting, just minutes after she had left her boyfriend following a row in a car. The killer initially denied murder, claiming he had sex with Miss Bowman after finding her on the ground, not knowing she was dead or dying. Dixie had a string of previous convictions before being jailed for Miss Bowman's murder. He will be sentenced over the 1987 and 2002 attacks in September."

He decided to give up his job as a pilot so he could focus on full time Royal duties. Writing in the Eastern Daily Press newspaper, he said: ""As I arrive for work at East Anglian Air Ambulance this evening, my last shift with this incredible team, I wanted to say thank you to my colleagues, team mates and the people of East Anglia who I have been so proud to serve. ""As I hang up my flight suit, I am proud to have served with such an incredible team of people, who save lives across the region every day."" Describing his experiences as an air ambulance pilot he said: ""Over the past two years I have met people from across the region who were in the most desperate of circumstances. As part of the team, I have been invited into people's homes to share moments of extreme emotion, from relief that we have given someone a fighting chance, to profound grief. ""I have watched as incredibly skilled doctors and paramedics have saved people's lives. These experiences have instilled in me a profound respect for the men and women who serve in our emergency services, which I hope to continue to champion even as I leave the profession. ""I am hugely grateful for having had this experience."" In the article he also thanks his workmates for treating him as just another member of the team, and not as a member of the Royal Family. He writes: ""From the moment I joined, when that phone rang at the base for the first time, it was clear that I was a fellow professional, a pilot with a job to do - in such a team there can be no other option, but still I am grateful to my colleagues for accepting me so readily."" He also goes on to describe in detail a couple of incidents he responded to. ""As a team, we travel to some very daunting incidents and we have been though some incredibly tough times together, witnessing some appalling tragedies,"" he wrote. ""One of the first call outs I made was to a young man who had committed suicide; it was an incredibly tough day and had a profound effect on all of us, not least in my determination now to draw attention to this issue. ""Another rescue that sticks in my mind was to a young man who was involved in a road accident. His uncle in the car with him sadly didn't survive, and I was sure that from what we were faced with he wouldn't either - but thanks to the skills of our medical team he is alive today. ""We were first on scene and in such circumstances we all had to pitch in to fight to save the young man's life. It is days like this, when you know you have made a difference, that give you the determination to keep going."" The Duke joined EAAA in March 2015 and after completing his final training flew his first operational missions in July 2015. Since then he's been based out of Cambridge Airport, responding to emergency call outs across Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. In a statement Patrick Peal, Chief Executive of the EAAA said: ""As one would expect, there has been a lot of excitement surrounding William and his work with the charity. ""To us, he has simply been another hardworking member of the team; one of 11 highly respected pilots who help us to save hundreds of lives each year. ""We can't thank William enough for his hard work and commitment to the charity during this time. He has been a true professional, delivering our doctors and critical care paramedics to patients under testing conditions. His dedication to the job, and wonderful character will be greatly missed, and i know I speak for all our staff when i say we wish him the very best of luck for the future."" As second in line to the throne, William won't need a job reference for the next stage in his working life. From September the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will primarily be based in London at Kensington Palace, as Prince George starts school, and William and Kate commit all of their time to full time Royal duties."

That followed falls in the previous two months - blamed on the timing of Easter and readying production for new models. It reported on Thursday that June's reduction meant total output in the first half of the year was down almost 3%. It was, the SMMT said, largely expected following a period of strong sales growth aided by the availability of cheap car finance. But the industry body pointed to a drop of almost 10% in domestic demand, as consumers face higher Brexit-linked cost pressures. :: New petrol and diesel cars banned from 2040 Exports, it said, were still driving production with the number of UK-made cars being shipped overseas hitting a five-year high in percentage terms. The SMMT highlighted growth in uncertainty among carmakers. It has campaigned vigorously for tariff-free trade after the UK leaves the EU, fearing manufacturers will drive off for the continent if the UK's largest export market is more competitive. It said that while factory output was predicted to pick up in the second half of the year as new models came on line, this was now less certain. It also pointed to the findings of a report for the industry which predicted targets for 2020 would now fall shy of estimates, though each scenario included the expectation of trade tariffs. The downbeat note was issued just days after some welcome news, with BMW confirming plans to build electric Minis at its Cowley plant outside Oxford from 2019 - the year the UK is slated to leave the EU. The Government and the company insisted there were no sweetheart deals to secure the investment. SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said clarity for all was now needed after a ""turbulent"" year for the sector. He said: ""World-class engineering, productivity, strong government collaboration and massive investment in the past few years have helped UK automotive become a global success story. ""At the heart of this has been the free and frictionless trade we've enjoyed with the EU, by far our biggest customer and supplier, but Brexit uncertainty is not helping investment and growth is stalling. ""The Government has been in 'listening' mode but now it must put on the table the concrete plans that will assure the future competitiveness of the sector. ""Investors need certainty so, at the very least, the UK must seek an interim deal which maintains single market and customs union membership until we have in place the complex new agreement sought with the EU."" A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: ""The UK's automotive industry is world leading and the Government's Industrial Strategy makes clear that we want to build on our strengths in advanced manufacturing in this sector. ""Nissan's decision to continue its investment in Sunderland and plans by Jaguar Land Rover to double its output here are clear votes of confidence in our automotive industry. ""We are determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive locations in the world for investment in automotive manufacturing.""​"

Sky plc said that ‎revenue during the year had risen by 10% on a constant currency basis to £12.9bn as it continued to expand its range of products across the handful of countries in which it operates. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell by 3% to £2.14bn. The company, which offers pay-television, broadband, and home and mobile telecoms services, added nearly 700,000 new customers and close to 2.6 million products during the financial year. Sky's chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, described the performance as ""strong"" despite ""market headwinds"". He added‎ that the £97m fall in operating profit was ""excellent"" in the context of an additional £629m of Premier League rights costs. Looking ahead, Mr Darroch said the media group would be increasing its investment in original programming by 25% during the year. Sky, which broadcasts series such as Riviera and The Affair as well as its extensive sports offering, plans to export a customer loyalty programme used in Italy to its other markets, including the UK. The company said it hoped that this would help to reduce customer churn, which it acknowledged was ""at a level higher than we would like"". ""Despite the broader consumer environment remaining uncertain, we are confident of delivering on the plans we've laid out as we continue to give our customers the best content, great products and industry-leading service,"" said Mr Darroch. He also announced the creation of 300 new technology jobs in‎ Leeds, London and Milan to focus on enhancing its ability to ""deploy in and out-of-home streaming platforms"". Sky's announcement of its annual results comes a week after it expressed disappointment that Karen Bradley, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, was deferring a decision on whether to refer 21st Century Fox's takeover bid to competition regulators. Ms Bradley had already indicated that she was minded to refer the proposed transaction to the Competition and Markets Authority."
2017-07-26,"Britain needs an arrangement on the European Arrest Warrant in place for Brexit if it wants to avoid an ""unacceptable risk"", a Lords report has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/arrest-warrant-gap-after-brexit-would-pose-unacceptable-risk-10963082,"The Lords EU Home Affairs Sub-Committee urged the Government to avoid any gap on extradition procedures after the country leaves the European Union in March 2019. The arrest warrant - which is valid across the bloc and requires a member state to apprehend and transfer a suspect sought by another member state - is widely seen as a success story within the EU. Committee chairman Lord Jay said that since its introduction ""the UK has used the European Arrest Warrant to achieve the extradition of 1,000 individuals back to this country, including several high-profile criminals like Hussain Osman, who attempted to carry out a terror attack on the London Underground in 2005"". But the Lords report expressed concern that a ""cliff-edge"" situation could occur, noting that the present system is overseen by a body - the European Court of Justice - which the Government insists should have no jurisdiction over UK matters after Brexit. ""An operational gap between the European Arrest Warrant ceasing to apply and a suitable replacement coming into force would pose an unacceptable risk,"" it said. The study said Britain could seek a bilateral extradition agreement with the EU that broadly mirrors the current warrant system and contains provisions for mechanism to solve any disputes. Norway and Iceland have struck such a deal, but the report noted the agreement with the two countries have taken years to negotiate and still has not come into force. Therefore, the report said that the Government might need to accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ as it seeks a ""phased process of implementation"" of arrangements. But even this might be difficult to secure, it said. In the absence of a new system, the UK might need to go back to the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition. But according to the report, experts said this would be ""counter-productive, inefficient, and not an adequate substitute."" Lord Jay said: ""Less than three years ago, Theresa May, in her role as home secretary, opted to maintain the UK's involvement in the European Arrest Warrant, thereby accepting the European Court of Justice's role in overseeing the European Arrest Warrant. ""She stated that it was in the national interest to retain cooperation with other EU countries in order to keep the British public safe. ""Now as then, the safety of the people of the UK should be the Government's overriding consideration. ""In March 2017, the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, said that it was a priority for the Government to ensure that we remain part of the European Arrest Warrant arrangement. ""This is welcome, but it was not clear to the committee how this objective will be compatible with the Government's plans to remove the jurisdiction of the court of justice, let alone other aspects of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union."""
2017-07-26,The trauma being experienced by many children living near Grenfell Tower is immense - and those supporting them say their families are not getting enough help.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/not-enough-support-for-children-affected-by-grenfell-tower-fire-10963166,"Ahmed Chellat lost five members of his family in the fire and lives in a flat opposite the tower with grandson Sulayman. The six-year-old was the first in his family to notice the blaze out of his bedroom window. ""Since the 14th June, Sulayman has completely changed,"" Ahmed explained. ""He has frequent night terrors and where he used to watch TV on his own or play while I went to the kitchen, now he cannot be alone at all, he wants to be close to his mum or me. ""He lived the fire, he came out to see it with me and his mother. ""Like all the children here he has been badly affected and it's worse because they are not talking about it."" Since the fire many children have been benefiting by regularly attending school and retaining a sense of routine and normality. Now it is the holidays there is growing concern for the children who have to see the tower every day, walk past the memorials and hear the stories of pain and anguish. Sue Duggins, who works at a nursery near Grenfell Tower, says she has already noticed a difference in the behaviour of the children. ""I'm concerned that the families are not getting the support they need."" she told Sky News. ""We lost one child and her family in the fire and have noticed the children at the nursery now acting out fire play, repeating what they have seen and heard, which is good as it shows they are healing, but it is also shocking and sad to watch."" Grief Encounter is a bereavement charity working directly with around 100 children affected by the fire. Founder Shelley Gilbert said its aim is to help the children have fun and play again without feeling guilty. But she admitted it was proving to be a challenge: ""The terror is palpable and the children are telling stories of feeling trapped with no escape. ""Not only do they talk about the noises and the death screams of people jumping out of windows but more powerfully about the deafening silence. ""As a practitioner I work to help children find that safe space again, but I am not sure we can help in this circumstance. ""The families literally have nowhere to turn."" When Sky News asked the new leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council what it was doing to provide mental health support to children and families, she admitted more needed to be done. Elizabeth Campbell said: ""Every family has a key worker with wrap-around care, but obviously we can do more and I think now is probably the time that we need to look at the model we are providing once again and see if we can improve it."""
2017-07-26,"For years patients have been told to ""complete the course"" of antibiotics or risk resistance but some experts are now saying that the opposite is true.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/should-we-really-complete-course-of-antibiotics-10963397,"Antimicrobial resistance is more of a threat if a patient has treatment for too long, than it is if a patient stops treatment too early, according to Professor Martin Llewelyn at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and his colleagues. In an article in the British Medical Journal, they said that, in many cases, there have been no studies to work out the minimum effective course of treatment. Also, for common bacterial infections, there is no evidence that stopping treatment early increases the risk of resistant infection, they added. Instead, each course should be tailored to the individual patient and alternative messages should be considered, such as ""stop when you feel better"". In the article, the group said that the instruction to ""complete the course"" is ""based on poor evidence"". ""This situation is changing in hospital practice, where biomarkers of treatment response can guide when to stop antibiotic treatment,"" Professor Llewelyn and his colleagues wrote. ""Outside hospital, where repeated testing may not be feasible, patients might be best advised to stop treatment when they feel better, in direct contradiction of WHO (World Health Organisation) advice."" The article comes amid concerns about the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance, which could see common medical procedures such as joint replacements and caesarean sections become life-threatening. Around 700,000 people globally already die from drug-resistant infections such as TB and malaria. Royal Pharmaceutical Society spokesman and consultant pharmacist Dr Kieran Hand, said the article was a ""welcome opening of the debate in the UK on the relationship between the length of a course of antibiotics, efficacy and resistance"". He added: ""As the researchers have pointed out, further research is needed before the 'finish the course' mantra for antibiotics is changed and any alternative message such as 'stop when you feel better' can be confidently advocated."" He said it was also important to consider what might be done with the leftover antibiotics after a patient has stopped treatment, suggesting they could be taken to a pharmacy. ""The ideal future scenario would be that the right length of treatment for a specific infection for patients is identified from clinical trials and the exact quantity needed is prescribed and dispensed."" The Government's chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said: ""The message to the public remains the same - people should always follow the advice of healthcare professionals. ""To update policies we need further research to inform them. ""The Department of Health will continue to review the evidence on prescribing and drug resistant infections, as we aim to continue the great progress we have made at home and abroad on this issue."""

That's less than half the rate one might previously have considered normal. :: Sluggish growth continues for economy That weak growth, as the Chancellor told me, is partly down to Brexit - the nervousness faced by businesses and consumers, unsure of our future relationship with the EU and unwilling to invest as much as they would have done. And yet, despite wanting to tell businesses that they will have a transition period - something to ease the shift from being inside to being outside the EU - he simply can't. In his words, he ""can't give a cast iron guarantee"" - because Britain has yet to agree to a transition with its European counterparts. It is an invidious situation. On the bright side, the UK economy is not mired in the recession some economists feared after the referendum. But annual growth of less than 2%, which is what the IMF now expects for the UK, implies Britons feeling the pinch for many more months. Indeed, having been the industrialised world's fastest growing economy before the vote, it is now one of the weaker performers. And yet because government has been effectively paralysed by Brexit, and because the negotiations are only now creaking into action, there is little he can do to try to relieve that uncertainty. No wonder he told me that talks over the so-called ""implementation period"" should be the first thing on the agenda in Brussels. Still, it's a reminder of how much things have changed for UK economic policymaking in the past few months. Remember: Britain has plenty of challenges not related to Europe. Productivity is weak - real wages were squeezed well before one considers the post-vote period - and there are worries that the UK is punching below its weight on innovation and industrial policy. And yet because of the referendum - and then June's election - the Chancellor has little realistic prospect of imposing major reforms on the UK economy. He can't even guarantee the implementation period he and business want - despite having (eventually) persuaded his Brexiteer cabinet colleagues that it's necessary. A tough spot to be in. Then again, no one said this would be easy."
2017-07-26,"Britain will not accept imports of chlorine-washed chicken in pursuit of a trade deal with the US after Brexit, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/gove-rules-out-imports-of-us-chlorine-chicken-in-post-brexit-trade-deal-10962562,"The issue has taken centre stage amid fears that Britain might have to relax food standards to secure trade deals after it leaves the European Union. News reports said in recent days that the Government was split over the issue. Mr Gove was asked whether US chlorinated chicken would be allowed in Britain as part of a future deal. ""No. I have made it perfectly clear, and indeed this is something on which all members of the Government are agreed, that we are not going to dilute our high animal welfare standards, or our high environmental standards, in pursuit of any trade deal,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. This week Trade Secretary Liam Fox was criticised for dismissing the issue of chlorinated chicken as ""a detail at the very end-stage of one sector of a potential free trade agreement"" with the US. During a trip to Washington for talks with US trade representatives, Dr Fox said there was ""no health issue"" with the controversial practice, but said it was ""too early"" to comment on the specifics of a free trade agreement. In his interview, Mr Gove sought to defend his colleague's comments. ""The Trade Secretary quite rightly pointed out that of course this issue is important but we mustn't concentrate just on this one issue when we look at the huge potential that a trade deal can bring,"" he said. But Labour seized on the apparent rift within the Government. Shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman attacked what she called a ""casual and inconsistent attitude towards the importing of chlorinated chicken"". ""Theresa May must put an end to the internal disarray in her Cabinet and set the record straight by publicly supporting British poultry farmers and committing to protect the British public from substandard food produce in a race-to-the-bottom Brexit,"" she said. This week, the House of Lords Energy and Environment sub-committee warned that animal welfare standards could be undermined if post-Brexit trade deals left UK farmers competing against less-regulated foreign rivals. As an EU member, Britain is not free to agree trade deals with any third parties, but striking a trade deal with the US will be a top priority after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019. Dr Fox's trip to Washington was aimed at preparing the ground for a future deal, and he goes to Mexico next. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has travelled to Australia. The practice of washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water is done to kill any bacteria on the meat after slaughter as well as to reduce the risk of contamination from the bird's digestive tract. The practice is widespread in the US but has been banned in the EU since 1997. Brussels allows washing only with cold air or water."
2017-07-26,It appeared to come out of nowhere: three decisively worded tweets that left the future of thousands of active US service members hanging in the balance.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/trump-transgender-ban-is-policy-making-in-reverse-10963342,"Donald Trump's ban on transgender troops is another smackdown of an Obama-era policy and is very much at odds with his campaign pledge to support the LGBTQ community. Wednesday's White House press briefing was back on camera with new press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders clearly on a mission to bring a positive, softer tone to proceedings. She started with the news that the President is donating his second-quarter salary ($100,000) to the Department of Education and then read a letter to him from a nine-year-old fan. Then came a barrage of questions about the ban. ""What about the thousands of active transgender troops in surgery across the world?"" There was no definitive answer. The implementation process has yet to be worked out. This was policy-making in reverse. Democrats were quick to criticise the ban calling it an ""all out assault"" on the LGBTQ community. Republican senator John McCain said it was ""yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made on Twitter"". Caitlyn Jenner, who supported Mr Trump during the campaign, criticised his failure to fight for the ""15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military"". It was no secret that the policy was being reviewed. Defence secretary James Mattis had delayed its implementation, saying he needed more time. But it seems Trump has leapt ahead. Even the Pentagon was surprised at the timing and delivery method of this policy change. The unpredictable president is at it again - successfully shifting the unwanted focus on Russia and the future of his Attorney General."
2017-07-26,Legal pressure has forced the Government to get tough on air pollution - but its latest phased and targeted plan hasn't pleased everyone.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170727085851/http://news.sky.com/story/clever-politics-in-the-governments-car-pollution-solution-10962694,"There is an acknowledgement that pinpointing specific roads around the country, where levels of nitrogen dioxide are at their highest, is better than a quick national fix which could penalise drivers. But councils worry the £255m being allocated by Westminster won't be enough to help them tackle the problems, especially given tightening budgets. Added to that, stripping away traffic calming measures to reduce cars braking and accelerating (which doubles exhaust emissions) could also compromise road safety: speed bumps on roads by schools, for example, are there for a reason. But while Greenpeace says ""real solutions, not gimmicks"" are required, the proposals are designed to both satisfy legal requirements (after a court deemed the Government's record on reducing air pollution to be so poor as to be illegal under EU rules) and phase in changes so the car industry is not alarmed. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has warned an outright ban on petrol and diesel cars could ""undermine the UK's automotive sector"", which employs 800,000 people and is already exhibiting nervousness over the possible impact of Brexit. But the Government's decision to consult on plans for a targeted scrappage scheme for polluting vehicles this autumn is designed to allay industry fears, while also allowing local authorities to come up with their own trade-in alternatives. So there is also some clever politics here. The Government has passed the onus of sorting out these pollution hotspots to local authorities, while pushing any ban on ""traditional"" diesel and petrol cars down the road until 2040. Environment Secretary Michael Gove can argue he's given car manufacturers plenty of notice, by which time technology could have made electric vehicles cheaper to produce anyway. He has also put pressure on councils to deal with the immediate concerns of poor air quality and kicked the controversial issue of scrappage into consultation while trailing next year's more comprehensive Clear Air Strategy. Environmentalists were never going to be happy with the speed and scope of Wednesday's plans, but there's enough to neuter any damaging criticism at the start of Parliament's summer break."

""If Jeff Sessions is fired there will be holy hell to pay,"" Mr Graham said. He added: ""Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency - unless Mueller did something wrong. ""Right now I have no reason to believe that Mueller is compromised"". ""Some of the suggestions the President is making go way beyond what's acceptable in a rule of law nation,"" said Mr Graham. Mr Sessions said he would remain in his post for as long as Mr Trump ""sees that as appropriate"". ""If he wants to make a change, he has every right,"" he told the Associated Press in San Salvador on Thursday. ""I serve at the pleasure of the President, I've understood that from the day I took the job."" Senator Graham is one of three preparing a bill to shield Mr Mueller from being sacked. The others working on the effort are Sheldon Whitehouse and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats. All three are on the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is unclear when the bill would be introduced. Mr Blumenthal said that the bill ""might be a committee effort"" and said it would protect Mr Mueller and other special counsels. He said firing Mr Mueller ""would precipitate a firestorm that would be unprecedented in proportions"". Many Republicans have expressed strong support for former Mr Mueller, a former FBI director who was appointed to investigate allegations of Russian meddling in the US election and possible links to the Trump campaign. They have also rallied around Mr Sessions, who has recently become a daily target of critical tweets from Mr Trump. He has publicly scorned Mr Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation into election meddling after he admitted to meeting Russia's ambassador during the campaign. The President said he rued his decision to select him. His criticism has fuelled speculation that Mr Sessions may step down - even if the President stops short of firing him. But he is showing no outward signs that he is planning to quit, and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said Mr Trump ""wants him to lead the department""."

Since the election the Tories have accused the Labour leader of a U-turn and lying to students. But he insists he never made a commitment to write off student debt. Spearheading the latest Tory attack, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""As their £100bn broken promise on student debt shows, Labour aren't being straight with the British public. ""Labour would take out an enormous loan, but are pretending they wouldn't have to make cuts elsewhere to pay for it. ""Families, and working people everywhere know that's not how it works; when you take out a loan you have to pay interest on it, and that means making tough decisions on where to cut back elsewhere."" The Conservatives claim new analysis of Labour's spending plans shows that by the end of this Parliament, public sector net debt would be more than £250bn higher under Labour than under the Conservatives. They claim that means Labour would spend £5.8bn more a year in debt interest payments, the equivalent to the pay of around 65,000 nurses, 56,000 teachers and 53,000 police officers, putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk. ""This position is clearly untenable,"" the Conservatives write in their letter to Mr McDonnell, which the party claims is signed by 147 Tory MPs. ""Either you will need to make reductions to public spending in areas which you are yet to identify, raise taxes in areas you have yet to identify or break the promises you made to the electorate. ""The public will rightly want to know in order to fund your extra borrowing: What areas of public spending you will reduce? What new taxes you plan to raise or introduce? What further election promises you will break?"" The target of the Tory attack is an interview given by Mr Corbyn to the New Musical Express six days before the election. It was reported at the time that he had hinted he would wipe out debt for thousands of graduates. But while Labour's pledge to abolish tuition fees was a major part of its election campaign, there was no promise to write off student debts - worth £100bn - in the party's manifesto. In his NME interview, Mr Corbyn said: ""Yes, there is a block of those that currently have a massive debt, and I'm looking at ways that we could reduce that, ameliorate that, lengthen the period of paying it off, or some other means of reducing that debt burden. ""I don't have the simple answer for it yet - I don't think anybody would expect me to, because this election was called unexpectedly; we had two weeks to prepare all this - but I'm very well aware of that problem. ""And I don't see why those that had the historical misfortune to be at university during the £9,000 period should be burdened excessively compared to those that went before or those that come after. I will deal with it."" Asked about the Tory attacks in a TV interview earlier this week, Mr Corbyn said: ""I recognised it was a huge burden, I did not make a commitment we would write it off because I couldn't at that stage. ""I pointed out we had written the manifesto in a short space of time because it was a surprise election but that we would look at ways of reducing that debt burden, recognising quite a lot of it is never going to be collected anyway and try and reduce that."""

The pair are understood to have used a moped before carrying out the assault on the 31-year-old victim in Greenwich on 15 July. The killing has been connected to two other robberies - one in Greenwich on 11 July and another in Southwark on 13 July. Mr Pearce had been on a night out with his girlfriend at the time the attack took place in King William Walk, to the north of Greenwich Park. He was walking home from Oliver's Jazz Club when he was confronted at 12.15am. He was ordered to hand over his silver Datejust II 2017 Rolex, said to be worth thousands of pounds. He refused but was then chased by one of the men who stabbed him with a large knife before he was then shot at by the second suspect with a handgun. The attackers only stopped when the victim's girlfriend shouted at them that she would give them the watch if they stopped. CCTV footage filmed moments before showed the men - dressed in dark clothing and wearing helmets - at a Texaco petrol station in Creek Road, near Deptford, about half a mile away. The men are said to have escaped in the direction of Nevada Street, close to the northwest corner of Greenwich Park. Metropolitan Police Detective Inspector Jo Sidaway said: ""Danny sought help at a nearby address but was fatally attacked by the suspects who showed no mercy and only stopped their attack when the victim's girlfriend shouted out to them. ""Without a hint of remorse they then took the watch and fled the scene."" Mr Pearce, from Bromley, was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. In the linked attacks, individuals were targeted for their watches and threatened with weapons which were not used. The ONS' report on national crime figures released last week, which showed a rise in recorded robbery, said an increase in moped thefts ""could be a contributing factor in the rise in... robbery""."

A police cordon was put in place around a bag the man was carrying. A spokesman for Great Manchester Police said it was following standard procedure and referring the incident to the force's Professional Standards Branch and the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission).
2017-07-27,An elderly woman who went missing has been found by a sniffer dog because she bottled her scent. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170728092943/http://news.sky.com/story/elderly-woman-found-by-sniffer-dog-because-she-bottled-her-scent-10964247,"The woman, who has dementia, disappeared from her Florida home for around two hours on Monday. But she was found less than five minutes after a sniffer dog was given a sample of her scent to trace. The elderly woman, who made the sample around two years ago, was returned home safely. In a Facebook post, Citrus County Sheriff's Office said: ""Do you have a SCENT PRESERVATION KIT? K9 Ally hopes that you do. ""Last night K9 Ally and her handler, Deputy Justin Williams successfully tracked a missing endangered elderly woman with dementia."" Scent preservation involves using cotton pads to swab underarms and putting them in sealed containers to retain the smell. Traditionally, sniffer dogs would take the scent of missing people from their pillows or items of clothing. Police forces in the US are encouraging people to use scent preservation kits to make searches for lost friends and relatives easier. Sumter County Sheriff's Office, which offers the kits for free, says they are especially helpful for people with ""diminishing mental faculties or children"". Scent preservation kits are more effective than old rags because they haven't been contaminated by other smells. K9 Ally was rewarded with an ice cream for tracking down the missing woman."

The investigation by trade magazine Inside Housing also found 71 blocks were suffering from a lack or deficiency of emergency lighting in stairwells or communal areas. And at 73 buildings, residents were either offered no safety information for fires or it was unclear or incorrect. There are around 4,000 tower blocks across England, at which there is no legal requirement for those managing the buildings to carry out the fire-safety assessments within a specific time-frame. Fire experts, however, recommend annual checks. The overall fire risk at the blocks could still be higher than FRAs portray, as many were said to be ""type 1"" assessments, meaning they did not examine the state of flats themselves or cladding and insulation on their exterior. A nationwide safety operation was launched to establish how many buildings were clad in material similar to that blamed for aiding the Grenfell fire's spread, exposing hundreds potentially at risk. Ronnie King, honorary administrative secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group, said: ""Unless assessors go into flats there's no point. ""Fire resistance can get punctured by people breaking into cavities to do other work."" FRAs from the blocks were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from 36 councils or arms-length management organisations and seven housing associations, dated between 2012 and July 2017 - meaning some issues could have since been resolved."

Before the killing, she had sent a photo of Macey to the child's father, along with the message: ""Savour the last ever picture… possibly see you in court."" Jackson, from Stoke-on-Trent, had also written a suicide note which said: ""There's nothing for me or Macey, life's s***."" The 20-year-old initially denied murdering her daughter, but she changed her plea partway through the trial at Stafford Crown Court. When the case began, prosecutors said Macey's body had been discovered by police on a floor in a bedroom after 999 was called - with Jackson attempting CPR on the toddler. Jackson, who has a history of self-harm, was found to have ""superficial"" injuries to her wrist, neck and chest. The court had been told that Jackson was angry and resentful towards Macey's father, Paul Hogan, following the breakdown of their relationship. Sentencing the student to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 16 years and 114 days, Judge Michael Chambers QC said: ""You had the courage to plead guilty and recognise the enormity of what you have done. ""I accept that may have not come easy but this remains a very serious case - for a mother to kill her young child, who depends on her for protection above all others, is a wicked and appalling act. ""This is not a case where you suffered from mental illness. The clear inference is that you thought about killing yourself and decided to kill Macey as well as to prevent her having a life without a mother. That was an expression of utter self-absorption."" Judge Chambers added that it was impossible to know whether the pictures and messages sent to Macey's father were references to a potential custody hearing, or whether they had a ""more sinister"" explanation. Speaking outside court, Detective Inspector Dan Ison of Staffordshire Police said:"" We now know that the 999 call was a completely fraudulent call. ""There was clearly direction being given for CPR to be carried out on Macey and we know that she had been dead for some time by that point. ""It was a complete hoax, a sham as Judge Chambers referred to it. It goes to show the coldness of Cody-Anne's defence."""
2017-07-27,Legal pressure has forced the Government to get tough on air pollution - but its latest phased and targeted plan hasn't pleased everyone.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170728092943/http://news.sky.com/story/clever-politics-in-the-governments-car-pollution-solution-10962694,"There is an acknowledgement that pinpointing specific roads around the country, where levels of nitrogen dioxide are at their highest, is better than a quick national fix which could penalise drivers. But councils worry the £255m being allocated by Westminster won't be enough to help them tackle the problems, especially given tightening budgets. Added to that, stripping away traffic calming measures to reduce cars braking and accelerating (which doubles exhaust emissions) could also compromise road safety: speed bumps on roads by schools, for example, are there for a reason. But while Greenpeace says ""real solutions, not gimmicks"" are required, the proposals are designed to both satisfy legal requirements (after a court deemed the Government's record on reducing air pollution to be so poor as to be illegal under EU rules) and phase in changes so the car industry is not alarmed. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has warned an outright ban on petrol and diesel cars could ""undermine the UK's automotive sector"", which employs 800,000 people and is already exhibiting nervousness over the possible impact of Brexit. But the Government's decision to consult on plans for a targeted scrappage scheme for polluting vehicles this autumn is designed to allay industry fears, while also allowing local authorities to come up with their own trade-in alternatives. So there is also some clever politics here. The Government has passed the onus of sorting out these pollution hotspots to local authorities, while pushing any ban on ""traditional"" diesel and petrol cars down the road until 2040. Environment Secretary Michael Gove can argue he's given car manufacturers plenty of notice, by which time technology could have made electric vehicles cheaper to produce anyway. He has also put pressure on councils to deal with the immediate concerns of poor air quality and kicked the controversial issue of scrappage into consultation while trailing next year's more comprehensive Clear Air Strategy. Environmentalists were never going to be happy with the speed and scope of Wednesday's plans, but there's enough to neuter any damaging criticism at the start of Parliament's summer break."

Operating profit after exceptional items was up 13.8% and profit after tax was up by 2.3% compared to the same period last year. The group, which also owns Aer Lingus and Iberia, had to pay around £58m in additional compensation and baggage claims after the IT problems during the spring bank holiday weekend. The failure saw 726 flights cancelled and left around 75,000 passengers stranded over three days of chaos that began on 27 May. The falling value of the pound also cost the firm about £39.3m. But IAG boss Willie Walsh described the second quarter performance, which was helped by lower fuel costs, as ""very strong"". He added: ""The underlying trend in unit revenue improved, benefiting partially from Easter and a weak base last year."" The group launched long-haul, low-cost brand Level in March, which Mr Walsh said was proving successful. ""In June, Level started long-haul flights from Barcelona to four destinations,"" he said. ""Sales continue to be well ahead of our expectations. ""We've ordered three additional aircraft and are considering other European bases for the operation."" Looking ahead, IAG said: ""At current fuel prices and exchange rates, IAG expects its operating profit for 2017 to show a double-digit percentage improvement year-on-year. ""The group expects second-half passenger unit revenue to show an increase versus last year, at constant currency."" The optimism was in contrast to competitors such as Lufthansa, Ryanair and easyJet, which have warned that pressure on fares may impact on their performance. Mr Walsh told reporters: ""All we can say is what we see. ""Clearly what we see in terms of our performance does appear to be somewhat different to what others are saying. ""It may not be different to what they're seeing but it's certainly different to what they've said. ""But we're calling it as we see it and our first half performance was very strong."" Unite said that the firm's profits showed British Airways could afford to resolve the industrial dispute with its mixed-fleet cabin crew workers. Oliver Richardson, Unite's national officer for civil aviation, said: ""It is, frankly, obscene to keep thousands of BA's workforce on poverty pay at the same time as the company makes millions of pounds."""

She said there was ""much more to do"" to achieve equality, as a poll showed many Britons hold anti-gay views. ""I am proud of the role my party has played in recent years in advocating a Britain which seeks to end discrimination on the grounds of sexuality or gender identity,"" said Mrs May. But I acknowledge where we have been wrong on these issues in the past,"" she added, writing in the Website PinkNews alongside former prime ministers and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to mark the anniversary. ""There will justifiably be scepticism about the positions taken and votes cast down through the years by the Conservative Party, and by me, compared to where we are now. ""But, like the country we serve, my Party and I have come a long way."" A YouGov poll commissioned by PinkNews showed that 42% of Britons believe that gay sex is unnatural. Another 48% believe that primary school children, aged five to 11, should not be taught about homosexual relationships in school. The poll, conducted on 23-24 July, suggested that Conservative and Brexit supporters were more likely to oppose gay rights than Labour or Remain voters. The PinkNews chief executive, Benjamin Cohen, said some of the results, 50 years after the Sexual Offences Act, were ""depressing"". But he added: ""It is gratifying though to know that for younger people, gay relationships are considered perfectly natural and they strongly support gay parents and teaching young people about gay relationships."" Mrs May has voted in the past against allowing gay couples to adopt children, and this year she faced criticism after she struck a deal at Westminster with the Democratic Unionist Party, which opposes gay marriage. Her Conservative predecessor David Cameron legalised gay weddings in England and Wales, calling it one of his ""proudest achievements"" at Downing Street. Mr Cameron has also apologised for this party's support of Section 28, a notorious piece of legislation which in 1988 banned the promotion of homosexuality in school. Section 28 was repealed in the 2000s. In 2013, Alan Turing, the computer pioneer and mathematician who broke the German Enigma codes during the Second World War, was given a posthumous royal pardon after he was convicted in 1952 of gross indecency. And more recently, a law granted posthumous pardon to thousands of men who were convicted for homosexuality."

2017-07-27,Police investigating the Grenfell Tower fire say there are grounds to suspect corporate manslaughter may have been committed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170728092943/http://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-fire-grounds-for-corporate-manslaughter-charges-10964307,"In a letter to residents affected by the disaster, the Metropolitan Police said both Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation could be prosecuted. Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said residents ""deserve answers"" about the fire and the council would support the police investigation and ""cooperate in every way we can"". But one MP has said charges of gross negligence manslaughter should be pursued, because corporate manslaughter only carries a fine. At least 80 people were killed when the blaze ripped through the 24-storey block in west London on 14 June. The police letter said: ""In due course, a senior representative of each corporation will be formally interviewed by police in relation to the potential offence. ""This interview will not take place immediately, since it is important that all relevant facts and information have been gathered before any such interview is conducted."" The force added that the facts were ""simply an update on the investigation so far"", adding: ""The content of this note should not be taken to conclude that the identified offences and organisations are the only offences, organisations or individuals that are being investigated."" Yvette Williams, a coordinator at the Justice 4 Grenfell campaign group, said the development would help restore trust between the police and the community. She said: ""We welcome that there is enough information and evidence to go down the corporate prosecution route for the TMO and RBKC. ""However, what we would like to see running alongside that is individuals being prosecuted. ""We want is individuals named and prosecuted - you can have both, but we don't want corporate manslaughter on its own. ""People implement policy, people make decisions, people took particular actions and those people are responsible. ""You can't put corporate organisations in the dock, you put individuals."" Labour MP David Lammy, who lost a friend in the fire, said a fine for any organisation prosecuted ""would not represent justice"". He said: ""Gross negligence manslaughter carries a punishment of prison time and I hope that the police and the CPS are considering manslaughter caused by gross negligence."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott welcomed the development, but said other issues needed to be investigated. This included ""the treatment of survivors and their families since the tragic events, and more widely how social housing tenants across the country have been treated for years, where outsourcing, deregulation and privatisation have been prioritised over the safety and wellbeing of tenants"". The Labour MP added: ""Those responsible must be held to account for their actions, and their neglect."" The council's initial response to the fire was slammed as chaotic and inadequate. Nicholas Paget-Brown and Rock Feilding-Mellen bowed to public pressure and quit their roles as leader and deputy leader respectively, but the change of leadership has done little to satisfy residents. Robert Black, chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, also stepped down to ""concentrate on assisting with the investigation and inquiry""."
2017-07-27,Council leaders say the Government is dragging its heels over a promise to replace billions of pounds of European funding after Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170728092943/http://news.sky.com/story/government-dragging-its-heels-over-post-brexit-funding-say-council-leaders-10964848,"Some €10.5bn of European Union structural and investment funds have been allocated to local authorities for spending between 2014 and 2020 on a wide range of projects, including business support, job creation and infrastructure. But the Local Government Association says the Government has given ""scarce detail"" about how it intends to implement a manifesto commitment to provide a UK shared prosperity fund to replace the money when Britain leaves the EU. The cash is targeted mostly at areas of need, with Cornwall and West Wales receiving more than £800 per person, while the Scottish Highlands and parts of North East England get around £300 per person. In Redcar, which has some of the worst deprivation in the country, civil engineer Rob Lynas was given help from the funding to set up a small business after being made redundant. He now employs three staff and says the 12 hours of free business advice he was given, along with access to a cheap start-up loan, was vital to the firm's success. He told Sky News: ""It helped us to get the wheels in motion for setting up the business - business plans, helping us with arranging finance."" Mr Lynas added: ""We got some finance at a more favourable rate because banks weren't interested in start-ups at that point. ""It allowed us to invest in some really good IT and move into this office, and get our desks and chairs. I think everything would have been a lot slower without it. ""It was very worthwhile. It made a massive difference, giving us some confidence that we were going in the right direction."" Councillor Kevin Bentley, chairman of the LGA's Brexit Task and Finish Group, said the future of EU regeneration funding is vital for local authorities. ""Councils have used EU funds to help new businesses start up, create thousands of new jobs, roll out broadband and build new roads and bridges,"" he said. ""To further its devolution commitments, we want to work with the Government to help develop a fully-funded and locally-driven successor scheme."""

That's less than half the rate one might previously have considered normal. :: Sluggish growth continues for economy That weak growth, as the Chancellor told me, is partly down to Brexit - the nervousness faced by businesses and consumers, unsure of our future relationship with the EU and unwilling to invest as much as they would have done. And yet, despite wanting to tell businesses that they will have a transition period - something to ease the shift from being inside to being outside the EU - he simply can't. In his words, he ""can't give a cast iron guarantee"" - because Britain has yet to agree to a transition with its European counterparts. It is an invidious situation. On the bright side, the UK economy is not mired in the recession some economists feared after the referendum. But annual growth of less than 2%, which is what the IMF now expects for the UK, implies Britons feeling the pinch for many more months. Indeed, having been the industrialised world's fastest growing economy before the vote, it is now one of the weaker performers. And yet because government has been effectively paralysed by Brexit, and because the negotiations are only now creaking into action, there is little he can do to try to relieve that uncertainty. No wonder he told me that talks over the so-called ""implementation period"" should be the first thing on the agenda in Brussels. Still, it's a reminder of how much things have changed for UK economic policymaking in the past few months. Remember: Britain has plenty of challenges not related to Europe. Productivity is weak - real wages were squeezed well before one considers the post-vote period - and there are worries that the UK is punching below its weight on innovation and industrial policy. And yet because of the referendum - and then June's election - the Chancellor has little realistic prospect of imposing major reforms on the UK economy. He can't even guarantee the implementation period he and business want - despite having (eventually) persuaded his Brexiteer cabinet colleagues that it's necessary. A tough spot to be in. Then again, no one said this would be easy."

The main consumer confidence index fell a further two points after a five-point dip in June, GfK said, to hit its post-Brexit low of July last year - a reading of -12. Any reading above zero indicates optimism. The survey, which is conducted across the EU, also found expectations within the UK's for its economy over next 12 months had dropped five points while the measure of changes to personal finances over the last year also fell, making it one point lower than this time last year. The latter finding follows the growing squeeze this year on household budgets from the Brexit-linked collapse in the value of the pound, which has raised import costs and therefore prices for many goods and services. At the same time, wage growth has been sluggish - reflecting concern among businesses for the economy as the UK starts to negotiate the terms of the country's divorce from the EU. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said: ""The economic picture across the UK remains confusing and this mood is reflected in the overall index score, which is down by five points. ""It's the sharp drop in confidence about the UK's general economy - both looking back one year and ahead one year - that is driving the fall. ""While there's a small bounce in consumer views of personal finance looking ahead, that's the only measure that's up. ""All bets must now be on a further drift downwards in confidence."" The findings reflect those of other surveys which have pointed to the General Election result - a hung parliament - adding to Brexit anxieties already prevalent among consumers and businesses alike. It suggests the poll has proved something of an economic - rather than just a political - own goal for the Government. It was revealed on Wednesday that UK growth continued to remain anaemic in the second quarter of the year, with the first estimate of output growth coming in at 0.3% following a rise of just 0.2% between January and March. Economists believe the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates next week - given more intense debate among policymakers - has now become less likely. A research note by Capital Economics on Thursday suggested hawks (those in support of raising rates) on the monetary policy committee would remain in a minority for some time to come. It said: ""The Committee will no doubt want to wait for clearer signs that the economy is holding up in the face of higher inflation and Brexit-related uncertainty."""

High Court judge Mr Justice Francis has ruled that Charlie will be moved from Great Ormond Street (GOSH) to a hospice, where his artificial ventilation will be removed after a ""period"" of time. He said the terminally ill child will ""inevitably"" die soon after. In a statement, Ms Yates said GOSH had ""denied us our final wish"". She said: ""We just want some peace with our son, no hospital, no lawyers, no courts, no media, just quality time with Charlie away from everything to say goodbye to him in the most loving way. ""Most people won't ever have to go through what we have been through, we've had no control over our son's life and no control over our son's death."" Ms Yates added that two doctors and a team of intensive care nurses had offered to provide care for Charlie, but Mr Justice Francis ""ordered against what we have arranged and has agreed to what GOSH asked"". She said: ""This subsequently gives us very little time with our son. ""I'm not allowed to disclose the time or place but I'm shocked that after all we've been through they won't allow us this extra time."" Earlier, GOSH said it regretted that its ""profound and heartfelt"" differences with Charlie's parents had played out in court. It said: ""Sadly, as the judge has now ruled, there is simply no way that Charlie, a patient with such severe and complex needs, can spend any significant time outside of an intensive care environment safely. ""The risk of an unplanned and chaotic end to Charlie's life is an unthinkable outcome for all concerned and would rob his parents of precious last moments with him."" It added: ""Every single one of us wishes there could have been a less tragic outcome."" The latest legal row began when GOSH said it was not practical to get the equipment the child needs into the family home, as his ventilator is unable to fit through the front door. Charlie suffers from a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness, and he also has brain damage. He requires invasive ventilation to breathe and cannot see, hear or swallow. Born a ""perfectly healthy"" baby on 4 August last year, Charlie's fight against terminal illness has made headlines across the globe. After finding an American doctor willing to offer the child experimental treatment, Ms Yates set up a crowdfunding page in January and raised £1.3m. However, in April, Mr Justice Francis agreed with GOSH the experimental treatment was ""very unlikely"" to work and ruled doctors could withdraw all treatment except end of life care in the ""best interests"" of Charlie. On Monday, Ms Yates and Mr Gard withdrew their application to take him out of the UK for treatment."

In the year to March 2017, there were 26,643 assaults, including a record 7,159 attacks on prison staff - equivalent to 20 a day. The statistics are the latest to lay bare the scale of the safety crisis in the prison system, including violence, drug use and overcrowding. They will prompt fresh scrutiny on the jail estate and pile pressure on the Government after several violent incidents. Justice Secretary David Lidington said the figures ""reinforce how crucial it is that we make progress as quickly as possible"" on improving safety and security in prisons. Of the inmates released in error, 58 were freed at prison establishments while 13 were released during escort or at courts. Examples of errors can include misplaced warrants for imprisonment or remand, recall notices not being acted on, sentence miscalculations or discharging the wrong person on escort. Earlier in July, an inmate who was released from prison just months into a nine-year sentence due to a ""clerical error"" was arrested after weeks on the run. Ralston Dodd was jailed after a stabbing attack but was sent home early because his prison term had been recorded incorrectly. The Ministry of Justice said then that it was an ""extremely rare"" error. In its latest findings, the ministry said serious assaults on staff had trebled since 2013, reaching 805, while assaults in female prisons reached 1,023, the highest for at least nine years. It reported 15 escapes from prisons or prisoner escorts and found that the performance of 10 jails was of ""serious concern"". Mr Lidington said that improving safety was his priority. ""I have seen first-hand the challenges our dedicated and hardworking prison staff face,"" he said. ""Boosting the frontline is critical to achieving safety and the number of prison officers we are recruiting is rising, with the number of new prison officers joining the service at its highest level since 2010."" The Government is seeking to add 2,500 frontline officers. Campaigners and watchdogs have issued several warnings about the state of prisons. Peter Clarke, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, warned this month that staffing levels in many establishments were too low to maintain order and said many inmates were kept in ""squalid, dirty and disgraceful"" conditions."
2017-07-27,The head of the Boy Scouts has apologised to members of the scouting community who were offended by Donald Trump's recent speech.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170728092943/http://news.sky.com/story/scouting-leader-sorry-for-political-rhetoric-in-trumps-speech-10964557,"While other US presidents have delivered non-political speeches at past scout jamborees, Mr Trump promoted his political agenda and criticised his rivals when he addressed nearly 40,000 scouts and adults in West Virginia. He also induced some of the scouts in attendance to boo Barack Obama. Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh said: ""I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree. ""That was never our intent... We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program."" Mr Surbaugh noted that every sitting president since 1937 has been invited to visit the jamboree and that such an invitation is ""in no way an endorsement of any person, party or policies"". He said: ""For years, people have called upon us to take a position on political issues, and we have steadfastly remained non-partisan and refused to comment on political matters."" Mr Saurbaugh said the controversy had not totally overshadowed the 10-day jamboree, but admitted it did have an effect. ""Scouts have continued to trade patches, climb rock walls, and share stories about the day's adventures,"" he said. ""But for our Scouting family at home not able to see these real moments of Scouting, we know the past few days have been overshadowed by the remarks offered by the President of the United States."" President of the Boy Scouts Randall Stephenson said that they suspected Mr Trump might cause controversy, but felt obliged to invite him out of respect for the office of the presidency. Mr Stephenson was asked if the scouts would invite Mr Trump back to address the next national jamboree if he is re-elected in 2020. ""I don't see why we would break with tradition, whoever is holding office,"" he replied. ""We are not to going to censor or edit the president of the United States. That's beyond our pay grade, regardless of who it is."""
2017-07-27,The publication of a bizarre and expletive-laden rant by White House Director of Communications Anthony Scaramucci has prompted fresh questions over chaos in the White House. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170728092943/http://news.sky.com/story/anthony-scaramuccis-rant-prompts-questions-over-white-house-stability-10964774,"In comments published in the New Yorker on Thursday, Mr Scaramucci called a senior colleague a ""paranoid schizophrenic"" and threatened to ""eliminate everyone"" in his communications team. ""I'm not Steve Bannon,"" he continued. ""I'm not trying to suck my own c***"". :: Scaramucci has a lot to learn about the workings of Washington The slur - likely figurative rather than literal - seeks to imply Mr Bannon places his own interests before those of the White House. Mr Scaramucci insisted that he, in contrast, was not trying to build his ""own brand off the f***ing strength of the President"". Mr Scaramucci delivered the diatribe after phoning reporter Ryan Lizza on Wednesday night. He had contacted him to demand he reveal the source of information tweeted about a dinner between President Donald Trump, media figures and himself. The newly-appointed Director of Communications is believed to have an intense rivalry with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer, who resigned his post as Press Secretary when Mr Scaramucci was hired by Mr Trump one week ago. During much of the phone call he focused on his conviction that Mr Priebus had ""c***-blocked"" and orchestrated leaks against him. ""C***-blocking"" generally refers to attempts to prevent someone making sexual advances, but in this case Mr Scaramucci appears to be accusing Mr Priebus of obstructing his success in Mr Trump's White House administration. As the conversation continued Mr Scaramucci's tone became more aggressive, and he began referring to himself in the third person as ""the Mooch"", suggesting he had ""nailed"" his colleagues for what he believed to be potentially unlawful behaviour. The publication of the comments on Thursday prompted a mixed reaction from Republicans and shocked glee on Twitter. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Mr Scaramucci had ""used some colourful language"" but added she did not expect a repeat performance. Mr Scaramucci tweeted on Thursday evening that he ""made a mistake in trusting in a reporter"", adding ""it won't happen again"". Mr Lizza had noted that Mr Scaramucci initiated the call with him and had not requested that his words remain off-the-record. Mr Scaramucci's media missteps however, are perhaps unsurprising. The White House's new Director of Communications does not have substantial experience as a political spokesperson and founded a hedge fund before joining the Trump administration."

An early morning service from West Sussex to London run by Southern Rail is the UK's worst offender, according to statistics taken from weekday trains in major cities across England and Wales last year. Other jam-packed journeys making the top 10 overcrowded list include the 6.57am Brighton to Bedford, the 7.55am Cambridge to London King's Cross and the 4pm Manchester Airport to Edinburgh. Co-director of the Association of British Commuters, Bradley Rees, told Sky News: ""We're in the third year of remedial measures on Southern Rail now, and they have been continually breaching their performance metrics. ""Year on year we've seen them fail to meet their performance benchmarks, and the bar keeps getting lowered. What has to happen before this massive franchise - which is basically out of control and not performing in any way that passengers need - does something to change the situation?"" Referring to the ""over complicated"" network, split up between lots of different rail companies, he said it was ""prone to failure"" and said there was little incentive for companies to get better. The Department for Transport has promised that extra services will be added to routes south of London next year, following completion of the Thameslink Programme.

Each season has a different team of celebrities trying several winter sports like bobsleigh, ski jumping and snowskates. Among its most famous injuries was decorated Olympian athlete Sir Bradley Wiggins, who broke his leg during the last season. Irish model and DJ Vogue Williams was forced to quit this year's show just days before the series kicked off after falling badly and rupturing her knee in training. During the last series, former Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle required surgery to fuse fractured vertebrae in her neck following a crash. Fellow Olympian Rebecca Adlington also withdrew from the show on medical advice after dislocating her shoulder. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for Channel 4 said the broadcaster will not renew the show for the next year, due to the amount of winter sports on air. ""The Jump has been a hugely successful brand for Channel 4 over the last four years,"" she said. ""However, with such a huge amount of winter sport on screen at the start of 2018 we have decided to rest the show for the year."" The 2018 Winter Olympics will take place in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February, around the time that The Jump would usually air. Other injuries since the Channel 4 reality show started in 2014 include former model Melinda Messenger suffering concussion after a blow to the head; Sally Bercow (wife of House of Commons speaker John Bercow) fracturing two ribs; and ex-EastEnders actor Joe Swash breaking his shoulder."

2017-07-28,"Ireland is opposed to an ""economic border"" with Northern Ireland and will not help Britain design one for Brexiteers, the Irish Prime Minister has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170729095308/http://news.sky.com/story/ireland-will-not-design-border-for-brexiteers-leo-varadkar-says-10965405,"Signalling growing impatience with London, Leo Varadkar also said little progress had been made in Brexit talks and insisted the onus of finding a workable solution lies with the British Government. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is a sensitive and key issue as London negotiates its divorce from Brussels. It will be the only land frontier between the UK and the EU once Britain leaves in March 2019. But Dublin is unconvinced by the UK's plans to use technology to maintain the invisible land border between the north and south of the island. Instead, according to The Times, Dublin wants customs and immigration checks moved to ports and airports - effectively drawing a new border in the Irish Sea. ""As far as this government is concerned there shouldn't be an economic border. We don't want one,"" Mr Varadkar told reporters. He said the border had been political and not economic since the creation of the European single market at the end of 1992. Politicians in London, Dublin, Belfast and Brussels have all said they want to avoid the return of a ""hard border"", which many think would endanger the peace process. But a solution remains elusive. Speaking in Dublin, the Irish PM rejected suggestions from some British pro-Brexit politicians that technological solutions, such as the tagging of goods and vehicles and computerised customs declarations, might allow free movement and maintain a soft border. ""It's the United Kingdom - it's Britain that has decided to leave, and if they want to put forward smart solutions, technological solutions for borders of the future and all of that, that's up to them,"" he said. ""What we are not going to do is design a border for the Brexiteers. ""They are the ones who want a border, it is up to them to say what it is, to say how it would work and to convince their own people, their own voters, that this is a good idea."" Any suggestion of a sea border was dismissed by the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, who said no such proposal existed. The report in The Times sparked fury among members of the DUP, which props up Theresa May's Government in Westminster. A spokesman for the Department of Exiting the EU said the Government aims for ""as frictionless and seamless a border as possible"" and wants no new barriers. ""Therefore, we cannot create a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,"" said the spokesman. ""It is our priority to deliver a practical solution that recognises the unique social, political and economic circumstances of the border."" DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the BBC'S Today programme that the idea of a sea border was ""absurd and unconstitutional"". 1 of 2 things will now happen 1. A very hard border 2. Ireland will wise up and leave the EU https://t.co/kJ4paGCtVj About 30,000 people cross the current, invisible frontier each day for work, and many farms straddle the border. But a year on from the Brexit vote, little progress has been made on the issue. Former Irish premier Bertie Ahern told Sky News ""there is no realistic solution that has been put forward"". ""I really worry that the issue has not been examined to the extent that it requires, looking at the legal and constitutional issues and the trade ramifications,"" he said. ""A year has gone by and very little has happened."""

Mr Trump said of neighbourhoods plagued by gang violence: ""When you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, and I said: 'Please don't be too nice.' ""Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over, like, don't hit their head and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head, I said: 'You can take the hand away, okay?'"" Mr Trump offered no details on when and where he would have made those comments. His remarks prompted some laughter, cheers and applause from the police officers at Suffolk County Community College in Long Island, New York. The local police force later appeared to distance itself from Mr Trump's comments, tweeting: ""As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners."" As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners. A Florida police force later rounded on the President, tweeting: ""The @POTUS made remarks today that endorsed and condoned police brutality. ""GPD rejects these remarks and continues to serve with respect."" The @POTUS made remarks today that endorsed and condoned police brutality. GPD rejects these remarks and continues to serve with respect. Mr Trump had travelled to a crime-afflicted neighbourhood to magnify the threat from gangs, including the largely Salvadoran MS-13, which has killed 17 people in the last 18 months. ""They kidnap, they extort, they rape and they rob,"" Mr Trump said, using language unusual for a US president. ""They prey on children. They shouldn't be here. They stomp on their victims. They beat them with clubs. They slash them with machetes. And they stab them with knives."" He also described an urban hell where ""animals"" gang members had ""butchered"" little girls, and ""transformed peaceful parks and beautiful, quiet neighbourhoods into blood-stained killing fields"". His vow to all ""criminal aliens"" was: ""We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you and we will deport you."" The Black Lives Matter campaign responded by re-posting a message on Twitter that read: ""Dear @realDonaldTrump, Police are supposed to protect us. Not hurt us. We won't stop until we live in a world free from police brutality."" Dear @realDonaldTrump,Police are supposed to protect us. Not hurt us. We won’t stop until we live in a world free from police brutality. Ahead of Mr Trump's speech, the American Civil Liberties Union had accused the President of exercising a ""cynical ploy"" to ""cast aspersions on entire communities and push his anti-immigrant agenda"". It said: ""Trump's vile rhetoric and cruel deportation machine mean that vulnerable immigrants must fear both gangs and the government at once."""

The missile may have flown higher than 3,000km (1,864 miles), a Japanese defence official told state media. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency meeting to discuss the launch, which he said showed the ""grave and real"" threat posed by Pyongyang. He said: ""As long as North Korea continues such provocative actions, there is no avoiding maintaining close contact with the international community - starting with the United States, South Korea, China and Russia - and further strengthening the pressure."" The launch comes less than a month after the reclusive state tested its first long-range missile, which was allegedly capable of carrying a ""large, heavy nuclear warhead"". Analysts said the ""landmark"" Hwasong-14 missile, which flew for around 40 minutes, could reach Alaska. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson described the test as a ""new escalation of threat"" to the world, while President Trump called on China to ""put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all"".

But as darkness fell, parts of the barricade were set on fire and riot police moved in. Angry clashes broke out at around 10pm, as scores of missiles were launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group. Restaurants and bars pulled down their shutters, locking customers inside, as the protesters were pushed down Kingsland High Street and beyond Dalston Kingsland Station. The violence appeared to have been dispersed shortly after 11pm but shattered glass littered the streets and a helicopter continued to circle above. A few hours earlier, protesters jumped onto a lorry which drove through and clung to its wing mirrors as it hit the bins lined up in its path. A man sat on one bin, which was pushed along by the vehicle, while another clambered on to its roof as it continued to drive. It eventually came to a stop, with its window and windscreen smashed, but left the scene after the driver spoke to police. :: Anger grows over death of young father Rashan Charles The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the events leading to the death of Mr Charles on Saturday 22 July. Unverified footage on social media appeared to show at least one police officer attempting to restrain him on the floor of a shop at 1.45am, close to where the protest was held. Scotland Yard said after entering the shop, Mr Charles was seen ""trying to swallow an object"" and was then taken ill. The 20-year-old later died in hospital. The IPCC said in a statement on Friday: ""We understand the concerns raised following Rashan's death. ""We will independently examine the circumstances of this incident, we will follow the evidence, we will consider whether there is an indication there may have been misconduct or criminality, and we will seek to answer the questions that Rashan's family and the community of Hackney understandably have."""

But critics argue that it could lead to an increase in drug use. David Raynes of the National Drug Prevention Alliance told Sky News: ""This normalises drug taking. Some people go to festivals for the first time and take drugs for the first time. ""The drugs they take will not be drugs that have been tested because during the testing process the drugs get destroyed so there will be other drugs available to them. ""Testing doesn't make the drugs that people might take at a festival safe."" One man, who did not want to be identified, brought an ecstasy tablet for examination. Results showed that it was pure. He said: ""I read some bad reports about the pills as well as some good ones, so I decided it would be best for me that I have the reassurance in my mind to know that I've come here, have it tested and know for sure. ""It just gives me peace of mind to know that what I'm taking is safe instead of just taking anything."" :: 'Chemsex' drugs targeted in crackdown:: Campaigners call for digital cannabis market The testing comes after a number of drug-related deaths at UK festivals in recent years. In 2015, Christian Pay died after taking a ecstasy table at Kendal Calling festival in Cumbria. The 18-year-old was rushed to hospital having taken a blue tablet that police later said had led to the hospitalisation of several other people. Three men were eventually convicted for selling the drug. Six festivals, including Reading and Leeds, are to allow on-site drug testing this year in a attempt to highlight potentially lethal batches of drugs."

Hughes claimed the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was dealing heroin and cocaine and owned a replica gun. Manchester Crown Court heard he anonymously made 20 false reports to Crimestoppers in 2014 and 2015, alleging that the father of two was dealing drugs. He also made 15 false allegations to the NSPCC. Some of the reports were made as Hughes sat at his police desk in Liverpool. Hughes passed on false intelligence to colleagues and social workers which led to the man being stopped, searched and questioned by police. However, the court heard that authorities realised the reports were malicious and untrue. Hughes, who has dyslexia, was found out when he forged documents to be used in court purporting to be from his Chief Superintendent and Superintendent. However, he spelled their ranks wrong. Hughes, who had been a police officer for 12 years, was arrested and suspended from his job in December 2015. Duncan Bould, prosecuting, told the court that the letters and the other reports ""bore the significant hallmarks of poor spelling and grammatical errors"". Hughes also had a habit of putting capital letters in the middle of words due to his dyslexia. Defence solicitor John Parry-Jones said Hughes suffered from an undiagnosed borderline personality disorder which made him engage in impulsive and risky behaviour. However, the judge said that although Hughes' condition explained some of his ""extraordinary conduct"", he had no alternative but to send him to prison for three years and four months. Hughes had admitted to two charges - perverting the course of justice and forgery - at an earlier hearing. He has also been dismissed by Merseyside Police."

2017-07-28,Legal pressure has forced the Government to get tough on air pollution - but its latest phased and targeted plan hasn't pleased everyone.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170729095308/http://news.sky.com/story/clever-politics-in-the-governments-car-pollution-solution-10962694,"There is an acknowledgement that pinpointing specific roads around the country, where levels of nitrogen dioxide are at their highest, is better than a quick national fix which could penalise drivers. But councils worry the £255m being allocated by Westminster won't be enough to help them tackle the problems, especially given tightening budgets. Added to that, stripping away traffic calming measures to reduce cars braking and accelerating (which doubles exhaust emissions) could also compromise road safety: speed bumps on roads by schools, for example, are there for a reason. But while Greenpeace says ""real solutions, not gimmicks"" are required, the proposals are designed to both satisfy legal requirements (after a court deemed the Government's record on reducing air pollution to be so poor as to be illegal under EU rules) and phase in changes so the car industry is not alarmed. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has warned an outright ban on petrol and diesel cars could ""undermine the UK's automotive sector"", which employs 800,000 people and is already exhibiting nervousness over the possible impact of Brexit. But the Government's decision to consult on plans for a targeted scrappage scheme for polluting vehicles this autumn is designed to allay industry fears, while also allowing local authorities to come up with their own trade-in alternatives. So there is also some clever politics here. The Government has passed the onus of sorting out these pollution hotspots to local authorities, while pushing any ban on ""traditional"" diesel and petrol cars down the road until 2040. Environment Secretary Michael Gove can argue he's given car manufacturers plenty of notice, by which time technology could have made electric vehicles cheaper to produce anyway. He has also put pressure on councils to deal with the immediate concerns of poor air quality and kicked the controversial issue of scrappage into consultation while trailing next year's more comprehensive Clear Air Strategy. Environmentalists were never going to be happy with the speed and scope of Wednesday's plans, but there's enough to neuter any damaging criticism at the start of Parliament's summer break."

We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him! Mr Priebus' future had been put into question earlier on Thursday, when comments made by Anthony Scaramucci - the new White House communications chief - were published in the American press. During a phonecall with New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza on Wednesday night, Mr Scaramucci badmouthed the former chief of staff, saying that Mr Priebus had ""c***-blocked"" and orchestrated leaks against him. Mr Scaramucci's colourful turn of phrase appears to have been accusing Mr Priebus of obstructing his success in Mr Trump's White House administration. During the expletive-laden rant, the newly appointed director of communications also rubbished the White House chief strategist, saying: ""I'm not Steve Bannon. I'm not trying to suck my own c***"". The slur seeks to imply Mr Bannon places his own interests before those of the White House. The communications chief is also believed to have had an intense rivalry with Sean Spicer, who resigned as press secretary when Mr Scaramucci was hired by Mr Trump a week ago. Mr Trump was swift to announce the replacement for his chief of staff, tweeting: ""I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American and a Great Leader. ""John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration.""

I think it's time to hit the reset button. ""He intuitively determined that it was time to do something different, and I think he's right... ""I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the President's agenda and policies. ""I can't think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God's blessings and great success.""

Southwark Crown Court heard Rene Tkacik, 43, from Slovakia, died after being crushed by falling wet concrete in March 2014. Two other men were injured in separate incidents within six days of one another in January 2015. On 16 January 2015 Terence 'Ian' Hughes was struck by a reversing excavator, suffering severe fractures to his right leg and injuring his left knee and shin. Six days later Alex Vizitiu, who was part of a team spraying liquid concrete lining, was helping with the cleaning of the pipes that supply the concrete when one of the lines became disconnected and he was hit by pressurised water and concrete debris. He suffered head and hip injuries as well as a broken finger and was in hospital for six days. All three incidents took place in the tunnels around the Fisher Street area of central London. In relation to the death of Mr Tkacik, BFK was fined £300,000. It was fined a further £600,000 for the incident involving Mr Hughes, and £165,000 for the incident relating to Mr Vizitiu. On top of the fine totalling £1,065,000, the consortium was ordered to pay costs of £42,337.28. HSE head of operations Annette Hall said: ""The omission to implement exclusion zones in a high-hazard environment was a consistent failure in this case. ""Had simple measures such as these been taken, all three incidents could have been prevented, and Rene Tkacik may not have died. ""We believe every person should be healthy and safe at work. Here, all three workers were taking part in one of the most important and challenging infrastructure projects of the decade. ""It was this joint venture's duty to protect its dedicated and highly skilled workforce. On these three occasions, BFK failed in its duty, with tragic consequences for Rene Tkacik and his family."""

That's less than half the rate one might previously have considered normal. :: Sluggish growth continues for economy That weak growth, as the Chancellor told me, is partly down to Brexit - the nervousness faced by businesses and consumers, unsure of our future relationship with the EU and unwilling to invest as much as they would have done. And yet, despite wanting to tell businesses that they will have a transition period - something to ease the shift from being inside to being outside the EU - he simply can't. In his words, he ""can't give a cast iron guarantee"" - because Britain has yet to agree to a transition with its European counterparts. It is an invidious situation. On the bright side, the UK economy is not mired in the recession some economists feared after the referendum. But annual growth of less than 2%, which is what the IMF now expects for the UK, implies Britons feeling the pinch for many more months. Indeed, having been the industrialised world's fastest growing economy before the vote, it is now one of the weaker performers. And yet because government has been effectively paralysed by Brexit, and because the negotiations are only now creaking into action, there is little he can do to try to relieve that uncertainty. No wonder he told me that talks over the so-called ""implementation period"" should be the first thing on the agenda in Brussels. Still, it's a reminder of how much things have changed for UK economic policymaking in the past few months. Remember: Britain has plenty of challenges not related to Europe. Productivity is weak - real wages were squeezed well before one considers the post-vote period - and there are worries that the UK is punching below its weight on innovation and industrial policy. And yet because of the referendum - and then June's election - the Chancellor has little realistic prospect of imposing major reforms on the UK economy. He can't even guarantee the implementation period he and business want - despite having (eventually) persuaded his Brexiteer cabinet colleagues that it's necessary. A tough spot to be in. Then again, no one said this would be easy."

The rigorous checks were ordered after at least 80 people died at Grenfell Tower in west London on 14 June. Flammable cladding, combined with insulation, was widely blamed for spreading the fire quickly up the 24-storey building. The new ""whole system"" test examines the combination of cladding and insulation in conjunction to see how they react to different types of fire. It is considered a more comprehensive assessment following a wave of tests which saw hundreds of cladding samples fail standards for flammability in recent months. Police investigating the Grenfell disaster said this week that there are grounds to suspect corporate manslaughter may have been committed. The Department for Communities and Local Government said the disaster ""raised serious questions"" about fire safety, centred on the use of flammable cladding in tower blocks. The independent review, to be led by Dame Judith Hackitt, will look particularly at high-rise residential buildings, including fire safety regulations related to their construction, design and management. A final report is expected by spring 2018 and an interim report by the end of this year. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""It's clear we need to urgently look at building regulations and fire safety. ""This independent review will ensure we can swiftly make any necessary improvements. The Government is determined to make sure that we learn the lessons from the Grenfell Tower fire, and to ensure nothing like it can happen again."" Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said the tragedy had exposed a systemic failure of the current system of building regulation and welcomed news of the review."

In a statement, his mother Connie Yates said: ""Our beautiful little boy has gone, we are so proud of you Charlie."" GOSH said everyone at the hospital ""sends their heartfelt condolences to Charlie's parents and loved ones at this very sad time"". Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""deeply saddened"" and that her ""thoughts and prayers"" are with the family. Born a ""perfectly healthy"" baby on 4 August last year, Charlie's fight against a rare inherited disease generated headlines around the world. His parents' legal bid to transfer their son from GOSH to the US for experimental treatment attracted the support of both the Pope and President Trump. But, with UK courts consistently agreeing with Charlie's doctors that keeping him on life support was not in his best interests, his mother and father ended their high-profile legal battle on Monday. :: Timeline - Parents' battle to save Charlie Gard Connie Yates and Chris Gard lost a subsequent High Court bid to secure their son several days of life-support treatment, with GOSH describing their plans as not ""in any way viable"". Ms Yates said she was ""shocked"" by the ruling, adding that GOSH had ""denied us our final wish"". Charlie is believed to have been only the 16th person to ever be diagnosed with infantile onset encephalomyopathy mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS). His condition meant he had a decreased number of the cells needed for respiration and energy production in muscles, the liver and brain. Charlie could not move his arms or legs, was only able to breathe through a ventilator, had deafness and suffered severe epilepsy. After finding an American doctor willing to offer the boy experimental treatment, Ms Yates set up a crowdfunding page in January in order to pay for the trial therapy. After attracting celebrity backing and widespread support on social media, the ""Charlie's Fight"" campaign went on to raise more than £1.3m through donations from more than 84,000 people. However, in April, a High Court judge agreed with GOSH that the experimental treatment was ""very unlikely"" to work and ruled doctors could withdraw all treatment except end-of-life care in the ""best interests"" of Charlie. Charlie's parents launched unsuccessful appeals all the way up to the Supreme Court and failed to convince European judges to take on the case. Their fight returned to the High Court in early July, so judge Mr Justice Francis could consider any new evidence. During the hearing, Ms Yates broke down as the parents were told by a GOSH representative that a new scan on their son made for ""sad reading"". Paying tribute to their son following the end of their legal challenge on Monday, Ms Yates and Mr Gard described him as an ""absolute warrior"". Mr Gard said: ""Mummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn't save you. ""We had the chance but we weren't allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight our beautiful little boy."""

There was another breakthrough a day later, when footage showed Dorsett storming into another shop and grabbing the till. Two women fought in vain to stop him running towards the exit and one of them struck him with a baseball bat. A spate of muggings had also been reported at Newtown shopping centre, prompting police to step up patrols. On 5 February, he was spotted and arrested following a violent struggle. It later emerged that he had also robbed a 66-year-old man four times, with the victim moving out of his flat in fear that he would be targeted again. Although he went to live with a friend, Dorsett tracked him down and robbed him a fifth time. In another case, he also snatched a purse from a Good Samaritan who had gone to help Dorsett after seeing him trip in the street. At Birmingham Crown Court, he admitted committing a total of 15 robberies and also pleaded guilty to one count of assault with intent to rob. Dorsett has been sentenced to 12 years in prison. PC Sherrie Watkins said: ""Dorsett is a dangerous man - a bully who thinks nothing about carrying a knife in public and using it to threaten vulnerable people.

It's no life in a hotel. We've got only two rooms. ""I have three daughters. One of them sleeps on the floor and the other two sleep in the bed. They change sometimes. So this is not life. We are waiting for answers. When are we going to be rehoused?"" :: Manslaughter charges possible over Grenfell blaze Maher is a Grenfell survivor. And his question has been asked every day since 14 June, when the fatal fire swept through the 24-storey tower block in west London. Maher lost friends and neighbours in the disaster. He was woken by one of his daughters who smelled the smoke as it rose up through the building. Maher hobbled down 13 flights of stairs with his family to safety. They stood on the street and looked on helplessly as the fire destroyed everything they owned. Since then Maher has been living in this four-star hotel just behind Kensington High Street. The lobby is full of international tourists making happy memories of their holiday in London. Their lives are so far removed from fellow hotel guests like Maher. He is not the only Grenfell survivor being temporarily accommodated here. The rooms are comfortable but a little cramped for a family of four - especially because they have been here for almost two months already. Maher has been offered a property. But one that was completely unsuitable for his needs. :: 82 tower blocks fail new fire check ""I know nothing until now. Only once someone called me from Westminster City Council and they offered me a house on Harrow Road. I asked them to send me the address. ""When they sent it to me I googled it.

He knows he gave me the wrong place to stay so he didn't call me again."" Maher has polio in both legs. He contracted the virus as a child when he was growing up in Syria. He is completely dependant on crutches to move around. He told me: ""Nobody has talked to me about my disability."" Maher has lived in Britain for 16 years. He moved to Grenfell Tower about three-and-a half years ago. Just six months ago his wife and three children finally came to London to join him, Maher says, after years of persuasion. They lived in Damascus and survived the war. Maher managed to convince them to start a new life in London away from the bombings. He convinced them they would ""be safe and happy"" here with him. But now one nightmare has been replaced by another. They brought with them everything they owned. All their possessions, a lifetime of memories and mementos, went up in flames. They have nothing left of their life before the fire. Maher's wife is recovering from cancer and one of his daughters has a spinal deformity which has recently been operated on. Now the youngest has withdrawn into a world of silence - her way of coping with the devastation of last month. Maher says: ""When she is at school she is OK. When she comes home she just sits alone not talking to anybody."" He tells me she wakes up regularly suffering from nightmares. In her mind the fire is still raging. ""I need a place I can feel comfortable. Where the transport is not too far. So I can go for shopping. ""My wife has cancer - she needs to go to the hospital. She wants to see her doctor. ""It's hard for me to go far to get what they need. I sometimes use my taxi card. But that is expensive. After only 10 journeys per month it's gone. ""We need a place to feel safe.

In a statement, his mother Connie Yates said: ""Our beautiful little boy has gone, we are so proud of you Charlie."" GOSH said everyone at the hospital ""sends their heartfelt condolences to Charlie's parents and loved ones at this very sad time"". :: Pope leads tributes to 'little Charlie'  It’s with great sadness that we have to inform you that Charlie passed away earlier this afternoon. Connie has released a brief statement: ‘Our beautiful, little boy has gone. We are so proud of you, Charlie.’ We ask that everyone respects the family’s privacy at this difficult time, but we would all like to say a huge thank you to everyone for your continued support. 💙💙💙 A post shared by #charliesfight (@charliesfight) on Jul 28, 2017 at 11:48am PDT Born a ""perfectly healthy"" baby on 4 August last year, Charlie's fight against a rare inherited disease generated headlines around the world. His parents' legal bid to transfer their son from GOSH to the US for experimental treatment attracted the support of both the Pope and President Trump. But, with UK courts consistently agreeing with Charlie's doctors that keeping him on life support was not in his best interests, his mother and father ended their high-profile legal battle on Monday. :: Timeline - Parents' battle to save Charlie Gard Connie Yates and Chris Gard lost a subsequent High Court bid to secure their son several days of life-support treatment, with GOSH describing their plans as not ""in any way viable"". Ms Yates said she was ""shocked"" by the ruling, adding that GOSH had ""denied us our final wish"". Charlie is believed to have been only the 16th person to ever be diagnosed with infantile onset encephalomyopathy mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS). His condition meant he had a decreased number of the cells needed for respiration and energy production in muscles, the liver and brain. Charlie could not move his arms or legs, was only able to breathe through a ventilator, had deafness and suffered severe epilepsy. After finding an American doctor willing to offer the boy experimental treatment, Ms Yates set up a crowdfunding page in January in order to pay for the trial therapy. After attracting celebrity backing and widespread support on social media, the ""Charlie's Fight"" campaign went on to raise more than £1.3m through donations from more than 84,000 people. However, in April, a High Court judge agreed with GOSH that the experimental treatment was ""very unlikely"" to work and ruled doctors could withdraw all treatment except end-of-life care in the ""best interests"" of Charlie. Charlie's parents launched unsuccessful appeals all the way up to the Supreme Court and failed to convince European judges to take on the case. Their fight returned to the High Court in early July, so judge Mr Justice Francis could consider any new evidence. During the hearing, Ms Yates broke down as the parents were told by a GOSH representative that a new scan on their son made for ""sad reading"". Paying tribute to their son following the end of their legal challenge on Monday, Ms Yates and Mr Gard described him as an ""absolute warrior"". Mr Gard said: ""Mummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn't save you. ""We had the chance but we weren't allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight our beautiful little boy."""

Canada's York Regional Police said a Chevy Cobalt and a Ford F550 collided in the Vaughan area of the city just before 6am on Thursday. A police spokesman said the Chevy driver died of his injuries, but the other driver was not hurt. Essex-born Anker had reportedly moved to Canada to live with his fiancee after forging a successful career. He performed with Diversity when they won Britain's Got Talent in 2009 and worked alongside artists such as Paloma Faith and Peter Andre. He also starred in the West End's production of Thriller. A Just Giving page set up in his name has appealed for funds to support his family. It reads: ""On 27th July 2017, Robert Anker aged 27 was involved in a fatal car accident in Canada and sadly passed away at the scene. ""We are raising funds for his family to be able to cover all costs for their trip to go and arrange his funeral in Canada. ""We would love to ensure that his family don't worry or stress about money at this time."" It has so far raised more than £4,100. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of the death of a British man in Canada. We are providing assistance to his family at this time."""

That's less than half the rate one might previously have considered normal. :: Sluggish growth continues for economy That weak growth, as the Chancellor told me, is partly down to Brexit - the nervousness faced by businesses and consumers, unsure of our future relationship with the EU and unwilling to invest as much as they would have done. And yet, despite wanting to tell businesses that they will have a transition period - something to ease the shift from being inside to being outside the EU - he simply can't. In his words, he ""can't give a cast iron guarantee"" - because Britain has yet to agree to a transition with its European counterparts. It is an invidious situation. On the bright side, the UK economy is not mired in the recession some economists feared after the referendum. But annual growth of less than 2%, which is what the IMF now expects for the UK, implies Britons feeling the pinch for many more months. Indeed, having been the industrialised world's fastest growing economy before the vote, it is now one of the weaker performers. And yet because government has been effectively paralysed by Brexit, and because the negotiations are only now creaking into action, there is little he can do to try to relieve that uncertainty. No wonder he told me that talks over the so-called ""implementation period"" should be the first thing on the agenda in Brussels. Still, it's a reminder of how much things have changed for UK economic policymaking in the past few months. Remember: Britain has plenty of challenges not related to Europe. Productivity is weak - real wages were squeezed well before one considers the post-vote period - and there are worries that the UK is punching below its weight on innovation and industrial policy. And yet because of the referendum - and then June's election - the Chancellor has little realistic prospect of imposing major reforms on the UK economy. He can't even guarantee the implementation period he and business want - despite having (eventually) persuaded his Brexiteer cabinet colleagues that it's necessary. A tough spot to be in. Then again, no one said this would be easy."

The service promises users they won't be arrested if they bring their drugs for testing. Organisers claim to have found crushed up malaria medication, insecticide and even concrete in pills being sold. Professor Fiona Measham, director of The Loop, said the charity was offering a ""pragmatic, harm reduction initiative"". ""We accept that some people will get drugs on site and some people will be planning to take them so what we're doing is trying to address any potential health problems. ""This is a focus on public health rather than on criminal justice."" About one in five users ask the charity to dispose of substances after they have been tested, Prof Measham said. But critics argue that it could lead to an increase in drug use. David Raynes of the National Drug Prevention Alliance told Sky News: ""This normalises drug taking. Some people go to festivals for the first time and take drugs for the first time. ""The drugs they take will not be drugs that have been tested because during the testing process the drugs get destroyed so there will be other drugs available to them. ""Testing doesn't make the drugs that people might take at a festival safe."" One man, who did not want to be identified, brought an ecstasy tablet for examination. Results showed that it was pure. He said: ""I read some bad reports about the pills as well as some good ones, so I decided it would be best for me that I have the reassurance in my mind to know that I've come here, have it tested and know for sure. ""It just gives me peace of mind to know that what I'm taking is safe instead of just taking anything."" :: 'Chemsex' drugs targeted in crackdown:: Campaigners call for digital cannabis market The testing comes after a number of drug-related deaths at UK festivals in recent years. In 2015, Christian Pay died after taking a ecstasy table at Kendal Calling festival in Cumbria. The 18-year-old was rushed to hospital having taken a blue tablet that police later said had led to the hospitalisation of several other people. Three men were eventually convicted for selling the drug. Six festivals, including Reading and Leeds, are to allow on-site drug testing this year in a attempt to highlight potentially lethal batches of drugs."

More than 500,000 customers have placed deposits for the vehicles, which will now be produced at a rate of 5,000 a week, increasing to 10,000 a week next year. Tesla founder Elon Musk called the Model 3 ""the best car for its cost, either electric or gasoline"", and called the achievement a major step towards the aim of an electric car ""that everyone can buy"". :: Analysis: Inventing electric cars is easy - now UK needs to reshape itself The new vehicles will market at around £27,000 ($35,000), significantly cheaper than the £60,000 ($80,000) price tag of Tesla's current S and X models. Mr Musk said revenue from the more expensive models has funded the new line. Smaller than its higher-range predecessors and with fewer options, the Model 3 still comes equipped with on-board computers that Mr Musk says prepare it for a self-driving future. But he added that coordinating thousands of parts from global suppliers meant that even small mishaps could cause delays to his ambitious targets. :: Volvo to make only electric or hybrid cars from 2019 ""Welcome to production hell,"" he quipped at Friday's launch. ""This is where we are for at least six months."" The majority of the vehicle's first buyers are Tesla employees. Many ordering the Model 3 have been told not to expect their cars until next year. While the high volume of orders has it tipped as a game-changer, the Model 3 is not the first affordable electric car on the market. GM's Bolt model also sells at $35,000, but poor sales have recently prompted a pause in its production. Mr Musk, an internationally renowned tech entrepreneur, also runs projects building rechargeable batteries to power homes, sending paying customers to the moon, and designing near-supersonic rail travel. The impressive sales of the Model 3 could mark a breakthrough for Tesla and electric cars, which until now have comprised only a small portion of the auto market. Gene Munster, an analyst with research firm Loup Ventures, said Tesla could transform the industry. ""We believe we will eventually look back at the launch of the Model 3 and compare it to the iPhone, which proved to be the catalyst for the shift to mobile computing,"" he said."

The Scotch whisky industry is worth £4bn to Scotland and it is protected from sub-standard products by an EU definition of whisky - but this will change after our European divorce. Scottish economy secretary Keith Brown said: ""Aside from being a key part of Scottish culture and identity, our whisky industry supports around 20,000 jobs. ""The US made clear in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership discussions that they would support a relaxation of the definition of whisky, which would open the market up to a number of products which do not currently meet that standard. ""Whisky is a product which is worth around £4bn to Scotland in exports. ""It is vital that we continue to have robust legal protection of Scotch whisky, which is why I have sought clarification from the UK Government as to whether Scotch whisky featured in discussions during last week's trade visit (to the US) by the Secretary of State for International Trade. ""I am also demanding that the current EU regulations are guaranteed post-Brexit."" Under the EU's definition, all whisky produced or sold in the EU must, among other things, be matured for at least three years. A spokesman for the UK Government said: ""Scotch is a UK export success story and we will support the industry so that it continues to thrive and prosper post-Brexit. ""The UK Government has a strong relationship with the Scotch Whisky Association and is working closely with the industry as we aim to secure the best possible deal for the whole of the UK."""

A donor was found just in time. Her name was Rhona, a 33-year-old who suffered a brain haemorrhage just days after giving birth to a baby girl. Having made a full recovery, Lisa thought she would make contact with her donor's loved-ones in a letter. Soon afterwards she travelled to their home in Scotland to meet Rhona's mother, Jane Moffat, and her stepdad John. She told Sky News: ""Instantly, when we met, me and Jane, we just hugged. It felt like for hours. We both just cried and as soon as I met them I just loved them. We didn't feel any awkwardness, it was just like we were family."" But that was not the end of this story. Lisa had found love once again in her life and had accepted a proposal of marriage from her partner Jim. With plans in full swing for the big day, Lisa found herself with a dilemma. Her father had died a few years earlier and there was no one else suitable in her family to walk her down the aisle and give her away - but then she had an idea. ""I wondered if my donor's family, if her stepdad would give me away. So I phoned Jane and she said ring him and ask him and I did and he said yes, and I just can't wait. It's going to be a really special, sad but special, exciting day."" Mr Moffat told Sky News: ""I've had the privilege of being asked to give her away at her forthcoming wedding which I think is an excellent honour. I will have great pleasure in doing so and I'm really looking forward to doing so."" The Moffats travelled to Lanarkshire to support Lisa as she took part in this year's annual Transplant Games. These have been held every year since 1978 to encourage transplant recipients to exercise, but also to raise awareness of the NHS Organ Donor Register, and to try to persuade members of the public to sign up to it. There are 20 million people on the register who have done just that, but even so three people die every year while waiting for a transplant. Campaigners say that agreeing to make organs available in the event of death is an act of selflessness that can and does change the lives of others beyond all recognition. Lives like those of Lisa Shrive, busy planning her wedding day, and Jane Moffat, who said: ""I feel, in Lisa, Rhona's still alive in some way. I feel she's here today."""
2017-07-29,Legal pressure has forced the Government to get tough on air pollution - but its latest phased and targeted plan hasn't pleased everyone.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170730102734/http://news.sky.com/story/clever-politics-in-the-governments-car-pollution-solution-10962694,"There is an acknowledgement that pinpointing specific roads around the country, where levels of nitrogen dioxide are at their highest, is better than a quick national fix which could penalise drivers. But councils worry the £255m being allocated by Westminster won't be enough to help them tackle the problems, especially given tightening budgets. Added to that, stripping away traffic calming measures to reduce cars braking and accelerating (which doubles exhaust emissions) could also compromise road safety: speed bumps on roads by schools, for example, are there for a reason. But while Greenpeace says ""real solutions, not gimmicks"" are required, the proposals are designed to both satisfy legal requirements (after a court deemed the Government's record on reducing air pollution to be so poor as to be illegal under EU rules) and phase in changes so the car industry is not alarmed. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has warned an outright ban on petrol and diesel cars could ""undermine the UK's automotive sector"", which employs 800,000 people and is already exhibiting nervousness over the possible impact of Brexit. But the Government's decision to consult on plans for a targeted scrappage scheme for polluting vehicles this autumn is designed to allay industry fears, while also allowing local authorities to come up with their own trade-in alternatives. So there is also some clever politics here. The Government has passed the onus of sorting out these pollution hotspots to local authorities, while pushing any ban on ""traditional"" diesel and petrol cars down the road until 2040. Environment Secretary Michael Gove can argue he's given car manufacturers plenty of notice, by which time technology could have made electric vehicles cheaper to produce anyway. He has also put pressure on councils to deal with the immediate concerns of poor air quality and kicked the controversial issue of scrappage into consultation while trailing next year's more comprehensive Clear Air Strategy. Environmentalists were never going to be happy with the speed and scope of Wednesday's plans, but there's enough to neuter any damaging criticism at the start of Parliament's summer break."

Thames Valley Police said the machine had now been stabilised but it could be some days before it is removed from the scene as expert engineers are brought in from the Netherlands. Superintendent Robert France said firefighters worked with others to stabilise the machine. ""The crane has now been stabilised and the fire service has left the scene; however, TVP and Reading Borough Council remain at the scene,"" he said.

Mr Fox is at odds with Chancellor Philip Hammond, who said on Friday that there was a ""broad acceptance"" in Cabinet that free movement would end in name only for three years after Brexit, as part of a transition deal with the European Union. Mr Hammond said there would be a registration system in place for people coming to work in the UK after Brexit. ""If they come here to work after we leave the European Union, during that transitional period, the sensible approach will be to seek to register people so that we know who's coming and who's going,"" he said. But in an interview conducted on Monday last week for The Sunday Times, Dr Fox said that any such move would ""not keep faith"" with the referendum result. He told the newspaper: ""If there have been discussions on that I have not been party to them. I have not been involved in any discussions on that."" Mr Cable said the latest clash ""reveals a deep, unbridgeable chasm between the Brexit fundamentalist and the pragmatists"". ""Businesses which might have hoped that Philip Hammond had pulled the Government back from a commitment to a catastrophic cliff edge, crashing out of the EU, have been misled,"" said the Lib Dem. ""There is no Cabinet consensus for moderation. And the rumours of Boris Johnson being about to resign fuel the uncertainty,"" he added. The war of words come as an ally of the Foreign Secretary also criticised Mr Hammond's plans. Gerard Lyons, who was an economic adviser to Mr Johnson when he was London mayor, said a two-year transition period would work better. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, he said: ""Many of the 'risks' being highlighted about Brexit are perceived risks, not real risks. And a two-year transition would alleviate many concerns."" Mr Johnson has not yet commented publicly on Mr Hammond's transition plans. Meanwhile, the Luxembourg PM has warned that Britain could have to pay a Brexit divorce bill of up to £54bn. Xavier Bettel compared the EU stance to Margaret Thatcher's bitter battle to get a major rebate for the UK in the 1980s. ""It is now time for the European Union to make an analogy with the famous quote of Mrs Thatcher, 'We want our money back',"" he told The Mail on Sunday. ""Concerning the exit bill, it is important to underline that the British government took this commitment in the past and needs to honour it. It is not a penalty. ""The sum ranges between £36bn and £54bn."" Mr Bettel accused Mr Johnson of ""bragging"" when he claimed Britain could have its cake and eat it over Brexit. He said: ""It is not possible to have your cake and eat it too - Boris Johnson knows that."""

The efforts overnight have been very effective but there's more work to do."" He said security had been increased at all major international and domestic airports around Australia. Officials did not specify if the plot targeted a domestic or international flight, but Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported that ""a local route"" had been the objective. The four men held after a series of raids across Sydney on Saturday were allegedly linked to an ""Islamic-inspired"" plot, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said. ""In recent days, law enforcement has become aware of information that suggested some people in Sydney were planning to commit a terrorist attack using an improvised device,"" he said. ""We are investigating information indicating the aviation industry was potentially a target of that attack."" Local media reported that 40 riot squad officers wearing gas masks stormed a Sydney house before an explosives team found a suspicious device. Mr Colvin added that several items ""of great interest to police"" had been seized in the raids, but the investigation was expected to be ""long and protracted"". Travellers have been advised to arrive at Australian airports earlier than usual - two hours before departure - to allow for extra security screening. The national terror alert remains unchanged at ""probable"". Canberra lifted the alert level in September 2014 and introduced new national security laws amid rising concerns over attacks by individuals inspired by organisations such as Islamic State. Since that time 70 suspects have been charged in 31 counter-terrorism police operations, according to the justice ministry."

Experts said trajectory of the rocket fired by Pyongyang, which landed in the Sea of Japan, indicated major cities across the US were now within range. Mr Johnson said: ""The UK strongly condemns North Korea's second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile and calls on the regime to immediately stop all activity that breaches UN Security Council resolutions.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who personally supervised the launch of the missile on Friday night, said the launch served as a ""stern warning"" for the US, according to the North's official KCNA news agency. It is the second ICBM launch in less than a month by the North, despite international efforts to curb the development of missile technology by the nuclear-armed authoritarian state. US President Donald Trump said: ""By threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people.

Expanding on his idea, he told the paper: ""For it to have credibility with the British public, there would have to be a Labour manifesto offer, because the public would say, not unreasonably, 'Hold on a sec, we voted to leave and you're now sticking two fingers up at us'."" Mr Khan's position appears to be at odds with the Labour leadership. In its recent manifesto, Labour said it ""accepts the referendum result"". Jeremy Corbyn has indicated a Labour government would take Britain out of the EU single market because being in it is ""dependent on membership of the EU"". Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, however, has said nothing is off the table. Mr Khan added that if Labour were to adopt an anti-Brexit position, it would need to be clear. ""You'd have to spell out,"" he said, ""in black and white, what we'd do if we won the general election. ""What could trump the referendum result is us having a manifesto offer saying we would not leave the EU, or we would have a second referendum."" In response to Mr Khan's comments, a Labour spokesperson said: ""Labour respects the result of the referendum and is making the case for a jobs-first Brexit, through securing full tariff-free access to the European single market."" Whatever the final form that Brexit actually takes, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said ""many things will look similar"" afterwards. Mr Hammond has indicated that a transitional arrangement could last for up to three years following the planned withdrawal date of March 2019."

Terrified revellers fled the music venue or hid as the shooter opened fire at about 4.30am (local time). The Iraqi gunman, 34, exchanged fire with police at the scene, eventually being shot. He was taken to hospital where he died. A police officer was also injured in the gunfight outside Club Grey in the southern German city of Konstanz. His injury is not thought to be life-threatening. Officials said special commando forces and helicopters had been deployed to the area. An investigation has been launched into the attack, the motive for which is unclear, but police have ruled out terrorism. ""We are still investigating but the circumstances surrounding the events at the disco in the evening before the shooting are a bit clearer and this led us to rule out a terrorism background,"" police spokesman Fritz Bezikofer told broadcaster n-tv. He added the Iraqi national suspect was not an asylum seeker. Sunday's shooting comes just two days after a knife attack in the northern German port city of Hamburg. A failed Palestinian asylum seeker killed one person and injured six others at a supermarket on Friday. Officials said the 26-year-old suspect suffered psychological problems and was ""known as an Islamist but not a jihadist""."

The Kurdistan Solidarity Campaign said: ""Unfortunately, Joe has gone on holiday to Turkey not realising the kind of state it has now become.

It is in connection with the first of two sexual assaults which happened within the space of a few hours. The initial attack took place in a secluded part of Birmingham's Witton railway station, not far from Aston Villa's football stadium, between 8pm on Tuesday and 2am on Wednesday. At around 2am on Wednesday, the girl left in a disorientated state via the station entrance and flagged down a vehicle. She was then raped a second time in the car that stopped. Police are still looking for a man in connection with the second attack. He is described as being about 5ft 6in and thickset with large biceps.

The streets teem with people. Venezuela's economic collapse is most keenly felt here. Everyone is poor on these streets, everyone. :: Venezuela power-grab fears as polls open The anti-government movement may have its roots in the middle classes, but it is here too. The barricades are up. Nightly they clash with the National Guard. A lady stopped me in the street and told me her home had been attacked, tear gas fired towards her windows, because she and her neighbours were chanting anti-government slogans. Activists claim the security forces are now targeting the homes of the opposition supporters to try and scare them off the streets. But the anger at the government and its plans to rewrite the constitution with a new assembly are very real; so they take to the streets every day. :: Who is Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro? Across the city men and women, some in masks, some happy to be seen, express the same views: that the election is unconstitutional and will not be accepted. ""This is illegal,"" Juan Vieda, manning a barricade, told me. ""They want to force us. They want to force this constitution on us and we don't want it. This will be bad and this will be bad for them,"" he said. Near the centre of Caracas, estates of social housing, adorned with images of Hugo Chavez who paid for them to be built, remain the bastions of government support. Publicly at least. State employees get free housing and food subsidies to live on. They depend on it. All are being bombarded with texts and calls telling them to vote or risk losing it all. All radio stations must simultaneously play pro-election adverts at specific times set by Nicolas Maduro's government. Government owned banks urge customers to vote. Managers of state-owned businesses must guarantee their staff turn out or lose their jobs. For workers in the private sector, the self-employed and the huge numbers of unemployed the threats are meaningless. Around 70% are against the election, called in order to create a new assembly more powerful than the relatively new existing parliament, which is anti-government. The new assembly will change the constitution and effectively create a one-party state. It is so unconstitutional that, led by the United States, most countries bordering or near to Venezuela have urged for the elections to be stopped, are threatening sanctions and have declared that the result will not be recognised. The point is that in the opposition areas nobody will vote as no opposition politicians are standing. They hope that a tiny turnout will expose the illegitimacy of the process. The government, however, controls the election returns. There is no independent oversight in this election. Many heroes of the opposition have emerged over the past few months, among them the Violinist of Caracas, Wuilly Arteaga, who played the national anthem on the front line as rubber bullets flew past him and tear gas enveloped him. He told me that his new-found fame was irrelevant and that he was on the streets to show support for the opposition until change comes. He played for Sky News. Shortly after his last rendition he was arrested and beaten across the head with his violin. Friends say he has lost the hearing in his right ear."

But as darkness fell, parts of the barricade were set on fire and riot police moved in. Angry clashes broke out at around 10pm, as scores of missiles were launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group. Restaurants and bars pulled down their shutters, locking customers inside, as the protesters were pushed down Kingsland High Street and beyond Dalston Kingsland Station. The violence appeared to have been dispersed shortly after 11pm but shattered glass littered the streets and a helicopter continued to circle above. A few hours earlier, protesters jumped onto a lorry which drove through and clung to its wing mirrors as it hit the bins lined up in its path. A man sat on one bin, which was pushed along by the vehicle, while another clambered on to its roof as it continued to drive. It eventually came to a stop, with its window and windscreen smashed, but left the scene after the driver spoke to police. :: Anger grows over death of young father Rashan Charles The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the events leading to the death of Mr Charles on Saturday 22 July. Unverified footage on social media appeared to show at least one police officer attempting to restrain him on the floor of a shop at 1.45am, close to where the protest was held. Scotland Yard said after entering the shop, Mr Charles was seen ""trying to swallow an object"" and was then taken ill. The 20-year-old later died in hospital. The IPCC said in a statement on Friday: ""We understand the concerns raised following Rashan's death.

When Diana confronted her husband about his infidelity, she says he replied: ""I refuse to be the only Prince of Wales who never had a mistress."" She also claims Prince Philip told Charles that if the marriage did not work out, he could go back to Camilla ""after five years"". :: William and Harry admit regret over rushed final call to Diana In another excerpt, Diana discusses going to see the Queen for advice. She says: ""So I went to the top lady, sobbing, and I said, 'What do I do? I'm coming to you, what do I do?' And she said 'I don't know what you should do. Charles is hopeless.' ""And that was it, and that was help."" Diana ridicules Charles' efforts to woo her. When she was staying with friends in Sussex, the Prince made an approach. ""He chatted me up,"" Diana says. ""He was like a bad rash. He was all over me and I thought, you know, 'Urgh'. Whereupon, he leapt upon me and started kissing me and everything, and I thought, 'Waaah! This is not what people do.'"" Diana and Charles met only 13 times before marrying. ""He wasn't consistent with his courting abilities,"" she says. ""He'd ring me every day for a week, then wouldn't speak to me for three weeks. Very odd."" Sex with Charles happened ""once every three weeks"" and apparently fizzled out six or seven years before the tapes were recorded. And her bulimia was common Royal knowledge, she says: ""Everybody knew about the bulimia in the family. And they all blamed the failure of the marriage on the bulimia and it's taken them time to think differently. ""I said I was rejected, I didn't think I was good enough for this family, so I took it out on myself. I could have gone to alcohol... I could have been anorexic... I chose to hurt myself instead of hurting all of you."" The Mail on Sunday reported that Earl Spencer told Channel 4 that broadcasting the tapes for the first time on British TV would cause distress, particularly to William and Harry. One of Diana's closest friends, Rosa Monckton, told the paper: ""How intrusive is this? It doesn't matter that it was 20-odd years ago. ""The tapes should have been sent to the boys. I just think it is absolutely disgusting."" Former Royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter told Sky News: ""I don't believe there's anything that we're going to learn from the tapes. I think it's absolutely shameful that these tapes have been made available."" The tapes have been broadcast before - by US network NBC in 2004. A Channel 4 spokesperson said: ""The excerpts from the tapes recorded with Peter Settelen have never been shown before on British television and are an important historical source. ""We carefully considered all the material used in the documentary and, though the recordings were made in private, the subjects covered are a matter of public record and provide a unique insight into the preparations Diana undertook to gain a public voice and tell her own personal story, which culminated in her later interview for Panorama. ""This unique portrait of Diana gives her a voice and places it front and centre at a time when the nation will be reflecting on her life and death."""

The speaker said: ""If you are black, you are already a suspect. ""If you are black and you are standing on a street corner and there are already more than two or three of you, you are seen as a gang.

""Killing our youths on the streets, the way they are doing... the only way the young'uns know how to retaliate now is with the riots, that's because they can't articulate themselves to bring the police to justice. ""Once these kids start getting together, using their sense and going against the police, that makes sense. As long as they are taking ours, we'll take theirs - that's the way they see it. ""It's not the family advocating that, that's just the way they see it."" The demonstration outside Stoke Newington Police Station on Saturday followed a night of violence. A group of angry demonstrators barricaded part of Kingsland Road in east London with wheelie bins, mattresses, and other debris at around 3.40pm. But as darkness fell, parts of the barricade were set on fire and riot police moved in. The violence only dispersed shortly after 11pm.

Most of us will have seen the video and there are questions to be answered."" Another friend of the family, Stafford Scott, told a small crowd outside the police station: ""This case is different. For once we've got the evidence. It's on camera. The world will feel it if we don't get the justice this young man deserves."""
2017-07-31,The founder and former trustees of Kids Company are facing company directorship bans of up to six years following a Government investigation into the charity’s collapse.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170731223517/http://news.sky.com/story/kids-company-bosses-face-bans-of-up-to-six-years-after-investigation-10968736,"Sky News can reveal that the Government's Insolvency Service has informed the former board members of Kids Company - who include Alan Yentob, the ex-BBC creative director, and Richard Handover, a former boss of WHSmith - that it will bring proceedings to seek their disqualification. In total, nine former directors are facing bans of between two-and-a-half years and six years, the Insolvency Service confirmed after an inquiry by Sky News. Camila Batmanghelidjh, Kids Company's founder, was not a director at the time of the charity's demise in 2015, but the Insolvency Service proceedings will allege that she was a de facto board member and should therefore be subject to the same effort to disqualify her. In a statement, a spokesman for the Insolvency Service said: ""We can confirm that the Insolvency Service has written to the former directors of Keeping Kids Company informing them that the Business Secretary intends to bring proceedings to have them disqualified from running or controlling companies for periods of between two-and-a-half and six years. ""As this matter will now be tested in the court it is not appropriate to comment further."" Sky News reported in April that the Insolvency Service was minded to seek the disqualification of the Kids Company trustees. Ms Batmanghelidjh ran the charity on a £90,000 annual salary and vehemently defended its governance even as it lurched towards bankruptcy. The charity's collapse in the summer of 2015 was a major embarrassment to David Cameron, the then Prime Minister, who had backed a £3m Government grant to the charity little more than a month earlier. He had said that the valuable work undertaken by Kids Company meant it was worth giving it ""one more go"" and was so moved by Ms Batmanghelidjh's work that she was awarded a CBE while Mr Cameron was PM. The charity claimed to support 36,000 children and young adults, working with those who were struggling with mental health issues after being involved in gun and gang crime, or who were suffering from neglect. In total, it received £42m of public money over a 15-year period - although some media reports have put that figure at as much as £50m. It eventually closed its doors, though, after the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into allegations of abuse at the charity. A damning report by MPs in February 2016 outlined an ""extraordinary catalogue of failures"", with its board of trustees reliant on ""wishful thinking and false optimism"". The Commons public administration committee said trustees had ignored repeated warnings from auditors about Kids Company's financial position. It also accused senior politicians of being in thrall to Ms Batmanghelidjh. The Insolvency Service, which is part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, is required to investigate company insolvencies, although its reports are never published. If the proceedings do result in the banning of Mr Yentob and his former colleagues from serving as company directors, it would represent a huge blow to the reputation of one of Britain's best known media figures. Mr Yentob chaired Kids Company for 12 years, but stepped down from his BBC role four months after the charity's collapse, saying his continued service was ""proving a serious distraction"" to the Corporation. He had been accused of editorial interference after criticising BBC journalists' coverage of Kids Company's financial problems. Companies House filings show that he is a director of a company called I Am Curious, a television production business he established last year. His fellow trustees included Mr Handover, a former chief executive, then chairman, of the high street retailer WHSmith. Two of his children were reported in 2015 to have been on Kids Company's payroll. Other directors included Andrew Webster, a former executive at the drugs company AstraZeneca, and Erica Bolton, an arts publicist. A separate review by the Charity Commission into Kids Company is reported to be ongoing."

As well as bomb-making materials, a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) pass card, a PSNI uniform and a police stab-proof vest were found in barrels and buckets buried in the ground. :: Ex-Royal Marine's bombs 'still in circulation' Two of the hides were discovered by accident in County Antrim forest parks - one by a dog walker, the other by a camper. Maxwell, who was serving with 40 Commando based at Norton Manor Camp in Taunton, Somerset, pleaded guilty to preparation of terrorist acts, possessing images of bank cards for fraud and possessing cannabis with intent to supply. During a sentencing hearing, defence barrister Paul Hynes QC told the Old Bailey that Maxwell had ""no long-lasting republican ideology"" and would not have used violence for a cause. He claimed it was Niall Lehd, said to be a member of the Continuity IRA (CIRA), who was the ""instigator"" of a joint venture with Maxwell. Maxwell, 31, denied joining the Royal Marines in 2010 with the intention of infiltrating them He claimed he faked his support for the dissidents' cause because he believed old connections wished ""serious ill"" on him and family in Northern Ireland and England. However, sentencing judge Mr Justice Sweeney told Maxwell: ""I'm sure that you were and will remain motivated by dissident republican sympathies and a hostility to the UK."" He said: ""There was sophisticated offending on a substantial scale which took place over a period of more than five years. ""There was clearly the potential for the deployment of many bombs of varying types and sizes against multiple targets, with the ultimate intent of those planting the devices being to kill. ""There was considerable planning, including attack planning, research, and the acquiring of large amounts of materials including police items for use in disguise."" Sue Hemming, head of the CPS' special crime and counter-terrorism division, said Maxwell's stockpile of weapons could have caused ""serious harm"". She said: ""During police interviews, Maxwell never fully explained the motives behind his actions, but the public is undoubtedly safer with these items out of circulation."""

Andronicos Sideras, one of the owners of Dinos & Sons, then mixed the horsemeat and beef together before it was sold to other firms in a plot that deceived consumers and food processors. Although the face value of the fraud was £177,869, police believe the true cost has probably run into millions of pounds. At Inner London Crown Court, Sideras was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud and jailed for four-and-a-half years. Nielsen, who had already pleaded guilty to the same charge, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars. Alex Beech, who was described as Nielsen's ""right-hand man"" because of his role in arranging for the shipments to be transferred, also pleaded guilty and was given an 18-month sentence suspended for 12 months. The plot was uncovered in September 2012 when health inspectors from Newry and Mourne District Council made an unannounced visit to a Freeza Meat store in Newry and found a third of the pallets contained horsemeat. At the time, the wholesale price of beef was €3 per kilogram, while horsemeat was €2. Judge Owen Davies QC said it was ""not confined to this country, not confined to the firms we have heard about, and it's a big issue for the public to be concerned about"". He added: ""In my judgment, other people were at it as well as you."" Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said that ""while there is no suggestion the meat was unfit for human consumption, it carried a potentially high public health risk"". He added: ""Had there been, not a criminal problem, but a health problem, it would be impossible to trace it because the records had been falsified."" Sideras had claimed he was not part of the conspiracy and had only stored the product for FlexiFoods.

Vincent died about five months later in July 2012. Ms Rose, of east London, was given a two-year suspended sentence in August last year when the judge said the breach of duty was so serious it was criminal. However, she had her conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal in London on Monday. Vincent's parents Joanne and Ian Barker said they were ""devastated"", adding that the conviction of manslaughter by gross negligence should have been upheld. ""We remain in no doubt that if Honey Rose had not breached her duty of care to our son, he would still be with us today. ""Not only has Vinnie been let down by an individual optometrist, today, he has also been failed by the legal system,"" they said. Overturning the conviction, Sir Brian Leveson said: ""We add that this decision does not, in any sense, condone the negligence that the jury must have found to have been established at a high level in relation to the way that Ms Rose examined Vincent and failed to identify the defect which ultimately led to his death. ""That serious breach of duty is a matter for her regulator; in the context of this case, however, it does not constitute the crime of gross negligence manslaughter."" It is thought the case was the first conviction of an optometrist for gross negligence manslaughter."
2017-07-31,The High Court has blocked a bid by an Iraqi general to bring a private prosecution against Tony Blair over the Iraq War.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170731223517/http://news.sky.com/story/high-court-rejects-iraq-generals-bid-for-blair-war-prosecution-10968585,"General Abdul Wahed Shannan Al Rabbat has accused Mr Blair of committing a ""crime of aggression"" by supporting the US-led Iraq invasion in 2003 when he was prime minister. The general, a former chief of staff of the Iraqi army, wanted to prosecute Mr Blair and two other key ministers at the time of the war, foreign secretary Jack Straw and attorney general Lord Goldsmith. A ruling by the House of Lords in 2006 said there was no such crime as the crime of aggression under the law of England and Wales. The general's lawyers had asked the High Court for permission to seek a judicial review to get the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. But Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the Lord Chief Justice, and Mr Justice Ouseley rejected the bid, saying the case had ""no prospect"" of succeeding. Mr Blair was the main ally of former US president George W Bush as the US led a coalition of countries invading Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Mr Bush and Mr Blair accused Saddam of possessing weapons of mass destruction - a claim that proved untrue. Mr Blair's legacy as prime minister has been tarnished by his decision to support the war. The lawyer representing Gen Al Rabbat had argued that the Chilcot report - an extensive inquiry into the invasion - offered the justification for prosecuting Mr Blair. Michael Mansfield QC said the the report found that Hussein did not pose an urgent threat to the interests of the UK, and the intelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction had been presented with ""unwarranted certainty"". He argued that the international crime of a war of aggression had been accepted by then UK attorney general Sir Hartley Shawcross QC in the 1940s, at the time of the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war crimes. In 2006, the House of Lords ruled in the case of R v Jones - also related to the Iraq War - that although there was a crime of aggression under customary international law, no such crime existed under English law. In its ruling on the general's bid, the High Court said: ""In our opinion there is no prospect of the Supreme Court holding that the decision in Jones was wrong or the reasoning no longer applicable."""

It warned the mismatch of skills and jobs could contribute to another ""lost decade"" of stalled productivity and falling wages. Almost a third of employers admit they do not fully utilise the skills of their workers, while a similar number do not have a training budget, it found. Its research also showed that the ""over-educated"" are not just graduates, but those who have invested in apprenticeships and NVQs, as well as specialist training. ""The UK economy is set to undergo significant change in the coming years,"" the report said. ""The impact of rapidly advancing technology, an ageing population and exiting the EU will leave our economy looking very different by 2030."" ""Having an effectively functioning adult skills system will be crucial if we are to manage the impact of these trends, to shape them and to turn them to our advantage. ""However, there is serious cause for concern that our adult skills system is not fit for purpose today, let alone fit to face the challenges ahead."" Its recommendations include replacing the current apprenticeship levy with one covering skills and productivity and introducing a personal learning credit worth up to £700 a year for low-paid, low-skill workers to help people invest in their future careers. It also suggests introducing a personal retraining allowance of £2,000 to support low-skilled workers who have been made redundant, and appointing a minister to tackle the issue. ""Simply investing in skills and training is no longer enough,"" the IPPR said. ""Government needs to incentivise employers to use employee skills in the workplace to turn around flat-lining productivity rates and weak growth."" Britain's Brexit deal following its departure from the bloc is expected to include restrictions on free movement rules, although the precise arrangements are yet to be decided. Ministers have publicly referred to attracting ""the brightest and the best"" of highly skilled workers in future. But privately, some have argued that tens of thousands of low-skilled jobs currently filled by migrants cannot easily be replaced with British labour, if they face shortages."

She then left the gardens and saw the woman again, now sitting on a wall outside her home. The woman repeatedly asked ""where's Tracey"" and kept asking for money. Ms Smith told the woman she did not know anyone named Tracey and went inside and closed the door. The woman then rang the doorbell asking if she could use the toilet, and when Ms Smith said no, the woman forcefully pushed open the door causing Ms Smith to fall backwards and hit her head. The woman then grabbed Ms Smith's dog lead and started to strangle her with it before running off in an unknown direction. Ms Smith called out for help and members of the public rushed to find her covered in blood. Lambeth CID detective constable Vicky Vincent, said: ""This was a vicious unprovoked attack on an elderly vulnerable woman's own doorstep. ""The attack has left her very distressed.""

Of those seven, six have also faced allegations linked to child abuse images. The latest, former primary school governor David Turner, 72, pleaded guilty to importing the child sex doll after his claim that the doll was not obscene was dismissed at Canterbury Crown Court. Turner had earlier admitted possessing or making more than 34,000 indecent images of children aged three to 16. Dan Scully, deputy director for intelligence operations at the Border Force, said the dolls were often going to people who were committing other offences in relation to the harm of children. ""They were also, critically, people who were otherwise unknown to UK law enforcement in having an interest in sexual activity with children."" The dolls, which can cost thousands of pounds and weigh around 55lbs (25kg), are often manufactured in Hong Kong and China and arrive in the UK via online shopping sites. They are extremely lifelike, according to Liz Stewart, operations manager at the National Crime Agency's (NCA's) Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command (CEOP). ""They are the weight of a seven-year-old child, they are not something that is the traditional blow-up doll…(They are) very, very different - very, very more accurate anatomically,"" she said. As well as having false eyelashes and crooked fingers and toes, their silicone skin can be warmed up via a USB device. Other accessories include wigs and a cleaning device. It is not illegal to own a child sex doll, forcing authorities to prosecute under a specific charge of importing an indecent or obscene article. Neil Brown, director of law firm decoded:Legal, said: ""This is different to the possession of indecent images, or images of extreme pornography, where mere possession alone is a criminal offence. Perhaps we will see a new law soon, covering possession of obscene dolls or objects?"" Ms Stewart endorsed that view, saying: ""I think it's got to be through the full range of this criminality, from manufacture to sale, to import, to possess. ""And we need to make sure it's future-proofed in case there is the introduction of sexbots, the sex robots."" Jon Brown, head of development for the NSPCC, said he wanted more to be done to tackle the issue . ""The NSPCC is calling on Government to take action to criminalise the manufacturing, distribution and possession of these grotesque dolls, in the same way it does indecent images of children,"" he said. ""There is a risk that those using these child sex dolls…could become desensitised and their behaviour becomes normalised to them, so that they can go on to harm children, as is often the case with those who view indecent images."""

He struck his head on the ground after being floored with a single punch, and died from head injuries two days later at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The prosecution said the defendant - who was 15 years old at the time of the attack and cannot be named for legal reasons - had moved behind Mr Jozwik, jumped up from the ground and used the ""whole force of his body"" to hit him with a ""superman punch"". The attack was initially treated as a possible hate crime, but that theory was later discounted. The defendant said he hit Mr Jozwik in order to defend a friend, going on to say that two Polish men - who appeared to be drunk - were saying ""fight me, fight me"" and he felt ""scared"". Both prosecution and defence agreed that laughter could be heard during the attack, put down to the fact that Mr Jozwik was ""weaving around"". The defendant agreed with prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC that the laughter was because Mr Jozwik ""looked such an idiot"". Ms Cottage said: ""If you didn't like it, you could have scarpered, couldn't you?"" The defendant replied: ""Yeah."" He will be sentenced on 8 September at Chelmsford Crown Court. In October it was revealed five other youths, who prosecutors said were at the scene, would face no further action due to lack of evidence."

The spokesman said proposals for a new immigration system after Brexit will be brought forward ""in due course"" and added: ""It would be wrong to speculate on what these might look like or to suggest that free movement will continue as it is now."" With Mrs May away on a three-week holiday, tensions have heightened among the Conservatives. Divisions burst into the open after Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd said they backed transitional arrangements after the UK leaves the bloc, suggesting EU migration could continue. Mr Hammond said last week that there should be no immediate change to immigration rules when Britain leaves the bloc, adding that there would be a registration system in place for people coming to work in the UK during the transitional period. But in an interview for The Sunday Times, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said that any such move would ""not keep faith"" with the referendum result. He said the Cabinet had not agreed a stance on immigration. And a spokesman for Boris Johnson was forced to dismiss a suggestion by Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable that the Foreign Secretary was considering quitting the Government over Brexit. The Prime Minister's spokesman said Mr Johnson was ""doing an excellent job"". He said details of a post-Brexit implementation period were a matter for negotiations, he added, but Britain is not seeking an ""off-the-shelf"" solution. According to the Financial Times, Mr Hammond told business leaders that he hoped for an ""off-the-shelf"" transition deal with Brussels to maintain current trading relations with Europe for at least two years after Brexit. Number 10's comments came as Cabinet ministers Jeremy Hunt and Sir Michael Fallon sought to play down reports of a Cabinet split. Mr Fallon, taking part in Passchendaele memorial events in Ypres, Belgium, said the issue of immigration policy during a transitional deal would be ""one of the details"" for the Brexit negotiations. He told Sky News: ""All of us, whichever way we vote back in the referendum, we are determined to make a success of us leaving the European Union,"" adding that ""you mustn't believe everything you read in the newspapers."" Mr Hunt, the Health Secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Cabinet was ""completely united""."

According to reports, the suspects are all Australian-Lebanese - and despite earlier reports, they are not thought to be two sets of fathers and sons. The Sydney Daily Telegraph said that police had found a flight number for a Jakarta to Sydney route inside a bin during a search for evidence. It added that it was not yet known whether the flight number was related to the alleged terror plot. The group of men reportedly tried to board an international flight previously and failed, causing them to change their target to a domestic flight, according to The Australian newspaper. The Sydney Daily Telegraph said the idea was to use wood scrapings and explosive material inside a piece of kitchen equipment such as a mincing machine. The Australian Broadcasting Network said British intelligence reportedly led authorities to arrest the men after it suggested they may have been directed by someone else. Justice minister Michael Keenan said he would not confirm those reports. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a mincer was being examined, while The Australian cited multiple sources as saying it was a ""non-traditional"" device that could have emitted a toxic sulphur-based gas, which it said would have killed or immobilised everyone on board. The plot was ""Islamist-inspired"", police said. Sky News Australia Reporter Caroline Marcus said: ""Authorities have been tight lipped about the specifics ... but they have confirmed the plot involved smuggling a device on board a commercial flight. ""There have been reports the device was a domestic meat mincer which would have been filled with explosives and detonated on board ... Sky News Australia also understands the men may have been planning to release a toxic gas which could immobilise or kill passengers."" Police have been given an extra seven days to detain the men, who have not been officially named, without charge. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: ""Nowhere is far away from anywhere else these days."" ""In an age of the internet and the age of social media and the age of instant messaging applications, Syria is not a long way away from Sydney,"" he added. Mr Turnbull said security had been increased at all major international and domestic airports around Australia. Travellers have been advised to arrive at Australian airports earlier than usual - two hours before departure - to allow for extra security screening. The national terror alert remains unchanged at ""probable""."

There is a growing momentum for standing areas in top-flight football, with Celtic FC introducing a scheme last season and English Football League teams Shrewsbury and Northampton expressing their desire to run trials. But it remains a divisive issue for Liverpool fans, with many Hillsborough victims' families opposed to a return. SOS chair Jay McKenna described the result of the poll as ""significant"", adding: ""We know people will see this as backing of rail seating. ""We say to anyone who is campaigning for this to understand sensitivities and respect the views of those who disagree,"" he said. ""No one wins here, this has been a mature and sensitive conversation and we have arrived at a position. ""Those who have been through incredible heartache and tragedy have every right to be heard and to ask important questions about safety."" Ninety-six men, women and children were killed in the Hillsborough stadium crush on 15 April 1989. In June, senior police officers were among six men charged over the disaster. The defendants will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court in August, with the exception of former South Yorkshire Police match commander David Duckenfield who will not appear at this stage for legal reasons."

A sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey heard how Maxwell had constructed 14 pipe bombs. Four had already been used in attacks in Northern Ireland. The serviceman, originally from Larne in County Antrim, was arrested by counter terrorism officers in August 2016, three months after the discovery of two arms dumps in woodland near Larne. He has since been dismissed from the armed services. The subsequent examination of the contents of the dumps, which included explosives and other components, gave investigators their most significant clues. They were able to trace DNA samples on some of the components back to Maxwell, whose DNA was already on the police database following a conviction for an earlier assault. He was put under surveillance by the security services and seen visiting more arms dumps in other woodland hides not far from 40 Commando's base near Taunton in Somerset, where he was stationed. Across more than 40 dumps, police discovered 14 pipe bombs, two Claymore anti-personnel mines, one explosively formed projectile for use against armoured vehicles, other partly constructed improvised explosive devices and large quantities of cannabis. Authorities say the commando was growing and selling cannabis to help fund the purchase of other bomb making components. Maxwell told police he had taken a member of the Continuity IRA to one of the woodland hides in County Antrim. The court was told that the man he took to the hide was Niall Lehd, convicted in 2014 of possession of an explosive substance with intent to endanger life. Maxwell was described as operating like a sleeper agent, never giving himself away, as he constructed his devices. Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin, from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: ""Ciaran Maxwell went undetected by authorities for five years. He acted alone, he wanted to go undetected and was very careful, gathering his materials over many years. ""He gathered them in small amounts to avoid suspicion. He buried his materials in different locations. He did everything he could to remain undetected."" Mr Martin said that a small number of bombs constructed by the marine were likely to still be in circulation, in the hands of dissident republican groups for use in future planned attacks. He added: ""Ciaran Maxwell does have links to violent republican dissident groups in Northern Ireland. ""He was undoubtedly making these bombs in the knowledge that they would be used by these republican groupings to carry out their terrorist campaign. ""Most likely they would have been used against police officers, prison officers, other criminal justice type targets in Northern Ireland, designed to damage property, injure people and potentially kill people."" The 31-year-old, a Catholic, grew up in Larne, a predominantly loyalist community. Some of those who know him from his hometown said they were unaware of any links to republican extremists. When he was 16, he was very badly beaten by a loyalist gang in Larne. At the time, he told his story to the republican newspaper An Phoblacht. The UK armed forces have carried out a review of the recruitment vetting procedures in the wake of Maxwell's arrest. Former British army commander Colonel Richard Kemp said political correctness and human rights legislation had combined to ensure vetting within the armed forces was ""not as rigorous as it once was."" He also expressed concern at apparent weaknesses within the auditing procedures for munitions stores at military bases. Colonel Kemp said: ""In reality the Armed Forces, the Marines, the Army, the RAF and the Navy are all very diligent about doing whatever they can to prevent weapons, ammunition and explosives being taken away by service personnel. But clearly there were gaps in the system which allowed this to happen. ""I'm sure the relevant military authorities will now have looked into this and done what they can to close that gap … But it is of course worrying that he was able to do this in the first place."" The Old Bailey was told that Maxwell had researched some 300 possible targets for attack, including PSNI stations and electricity substations. The former Royal Marine, who served for a time in Afghanistan, is now a convicted terrorist, his military career at end as he begins his lengthy jail term."

But councils worry the £255m being allocated by Westminster won't be enough to help them tackle the problems, especially given tightening budgets. Added to that, stripping away traffic calming measures to reduce cars braking and accelerating (which doubles exhaust emissions) could also compromise road safety: speed bumps on roads by schools, for example, are there for a reason. But while Greenpeace says ""real solutions, not gimmicks"" are required, the proposals are designed to both satisfy legal requirements (after a court deemed the Government's record on reducing air pollution to be so poor as to be illegal under EU rules) and phase in changes so the car industry is not alarmed. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has warned an outright ban on petrol and diesel cars could ""undermine the UK's automotive sector"", which employs 800,000 people and is already exhibiting nervousness over the possible impact of Brexit. But the Government's decision to consult on plans for a targeted scrappage scheme for polluting vehicles this autumn is designed to allay industry fears, while also allowing local authorities to come up with their own trade-in alternatives. So there is also some clever politics here. The Government has passed the onus of sorting out these pollution hotspots to local authorities, while pushing any ban on ""traditional"" diesel and petrol cars down the road until 2040. Environment Secretary Michael Gove can argue he's given car manufacturers plenty of notice, by which time technology could have made electric vehicles cheaper to produce anyway. He has also put pressure on councils to deal with the immediate concerns of poor air quality and kicked the controversial issue of scrappage into consultation while trailing next year's more comprehensive Clear Air Strategy. Environmentalists were never going to be happy with the speed and scope of Wednesday's plans, but there's enough to neuter any damaging criticism at the start of Parliament's summer break."

Just days before, the former New York financier had let rip with an expletive-laden rant in which he threatened to ""eliminate everyone"" in his communications team. The White House said the change had been made to give John F Kelly - the new chief of staff who was sworn into office on the same day as Mr Scaramucci's removal - a ""clean slate"". Reince Priebus Chief of staff Reince Priebus was sacked after being made the subject of a foul-mouthed tirade by Mr Scaramucci. He accused Mr Priebus of being ""a f****** paranoid schizophrenic"" and of leaking information to the press. Mr Priebus' 189-day tenure was the shortest in modern history for a White House chief of staff. Sean Spicer Press secretary Sean Spicer quit after the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, warning over ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". Mr Spicer, who had been standing in as communications director, had a stormy relationship with the press during his time in office, with his blustering, confrontational style being widely mocked. Mr Trump said of him earlier this year: ""He's doing a good job but he gets beat up."" Mark Corallo Mark Corallo, spokesman for the President's legal team, resigned amid reports of disagreements in dealing with the inquiry into claims of Russian meddling in last year's US election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. He was said to be frustrated over an alleged strategy by Mr Trump's lawyers to discredit or curb the investigation. It is also reported Mr Trump's lead attorney Marc Kasowitz, who has represented the tycoon's interests for more than a decade, will also see his role reduced in relation to the Russia inquiry. Walter Shaub US government ethics chief Walter Shaub resigned after clashing with Mr Trump. Tensions emerged before the Republican tycoon even took office, given his plan to hand control of his business empire to his two sons. On stepping down, Mr Shaub, who served three presidents, said it had ""become clear to me that we need improvements to the existing ethics program"". He later said he was concerned the US was ""close to a laughing stock"" when it came to holding other countries to high ethical standards. Mike Dubke White House communications director Mike Dubke stepped down in May after just three months in the job. It was reported the President had become frustrated with members of his team, pinning some of the blame for his administration's problems on the communications strategy. James Comey FBI director James Comey learned he had been fired by Trump on the news. Mr Trump said he had sacked Mr Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. But Mr Comey testified that he believed he was fired to ""change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted"". Michael Flynn National security adviser Michael Flynn resigned after just 23 days in the job, over contacts he had with Russia before Mr Trump took office. He was forced out after it emerged had discussed lifting US sanctions on Russia with the country's ambassador to Washington, and had then misled the Vice President about the conversation. Sally Yates Acting US attorney general Sally Yates was fired by the President after she defied him over his controversial travel ban. She had ordered Justice Department lawyers not to enforce Mr Trump's immigration ban targeting seven Muslim-majority nations. The then press secretary Sean Spicer said at the time that Ms Yates ""has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States"". Others who are in the firing line: :: Special prosecutor Robert Mueller has faced criticism from the President over his investigation into Russian interference in the US election and possible ties with the Trump campaign. The White House has questioned the neutrality of Mr Mueller and sought to discredit him over his friendship with the sacked former FBI chief James Comey. Such is the threat to Mr Mueller, Republican senator Lindsey Graham is taking steps to block any move by the administration to sack the investigator. :: The future of attorney general Jeff Sessions is looking decidedly unsure after the President described him as ""beleaguered"". Mr Trump has said he is ""very disappointed"" in Mr Sessions and was ""looking"" at firing him. He is angry about Mr Sessions removing himself from the Russia inquiry after failing to disclose a meeting with a Moscow official during his confirmation hearing. However, Mr Graham has warned ""there will be holy hell to pay"" if Mr Sessions is fired."

Charlie was born with the disease which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. He was described as ""perfectly healthy"" at birth but was admitted to hospital a few months after he was born when he began to lose weight. His mother, Connie Yates set up a crowdfunding page after finding an American doctor who was willing to give Charlie nucleoside bypass therapy, but had to get permission from the court after Great Ormond Street said the therapy was experimental and would not help. :: Sky Views: Charlie Gard was exploited His parents, Chris Gard and Ms Yates, fought a lengthy legal battle to have him treated with the experimental therapy in the US. They eventually ended their legal fight after taking their case to the High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, and European Court of Human Rights. Speaking about Charlie's funeral, family spokeswoman Alison Smith-Squire told the Sun: ""They haven't finalised any plans yet but they have decided Charlie will be buried with his beloved toy monkeys."" The monkeys can be seen in an image of Charlie lying in hospital used in the media throughout the case. The parents' final request from the High Court was to have their son die at home, but they said Great Ormond Street Hospital ""denied us our final wish"" after a judge ordered baby Charlie's transfer to a hospice, where he died shortly after his life support was withdrawn. Ms Yates is quoted in the Daily Mail as saying: ""We should be planning Charlie's first birthday but instead we're planning his funeral."" Charlie would have turned one on Friday."
2017-07-31,The Bank of England will be hit by its first strike action in more than 50 years following the failure of talks to resolve a dispute over pay.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170731223517/http://news.sky.com/story/bank-of-england-strike-goes-ahead-as-talks-fail-10968998,"The conciliation service, Acas, hosted negotiations between the Bank and Unite union with the aim of averting the action. A four-day strike was due to begin on Monday but the first day was suspended to allow the talks to take place. The union said the dispute centres on the imposition of a below-inflation 1% pay pot increase for maintenance, parlours and security personnel. It said those eligible for a salary increase were at the mercy of their line manager's discretion. Unite said a protest to be held outside its Threadneedle St headquarters in the City on Tuesday would see striking staff wear Mark Carney masks. The union's Peter Kavanagh said: ""The governor of the Bank of England must take responsibility for the fact that his dedicated workforce is having to make their concerns heard from a picket line. ""The result of the Bank's failure to negotiate with staff is that the Bank of England now faces its first strike action in over 50 years."" A Bank spokesperson responded: ""The Bank has been informed that industrial action called by Unite will commence at midnight tonight for three days. ""The Union balloted approximately 2% of the workforce. The Bank has plans in place so that all essential business will continue to operate as normal during this period. ""The Bank has been in talks with Unite up to and including today and remains ready to continue those talks at any time."" The final day of the action is slated to take place on so-called 'super Thursday' - when the Bank makes its latest interest rate decision and delivers its latest Inflation Report."
2017-07-31,"Images of ""infeasible"" body physiques circulated on social media may be behind a 70% rise in the number of men treated in hospital for eating disorders, an expert has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170731223517/http://news.sky.com/story/fears-social-media-could-be-contributing-to-spike-in-male-eating-disorders-10968777,"NHS Digital data shows that in England, hospital diagnoses in men over the age of 19 rose from 480 in 2010-11 to 818 in 2015-16. Andrew Radford, chief executive of charity Beating Eating Disorders, told Sky News the significant increase could have been caused by images propagated on social media and in popular culture. He said: ""If you look at the pressures on men, there is a reasonable chance that social media is having an effect on the rise of eating disorders. ""If you look at the role models I had growing up in the 1970s they looked quite different to the role models people see these days. ""That pursuit of an infeasible, idealised body image could well be part of it."" The annual statistics show that the rate of increase was higher among older men - with a 70% spike in the 41-60 age group compared to 63% for those aged between 19 and 25. Over the same time period, there was also a 70% increase in the number of women admitted to hospital with eating disorders. Royal College of Psychiatrists consultant Sandeep Ranote said that while the figures were worrying, they show more men are seeking help. ""It's really vital we are able to intervene earlier than we are currently,"" Dr Ranote told Sky News. ""Often what has been the problem is that for males it is shrouded in mystery and there is a stigma around the illness. ""It has become more accepted as an illness for females so that is something we need to be better at dealing with."""
2017-07-31,"The UK's economic model will remain ""recognisably European"" after Brexit, according to the Chancellor.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170731223517/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-will-not-be-tax-haven-after-brexit-hammond-says-10968530,"Philip Hammond told the French newspaper Le Monde that the UK will not become an aggressive Singapore-style corporate tax haven by slashing corporation tax and cutting regulations for business. In an interview published over the weekend, he told the paper: ""I often hear it said that the UK is considering participating in unfair competition in regulation and tax. That is neither our plan nor our vision for the future."" ""The amount of tax we raise as a percentage of our GDP puts us right in the middle of the pack. We don't want to change even after we've left the EU. ""I would expect us to remain a country with a social, economic and cultural model that is recognisably European."" The Chancellor is tempering his stance from earlier in the year. Indeed he can attribute some of the suggestions that the UK's might become a tax-haven to himself. In an interview for German Newspaper Welt am Sonntag in January, he said that with the UK would like to remain a European style economy but added: ""If we are forced to become something different then we will have to become something different."" He clarified: ""We could be forced to change our economic model, and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness."" At the time the comments were considered unhelpful by EU negotiators. This latest interview seems to be a softening of the Chancellor's language, in the same way that the Government seems to have stopped saying that ""no deal is better than a bad deal."" But all this comes amid tensions in the Cabinet while the Prime Minister is on holiday. Last week Mr Hammond signalled the UK's desire for an extended post-Brexit transition period under which free movement would continue for a further three years. However, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox insisted unregulated free movement of labour after Brexit would ""not keep faith"" with the EU referendum result and the Cabinet had not agreed a stance on immigration. Dr Fox said he had not been involved in any discussions on migrant transitional arrangements. Former Brexit minister David Jones said Dr Fox and Boris Johnson, both out of the country when Mr Hammond announced the transition plans, were ""clearly being kept out of the loop"". Mr Johnson was even forced to deny suggestions he was set to quit the Cabinet over the Brexit rift. It was Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable who referred to rumours of the Foreign Secretary's resignation. A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: ""Vince Cable is making this stuff up and maybe he should take more time to think up some policies rather than wasting his time on peddling lies."""
2017-07-31,"Riot police have been sent in to deal with unrest at a prison in Hertfordshire, amid claims that two wings are ""out of control"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170731223517/http://news.sky.com/story/riot-police-sent-in-to-out-of-control-hertfordshire-prison-10969126,"The Ministry of Justice has confirmed that specially trained staff are dealing with an ongoing incident at The Mount. According to Alex Cavendish, a prison affairs academic and blogger, staff shortages and a ""restricted regime"" may be to blame for the unrest. He explained: ""The technical term is that the staff have lost control of two wings. What 'lost control' means is that the prisoners are basically rioting, in layman's terms."" The two wings affected in the Category C prison are believed to house a total of 227 prisoners. A 2015 inspection had concluded that the prison was ""reasonably safe"" and felt ""calm and well ordered"", with some ""room for improvement"". But Mr Cavendish has claimed he warned the prison was ""on the brink of a meltdown"" only days ago. He said he has been told of prisoners locked up for 24 hours a day in some cases, with food delivered cold to cell doors. Earlier this month Tornado squads who are specially trained and equipped to deal with riots were sent to tackle unrest at HMP Hewell in Worcestershire. Official reports had described many challenges at that prison - including serious issues with ""safety and respect"", high levels of violence and an increase in self-harm among inmates. The unrest followed warnings from the UK's prison watchdog of ""appalling"" conditions in jails that have been exacerbated by staffing levels that were ""simply too low to keep order"". Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales, said many jails were unable to ""run a decent regime"" that allowed prisoners to be let out of their cells and access training opportunities or basic facilities. Assaults on staff increased by 38% last year with a total of 6,844 incidents, and 21 of 29 inspected prisons were judged not good enough on safety. A Freedom of Information request filed by Sky News found riot-trained Tornado officers were being called to deal with an increasing number of serious incidents in jails - 16 in 2016 compared to three in 2011. Mr Cavendish said the Tornado squads had been called in to The Mount prison on Monday. Situated near the village of Bovingdon in Hertfordshire, The Mount is a facility for prisoners who are nearing the end of their sentences and receiving training and resettlement assistance."

That's less than half the rate one might previously have considered normal. :: Sluggish growth continues for economy That weak growth, as the Chancellor told me, is partly down to Brexit - the nervousness faced by businesses and consumers, unsure of our future relationship with the EU and unwilling to invest as much as they would have done. And yet, despite wanting to tell businesses that they will have a transition period - something to ease the shift from being inside to being outside the EU - he simply can't. In his words, he ""can't give a cast iron guarantee"" - because Britain has yet to agree to a transition with its European counterparts. It is an invidious situation. On the bright side, the UK economy is not mired in the recession some economists feared after the referendum. But annual growth of less than 2%, which is what the IMF now expects for the UK, implies Britons feeling the pinch for many more months. Indeed, having been the industrialised world's fastest growing economy before the vote, it is now one of the weaker performers. And yet because government has been effectively paralysed by Brexit, and because the negotiations are only now creaking into action, there is little he can do to try to relieve that uncertainty. No wonder he told me that talks over the so-called ""implementation period"" should be the first thing on the agenda in Brussels. Still, it's a reminder of how much things have changed for UK economic policymaking in the past few months. Remember: Britain has plenty of challenges not related to Europe. Productivity is weak - real wages were squeezed well before one considers the post-vote period - and there are worries that the UK is punching below its weight on innovation and industrial policy. And yet because of the referendum - and then June's election - the Chancellor has little realistic prospect of imposing major reforms on the UK economy. He can't even guarantee the implementation period he and business want - despite having (eventually) persuaded his Brexiteer cabinet colleagues that it's necessary. A tough spot to be in. Then again, no one said this would be easy."
2017-07-31,President Trump has decided to remove Anthony Scaramucci from his job as communications director after just 10 days.     ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170731223517/http://news.sky.com/story/trumps-new-comms-director-scaramucci-is-sacked-nyt-10969217,"""Mr Scaramucci felt it was best to give chief of staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team. We wish him all the best,"" the White House said in a statement. Hours earlier, Mr Trump tweeted that there was ""no ""chaos"" at the White House. Mr Scaramucci, a wealthy New York financier, caused a commotion in Washington last week after describing then White House chief of staff Reince Priebus as a ""paranoid schizophrenic"" to a journalist from The New Yorker magazine. Referring to the Trump administration's chief strategist, he said: ""I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own c***."" :: Will Trump lose support over White House chaos? Maybe not New White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Monday that President Trump felt Mr Scaramucci's comments were ""inappropriate for a person in that position"". She added that Mr Trump did not want to ""burden General Kelly with that line of succession"". Regarding the new chief of staff, she said General Kelly had ""the full authority to operate within the White House and all staff will report to him"". :: You're fired! Sackings and resignations in Donald Trump's White House Mr Scaramucci's arrival in the West Wing on 21 July coincided with the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer. Mr Spicer had ""vehemently disagreed"" with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, telling the President it was ""a major mistake"", the New York Times reported. Mr Priebus was removed by President Trump late last week. It has not been an easy period for Mr Scaramucci. US media has reported that his wife filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant, and that he congratulated her by text when their second son was born last week."
