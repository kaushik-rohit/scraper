2017-01-16,A man has been arrested over the death of his 23-year-old brother in a New Year's Day fire attack.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/man-arrested-for-new-years-day-fire-attack-in-milngavie-10728030,"Cameron Logan died when his family home in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire. was set ablaze. His brother Blair, 26, is in custody. Cameron's girlfriend, Rebecca Williams, 24, was rescued from the house and was critically injured. She remains in a stable condition in hospital. His mother and father were also in the house at the time of the attack but managed to escape. They suffered from smoke inhalation. Police said they were treating the death of Cameron Logan as murder, and the attack on his girlfriend and parents, both 54, as attempted murder. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""A 26-year-old man has been arrested and is currently detained in police custody in connection with the death of a 23-year-old man and the alleged attempted murder of a 24-year-old woman, a 54-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man on January 1, 2017 in Achray Place, Milngavie."" He is due to appear at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Monday. The arrest came just days after detectives were able to begin talking to Ms Williams in hospital. The couple had attended a New Year party in the hours before the fatal fire. They had walked home to Mr Logan's house and were inside when the fire was started at 7.25am."
2017-01-16,"A senior Conservative has hit out at the Government for trying to ""scapegoat"" GPs for the pressures on emergency departments.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/tory-mp-attacks-pm-for-trying-to-scapegoat-gps-10729940,"Dr Sarah Wollaston, a former family doctor who chairs an influential committee of MPs, said the profession was under ""relentless pressure"" and did not have the capacity to extend opening hours as demanded by the Government. Outspoken Dr Wollaston hit out at the accusation - made by Downing Street - that GP surgeries were too often closing during the day. The comments are likely to stoke ongoing tensions between ministers and the medical profession over NHS funding. Theresa May this week warned GP surgeries to stay open longer, from 8am to 8pm seven days a week, to give patients appointments when they want them or risk losing funding. The Prime Minister was said to be frustrated by the number of practices which do not offer extended opening hours, claiming the failure to do so adds to pressure on struggling A&Es. But Dr Wollaston told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""As someone who has worked in the NHS for 24 years, it's entirely wrong to blame just one section of the workforce for this. ""GPs are extraordinarily stretched, working under relentless pressure, as bed numbers are being cut. We have the lowest number of beds per head in Europe. ""What we’re finding is more and more complex conditions coming to primary care... the workforce simply isn't there in many parts of the country. ""To then be suggesting that all of this problem is due to GPs not seeing people is really stretching it, it's just not the case, it's wrong to be scapegoating them in my view."" :: Sunday slots booked by Thursday: How seven-day services are working at one surgery Dr Wollaston has been a vocal critic of the Government on NHS funding. As chair of the Commons Health Committee she has disputed the Government's claim that they have allocated NHS £10bn over this Parliament. Today, she reiterated her criticism that the figure used by ministers was ""not strictly true"" due to cuts to social care and public health budgets - and she believes the true figure is closer to £4.5bn. It places her on the side of NHS boss Simon Stephens, who said the Government was ""stretching it"" to make that claim. He escalated tensions with Number 10 by pointing out the UK spent less on health than comparable Western nations. Dr Wollaston disagreed with the Red Cross, which said the NHS was becoming a ""humanitarian crisis"" this month for going too far in comparing the UK to war zones. But she said winter pressures on the NHS, which ministers say are routine, have given way to ""pressures all year round"". She defended GP surgeries which close during the day, saying: ""As a former GP I would just reflect that just because they are sometimes not holding surgeries at that time, they are very often doing other vital things. ""There's a huge amount of administration and home visits…and very often that needs to take place during working hours, chasing up results and so forth and going to meetings with colleagues."""
2017-01-16,"Theresa May is expected to announce the UK is prepared to leave the single market, the customs union and European Court of Justice. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-pm-expected-to-say-uk-prepared-to-leave-single-market-10729623,"The PM’s willingness to give up membership of the single market will be made clear in a major speech at Lancaster House in London on Tuesday, according to the Sun on Sunday. Her red lines will be an end to free movement from the EU and clearance to hold bilateral trade talks with other countries, which it is thought will not be achievable while still in the single market. A Downing Street source told Sky News: ""The issue of the single market and the customs union will be answered on Tuesday when the Prime Minister sets out her negotiations."" Pro-EU campaigner MP Anna Soubry has described the anticipated move as ""grossly irresponsible, if true"". The Conservative MP for Broxtowe said: ""The Government has no mandate for this. To go into the negotiation conceding on the single market and the customs union is extremely serious and very bad news."" The pound crashed last Monday after comments by Mrs May on the single market in an interview with Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Mrs May insisted she was not ""muddled"" in her thinking about leaving the EU but warned Britain cannot expect to hold onto ""bits"" of its membership. The PM is also expected to use her speech to appeal for the country to unite post-Brexit and end ""division and the language associated with it"". She will also condemn the use of the words ""Leaver"" and ""Remainer"" as she asks for Britain to ""unite to make a success of Brexit"". :: PM urged to set out Brexit plan by mid-FebruaryShe will say that while people may have had different views about the outcome of referendum, ""the victors have the responsibility to act magnanimously. The losers have the responsibility to respect the legitimacy of the result. And the country comes together"". She will add: ""The overwhelming majority of people – however they voted – say we need to get on and make Brexit happen. ""Business isn't calling to reverse the result, but planning to make a success of it. And the House of Commons has voted overwhelmingly for us to get on with it too. ""So the country is coming together. Now we need to put an end to the division and the language associated with it – Leaver and Remainer and all the accompanying insults – and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly Global Britain."" Shadow minister for Brexit Kier Starmer told Sky News: ""Theresa May has had six months to give some clarity, she hasn’t done it. She needs to do that on Tuesday and she needs to reassure the country. ""If, as is expected, she says that she will be leading the UK out of the single market the question is, 'What are you going to put in its place? What are you going to negotiate to make sure that business can succeed in the future in the way it succeeds now?'"" :: Labour 'not wedded to free movement' - Corbyn Mr Starmer added that he would be setting out what Labour hopes Mrs May will guarantee in her speech – including rights to remain for EU citizens already in the UK. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that the Netherlands will block any trade deal with the UK unless it signs up to tough tax avoidance regulations preventing it from becoming a tax haven. The Deputy Prime Minister, Lodewijk Asscher, has written to socialist leaders across the continent stipulating his party’s red lines in coming talks. In a letter seen by The Guardian, however, Mr Asscher writes that it is in the interests of both the UK and the remaining 27 EU member states that Mrs May's government is prevented from creating a low-tax outpost. He writes: ""Let’s fight the race to the bottom for profits taxation together which threatens to come into existence if it is up to the Conservative UK government. ""This is why I propose to come to a new trade agreement with Great Britain, but only if we can agree firmly upon tackling tax avoidance and stopping the fiscal race to the bottom."""
2017-01-16,Thirty inmates have been killed - some beheaded or burned alive - in fighting between rival gangs in a Brazilian prison.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/three-inmates-beheaded-in-brazilian-prison-riot-10729872,"The deaths happened after a riot broke out at the Alcacuz Penitentiary, just south of the city of Natal in eastern Brazil. Prisoners from a criminal faction in one cell block are said to have invaded another cell block occupied by their rivals. The violence at the largest jail in Rio Grande do Norte state is the latest in a series of massacres at the country's prisons. The death toll of 30 was reported to Reuters by a source ""with direct knowledge of the situation"". Zemilton Silva, the state's co-ordinator of the prison system, told G1 Globo news website: ""We could see the heads ripped off"" three inmates. Other inmates are thought to have been burned alive. Police have surrounded the jail and blocked off all access routes but said they were waiting until dawn before trying to bring the situation under control. Mr Silva said he did not know if other cell blocks have been affected. The jail houses nearly twice as many inmates as it was designed to with about 1,150 living there, compared to the 650 it was built to support. Just last week, dozens more inmates died in riots in northern and Amazonian Brazil. Some 56 inmates were killed during another fight at a prison in Manaus on New Year's Day. Authorities said a gang called Family of the North targeted members of Brazil's most powerful criminal gang, First Command, known by the Portuguese acronym PCC. Many of the dead were beheaded and dismembered. On 6 January, violent clashes at Monte Cristo prison in Boa Vista left 33 dead. It is believed many of the clashes involve gangs that are fighting for control of the supply of drugs. Experts also say that PCC is exploiting overcrowding in the Brazil's jails to expand its reach across the national prison system. The gang network controls the supply and trafficking of drugs both inside and outside prisons even though many of its leaders are in maximum security jails. An official report in 2014 said Brazil has the world's fourth largest prison population, after the United States, China and Russia."
2017-01-16,Flood-threatened residents along parts of the east coast have returned to their homes after a feared storm surge was not as bad as expected.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/residents-relief-as-threat-of-severe-floods-subsides-10728037,"The Environment Agency issued 32 flood warnings which means some flooding is expected and 45 flood alerts, meaning it is likely, but downgraded its severe flood warnings from 17 to zero on Saturday. Those in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex were told they were most at risk, but residents in Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and East Yorkshire were also warned to stay away from coastal areas. The Environment Agency said the situation had not been as bad as predicted as ""a combination of the peak surge, strongest winds and largest waves didn't coincide in all areas and did not reach the most dangerous levels that were possible all along the coast"". Evacuations took place in Jaywick, Mistley and Mersea in Essex, and residents in 1,800 properties in east Suffolk were also told to leave their homes. Ahead of the predicted surge in Jaywick many residents had refused to leave their homes, despite an emergency services evacuation plan involving hundreds of soldiers and pleas from police. But the coastal village was spared from a deluge of sea water as the high tide passed in the early hours of this morning and did not breach the wall as expected. Kevin Cripps, 52, said he ""did not expect it to flood"" but thought the emergency services' response was appropriate, adding: ""They have been absolutely marvellous. ""I told the police I was not leaving and they were fair about it."" A Suffolk Constabulary spokesman said there had been flooding in some coastal areas ""with some premises affected along the east coast"", but he added, ""the extent of the flooding was not as bad as may have been"". The risk of flooding in Great Yarmouth was expected to peak on Friday night, but the worst fears of the people in the area were not realised. Charles Osborne, 52, from Great Yarmouth, said: ""The river did get pretty high but I didn't think it would ever go over the walls. I guess it was a lot of panicking but you can't be too careful."" According to its live incidents web page, Norfolk Fire & Rescue Service attended a few incidents to ""assist with flooding"", including rescuing people stuck in flood water, and assisting ""with emergency lighting at an evacuation centre"" in Walcott. Police said a man was arrested for public order offences after jumping into the river in Great Yarmouth. Superintendent Dave Buckley said: ""Despite numerous warnings from police and our partner agencies to stay away from the water, a small number of people do not seem to be taking this message seriously."" The flooding threat comes as Britain is battered by wintry conditions, with severe Met Office weather warnings for ice in place. Temperatures plummeted to minus 2C (28.4F) in parts of the East and South East on Friday. Scotland and the North of England were covered with a blanket of snow. Conditions are expected to turn milder and become more settled over the weekend."
2017-01-16,Over 50 of the world's leading artists are taking part in a new project called Cure³ to raise money for research into Parkinson's.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/damien-hirst-among-artists-raising-money-for-parkinsons-research-10728033,"Grayson Perry, Damien Hirst and Peter Blake are some of the big names who have agreed to create an art work using their own individual perspex box for the Cure Parkinson's Trust. Tom Isaacs, the charity's co-founder who himself has Parkinson's, says the response has been ""bonkers"". ""It's one of those things that has just gathered momentum and we're really excited about the prospect of this exhibition,"" he said. ""Parkinson's is like being trapped in a box, it's not a terminal condition but it is a life sentence, one without parole, and what we are trying to do is to raise the money to pay the bail and get people out."" Parkinson's currently affects 127,000 people in the UK and 10 million people worldwide. The degenerative neurological condition is characterised by tremors, stiffness and slowness of movement. Blake's cube is lined with fake grass and contains a small figurine of Snow White with two, even smaller, miniature people staring up at her. The pioneer of British pop art says he's exploring the ""strangeness of gigantism"" and scale. ""I picked up straight away on the figures and then needed to find a figure that would look very large against them. And I've always liked that rather primitive Snow White,"" he said. Bouke de Vries' cube uses a broken figure of Guanyin, the Buddhist goddess of compassion. Fifteen years ago the Dutch ceramic artist, who has collaborated with Grayson Perry on other projects, found out his partner has Parkinson's. ""I've lived with the symptoms and the impact it's had on his life and my life. To see him having to struggle to get a spoon lifted to his mouth, it's very sad and so frustrating because he wants so much to be normal but the Parkinson's holds him back,"" he said. The cubes will be shown together at a selling exhibition at Bonham’s London from 13-15 March."

Downing Street sources denied reports the photoshoot was linked to next month's visit to the US to meet incoming president Donald Trump. It is understood the pictures were taken last year, before Mr Trump's victory. ""The long-planned shoot for US Vogue will come out in April,"" a No 10 spokesman said. The news comes just weeks after the magazine's editor Anna Wintour was made a dame in the New Year's Honours list. It is not the first time Mrs May's fashion sense had made headlines. Former education secretary Nicky Morgan publicly criticised her for her extravagance after she appeared in a previous magazine spread. In that feature, she was wearing a £995 pair of leather trousers. Mrs May is also known for her kitten heels and eye-catching choice of footwear, including Wellington boots at the 2007 Tory Conference."

The patients who managed to get one are pleased to take advantage of the service. ""It's difficult for me to get time off work,"" said lecturer Jacqui Lindsay. ""I wasn't aware that they were open on a Sunday, so when I needed to book my appointment and I was given the Sunday option, it was better for me. ""It's difficult if I don't get to work to get someone to cover the class, so I'd have to take time off work."" It was at this same surgery, in May 2015, that former prime minister David Cameron gave a speech on plans for seven-day health services. As well as opening for three hours on Saturday and Sunday, the surgery is open till 8pm on Thursday. :: Tory MP attacks PM for trying to 'scapegoat' GPs The National Audit Office says that between 2015 and 2016, just 2.5% of GP surgeries in England were open on a Sunday. The figure rises to 21.5% on Saturday. Prime Minister Theresa May wants a seven-day service rolled out across all practices unless they can prove demand is not there. The Enki Medical Practice is run by Modality, an organisation which oversees operations at around 20 GP surgeries in the Birmingham area. They centralise parts of the GP service, such as call centres and paperwork duties, allowing them to spend money on running a seven-day surgery. Dr Will Murdoch, who works the Sunday shift, said: ""I think if it was just me, working alone without colleagues to support me, it would be incredibly difficult to try to support a service like this."" Dr Murdoch was critical of those in government who blame GPs for adding pressure on other NHS services such as A&E. He said: ""I think it's really unhelpful to single out any one part of the system to blame for what's going on in an incredibly complex organisation like the NHS. ""GPs are working incredibly hard, so are the hospitals, social care, the voluntary sector; we're all trying to do our best for patients, and to say it's the fault of any one group is incredibly unhelpful for what is becoming a very demoralised workforce."""

His comments, made to a German newspaper, came ahead of a major speech by the Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday. In an interview with the German Welt am Sonntag, Mr Hammond said: ""If we have no access to the European market, if we are closed off, if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement on market access, then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short-term. ""In this case, we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness. And you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do. ""The British people are not going to lie down and say, too bad, we've been wounded. We will change our model, and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged."" Mrs May will announce the UK is prepared to leave the single market in a speech on Tuesday, it has been reported. Her so-called red lines in the upcoming Brexit negotiations are an end to free movement and lifting the bar to starting trade talks with other countries before breaking with Brussels. However, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has told Sky News he was ""yet to be convinced"" by Mrs May over Brexit. :: Brexit terms explained - What you need to know Speaking to the Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, the MEP said : ""I'm quite certain Theresa May will do what she always does - sound very reassuring, she will look to be very much in control, saying all the right things and people like me will say it sounds great but why is it taking so long? ""When it comes to immigration, in particular, which she is highlighting, this is coming from the person who was home secretary and failed completely. ""I'm yet to be convinced, I have to say."" Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the PM of pursuing ""an extremely risky strategy"", taking the UK in ""the direction of a bargain basement economy"". Criticising Mr Hammond's remarks, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""It seems to me a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future. That doesn't really seem to me a very sensible way forward."" Mr Corbyn added: ""She (the PM) appears to be heading us in the direction of a bargain basement economy on the shores of Europe where we have low levels of corporate taxation, we will lose access to half our export market. ""It seems to me an extremely risky strategy."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron told the BBC's Sunday Politics that ""a hard Brexit is not the democratic choice of the British people""."

2017-01-16,Property guardians in Bristol are taking legal action in a bid to be recognised as tenants and to gain greater rights for others like them up and down the country. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/property-guardians-launch-legal-challenge-to-be-recognised-as-tenants-10729695,"Nic Connor, who has lived at the former Broomfields Nursing Home site in Bristol for two years, pays £294 a month in rent. However, he insists the building is in disrepair, with flooding and no heating or hot water. He doesn't feel that the property company, Camelot Europe, is fulfilling its side of the bargain. Mr Connor told Sky News: ""I wake up every morning and I have to wash in cold water because they've turned the hot water off. ""We have been harassed, we have had the lights taken out of the hallway. It has been horrible, but the reason we are taking it to court is so that a judge can decide whether we are living like tenants or legalised squatters that pay rent. ""We want recognition as tenants."" There are around 4,000 property guardians living in disused buildings up and down the country. The idea is that people pay below market rent, which in turn protects properties from damage and squatters. Many guardians say it helps them to save money so that they can get onto the property ladder, others use it as a place to stay following a divorce or separation. However, the legal action being taken in Bristol could put the whole system under threat. Peter Lloyd from Camelot Europe, which runs the Broomfield Nursing Home site, said the scheme had been running successfully for many years. He told Sky News: ""If they win the legal challenge, it would put people at risk in the buildings, the guardians themselves and also our jobs. In fact, the whole business model is based around a license and it could be devastating for us."" There are around 40 companies like Camelot Europe that rent out rooms in empty properties that are often owned by local councils. The property firms get to keep all of the profits, but insist the scheme saves councils hundreds of thousands of pounds every year, that would otherwise be spent on security. Whilst some believe that commercial companies are taking advantage of property guardians, others are more than happy with the current setup. Tim Moore, who lives in a former nursing home in Buckinghamshire, said there was a real community spirit in his building and that guardians could decorate the rooms as they wished, to make them feel more homely. He told Sky News that everyone living in his property was of a similar age and like him was using the scheme to get on the housing ladder. A decision is likely to be made in the Bristol case in the coming months. The city council said the Broomfield site will soon be redeveloped for housing and insists if Camelot Europe has breached its conditions, action will be taken and its contract will be revoked."

""It is increasingly clear that no part of the system and no patient is immune from the pressure the NHS is experiencing."" An investigation by the Observer revealed that appointments for cancer operations began to be cancelled in December and that trend has accelerated this year. :: Nurse in tears over lack of bed for 99-year-old Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust has this month had to cancel bookings for some complex cancer operations, as well as more straightforward cases, the paper said.

The woman who raised her, Gloria Williams, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping her in from a Florida hospital in 1998. ""I never gave up hope. Always thought I'd find her, always thought I'd find her,"" said Miss Mobley’s biological father, Craig Aiken. ""For anybody that has lost hope, just keep hope alive. Just keep praying just keep fighting."" Miss Mobley met her biological parents on Saturday at a police department in Walterboro, South Carolina, the town where she was located by detectives and subsequently identified through DNA testing. Mr Aiken described his first meeting with his daughter as ""beautiful"" and ""wonderful"" and said it could not have gone any better. Miss Mobley was taken from a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, just eight hours after being born. A woman, dressed as a nurse in a flowered smock and green hospital trousers, abducted her from her mother's room, according to the 1998 incident report. Upon learning the shocking news, Miss Mobley was in good health but emotionally overwhelmed, officials said. They said her biological family cried tears of joy. Miss Mobley and Williams had an emotional meeting during a hearing on Friday when Williams blew a kiss to the young woman from behind a caged door. A sobbing Miss Mobley then walked up to her, crying ""momma"" and telling the 51-year-old: ""I love you mom."" Miss Mobley then went on Facebook to defend her, saying: ""My mother is no felon."" She also said: ""My mother raised me with everything I needed and most of all everything I wanted. The ignorant ones won't understand it.""

2017-01-16,"Many of the relatives of the 30 British tourists who were killed in the 2015 terrorist attack in Tunisia are planning to attend the inquests into their deaths, which get under way today.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/tunisia-beach-terror-attack-inquests-to-begin-in-london-10730177,"The coroner, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith will hear evidence at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, and the inquests will last at least six weeks. In total, 38 people were shot dead when a lone gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui, attacked the beach resort in Sousse on 26 June, 2015. He killed holidaymakers as they were sunbathing, and in the Imperial Marhaba hotel where they were staying. The family of each British citizen who was killed has been allocated a day when specific evidence will be heard about how they died. :: Who were the Tunisia attack victims? But they have all been briefed in advance about the circumstances by British police officers. John and Janet Stocker were the second and third victims. Forensic evidence of their injuries suggests that they were lying on sun loungers when the gunman opened fire and would have died instantly. Their son Mark takes some comfort from that knowledge. He said: ""The fact that they were asleep or lounging and were totally oblivious to what happened does give you that comfort that it was instant and they didn't know anything about it. ""And they were together, which was the most important thing for us."" This week the inquest will focus on events leading up to the attack, and in particular whether the Foreign Office and travel companies could have done more to warn or safeguard tourists. Three months earlier, 22 people, mostly European tourists, were killed in a similar attack at the Bardo Museum in the capital Tunis. The Foreign Office updated the travel advice on its website with details of the attack. But Mark Stocker says his parents would not have been aware of it when they booked what they thought was a bargain holiday. ""When they looked at Tunisia, the prices had dropped drastically. It came to light that between March and June the prices had dropped 40%. ""My dad was Iike 'look at the holiday I'm getting. A five star hotel with all the trimmings. It's cheaper than Spain.'"" Officials and staff from the travel company TUI will give evidence this week, as well as representatives from the Metropolitan Police and Foreign Office."
2017-01-16,Theresa May is set to reveal more details about her strategy for leaving the EU in a major speech on Tuesday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/single-market-customs-union-your-guide-to-brexit-jargon-10729833,"The Prime Minister is expected to announce the UK is prepared to leave the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice. Here's a glossary of some of the key terms you're likely to hear in the next few days. :: Single market An association of countries trading with each other without restrictions or tariffs. The European single market came into effect in 1993. It accounts for 25% of global GDP and is Britain’s biggest trading partner. Currently, 45% of the UK's exports are to the EU while 50% of imports are from the EU. Access to the single market is based on countries signing up to the core principle of the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. :: Customs union A group of states that have agreed to charge the same import duties as each other and usually to allow free trade between themselves. The customs union reduces administrative and financial trade barriers such as customs checks and charges and boosts economic cooperation. The advantages of leaving the customs union are that Britain would not have to pay contributions to Brussels - in 2015 it paid £13bn into the EU, according to the Treasury - and would not have to sign up to the free movement rule. The Government would also be able to negotiate free trade deals with non-EU countries. The disadvantages are that though the UK could still trade with EU countries, it would face tariffs and vice-versa which could push up the cost of goods and services. The UK will also have to negotiate new trading deals with the EU which all member countries would have to agree to. :: European Economic Area The area that provides the free movement of people, services and capital within the European single market. Membership is open to member states of either the EU or the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). EFTA states which are party to the European Economic Area Agreement participate in the EU's internal market without being members of the EU. However, they must adopt most EU legislation concerning the single market except on laws concerning agriculture and fisheries. :: European Court of Justice This is the judicial institution of the EU. It deals with disputes between parties and ensures that European law is interpreted and applied in the same way in every member state. It has been argued that leaving the EU would mean human rights encapsulated by the European Court of Human Rights would be adversely affected on matters such as employment rights. Brexiters say it interferes with British justice and that the UK is already bound by common law which makes provisions for fundamental rights. They also point out that the UK is signed up to European Convention of Human Rights, which existed long before the EU and is entirely independent of it. :: World Trade Organisation The global organisation that deals with rules of trade between nations. WTO agreements are negotiated and signed by most of the world's trading nations. Britain joined the WTO as a member of the EU and it is expected that it would have to negotiate new and updated terms of its membership. This could be a long process because the UK would need all the other WTO members to agree on these terms. The Treasury has also warned that this so-called hard Brexit option could cut the UK’s GDP by 9.5% and trigger a loss of tax revenues of £66bn a year under WTO rules."
2017-01-16,"Voters believe the NHS is better off under the Tories than Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, an opinion poll suggests.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-safer-under-tories-than-jeremy-corbyn-says-poll-10729412,"It comes despite intense pressure on the prime minister over the state of the health service. The ComRes poll, for the Sunday Mirror and the Independent, found 43% thought Theresa May would make a better job of managing the NHS this winter - while 31% backed Labour. If #Corbyn can't beat May on #NHS after week we've just had, #Labour might as well pack up and go home. https://t.co/IekjwDkhlU However, almost half of voters - 47% - agreed the Red Cross was right to say the health service was in a ""humanitarian crisis"". The poll will be seen as a further blow for Mr Corbyn after the resignation of Tristram Hunt. The health service has traditionally been seen as one of Labour's strongest issues. Mrs May today further angered health professionals by warning GPs must open longer or risk losing funding. Mrs May wants surgeries in England to open 8am to 8pm, seven days a week, unless they can prove the demand is not there from patients. Doctors rejected the suggestion, accusing ministers of ""scapegoating"" GPs rather than address under-funding of the NHS. The British Medical Association said the Government should ""take responsibility for a crisis of its own making"" and address the underlying problem of ""chronic under-resourcing of the NHS and social care"". The Royal College of GPs said Mrs May was ""misguided"" in pushing for seven-day opening ""regardless of patient demand or local resources"". It comes days after she came under fire in the first PMQs of the year, with Jeremy Corbyn saying she was ""in denial"" over problems facing the service. The PM used her turn in the Commons to hit back at the Red Cross claims, calling them ""irresponsible and overblown"". The row comes after official figures showed four out of 10 hospitals in England declared a major alert in the first week of the year. Sixty-five out of 152 trusts issued operational pressure alerts as bed shortages intensified. NHS hospitals issued 222 serious alerts in six days to say they were experiencing major pressures. The NHS England data, which covers the period up to last Sunday, said the number of alerts was more than six times the previous six days. :: ComRes interviewed 2,038 GB adults online between 11 and 13 January."
2017-01-16,A man convicted of murder in the Netherlands has been jailed for life in the UK for a hammer attack on two police officers that was likened to a horror film.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/jamshid-piruz-jailed-for-horror-film-hammer-attack-on-police-10727952,"Afghan-born Jamshid Piruz lashed out when he was cornered by police after carrying out a series of burglaries. Police bodycam footage showed Piruz being cornered by PCs Jessica Chick and Stuart Young in a tool shed before he lashed out with a claw hammer. The court heard police had Tasered him three times, but it was ineffective because he was wearing thick clothes. PC Chick was trapped screaming behind a pillar by Piruz, who swung the hammer at her. She said: ""I have never been so scared in my life. I have never been in a situation where I thought 'this is it, I am going to die or I am going to be brain dead'."" PC Young, who was hit in the neck, said it was ""akin to a horror film."" Piruz pleaded guilty at Hove Crown Court to burglary, as well as two counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent and affray. The 35-year-old had previously served six years of a 12-year term imposed in 2007 for slitting a woman's throat in Almere in the Netherlands. He came to Britain in December 2015 to see relatives, but missed his flight home. When he was told he would have to pay for another ticket, he spat at an easyJet employee. After a court ordered him to pay compensation, he burgled garages in Crawley in Sussex, where he stole tools including a hammer. Police were called when a member of the public saw Piruz attempting a further break-in, which led to him attacking PCs Chick and Young. Judge Jeremy Gold QC sentenced Piruz to a minimum of six years in jail, telling him: ""This was an incident of truly terrifying violence, the officers were in fear of their lives and you had no reason to attack them whatsoever."" Piruz, he said, suffered ""acute psychotic episodes"". ""You are potentially a very dangerous man and you are prone to outbursts of potentially fatal violence when you are stressed, with little or no ability to control those outbursts,"" the judge said. Simon Blackford, defending, said his client, who sobbed in the dock, was remorseful and added: ""He suffers from post traumatic stress disorder after he witnessed the murder of his parents by the Taliban when he was 11 years old and subsequent experiences living in Kabul during the war."""
2017-01-16,The family of a university student whose body was found in the Thames are urging the Independent Police Complaints Commission to quickly deliver their findings into their complaint made against the Met police.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/parents-of-krishna-chummun-say-police-mishandled-death-10729722,"The Chummuns say not knowing what happened to their son Krishna is making ""every day a battle"". His mother, Medha, told Sky News: ""I want a murder inquiry opened for my son. At least he will find peace after death. We need closure. Every day is hard to survive. Every day is a battle for us."" Krishna, 19, was in his second year of a business degree course. He went missing on 7 August 2015 after playing football with friends in Enfield. In November, three months after he disappeared, police eventually issued a missing persons appeal. But Krishna's body had been pulled from the Thames one month before. And his body remained unidentified in a morgue because even though police had taken a DNA sample from Krishna's toothbrush they failed to make a match against the missing persons DNA database. Krishna was only identified after a speculative one-off DNA match against the national database using three of his extracted teeth. The family were finally told about their son’s death 11 weeks after his body had been recovered. Pradeep Chummun, Krishna's father, said this was another example of the ""police incompetence"" that had blighted the search for his son. ""All this time the body was just sitting there. They were lazy. This shows typical lazy, laid back inefficient policing. The way the case has been handled there has been a lot of negligence which I’m sure is because of our ethnicity. From day one they have been negative showing they are not capable."" Krishna's girlfriend told his parents they had argued on the night he disappeared and he had sent her texts saying he intended to kill himself by jumping off London Bridge. The Chummuns say they passed this information onto the police but officers dismissed their claims and refused to check CCTV cameras in the area or conduct a search of the water. Mr Chummun says the reason they were ignored was because of racism. ""I want justice for my son,"" he said. ""The only way to get justice is to open a murder investigation by an independent police force rather than the Met. Simple. I lost my son. I don’t think that's a lot to ask."" Krishna’s mother told police her son had been threatened before. She said: ""Krishna was coming from uni and was running fast. He said to my mum, 'Nanny, please go inside now. Just get in.' Looking very scared. He pushed my mum inside and double locked the door and turned all the lights off. ""My mum said some thugs had been running after Krishna threatening him and trying to attack him."" At an inquest into Krishna's death a coroner returned an open verdict. Dr William Dolman ruled there was not sufficient evidence to prove that Krishna had intended to kill himself. He said: ""Let us be frank, there are many gaps, we don’t know exactly when he ended up in the water or how."" The court was also told a few weeks before he disappeared Krishna had taken an overdose of painkillers after fighting with his girlfriend and had to be rushed to hospital. Krishna’s parents say their son's relationship with the girl had problems from time to time but he was very much in love and the pair hoped to marry. Mr Chummun has asked the IPCC to investigate a number of complaints. The most serious is the failure to take a witness statement from a neighbour who says she saw Krishna being attacked and abducted on the night he disappeared. The neighbour, known only as Doris, said three men bundled Krishna into a van after beating him with a baseball bat. The Chummuns reported this to the police but do not know if she was ever interviewed. Doris died shortly afterwards but told relatives and a family friend what she had seen. The Met says it cannot comment while its conduct in the case is being investigated. The IPCC says it is continuing with its investigation and cannot give a time scale for its completion."

2017-01-16,"Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, is to land more than £15m from an education business he helped set up, even as he fights an increasingly intense political battle over the NHS’s latest winter crisis.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/hunt-to-get-16315m-payout-from-hotcourses-sale-amid-nhs-crisis-10730426,"Sky News has learnt that Hotcourses, a listings service set up by Mr Hunt and his business partner Mike Elms in 1996, is expected to announce this week that it has been sold for between £30m and £35m. A deal was said by a legal source to be close to being signed on Sunday evening. Filings at Companies House suggest that Mr Hunt owns approximately 48% of the shares in Hotcourses, meaning a takeover worth £35m would yield a payday for the cabinet minister worth £16.8m. The latest register of MPs' interests says only that he holds more than 15% of the business. The prospective buyer of Hotcourses, which recently set up an international advisory group to accelerate its overseas expansion, is understood to be an Australasian company with operations in the education sector. It is not the first time that Mr Hunt has closed in on a big windfall from Hotcourses' sale. In 2013, the company's shareholders – excluding Mr Hunt – held detailed talks with Inflexion Private Equity about a takeover, but abandoned the discussions after failing to agree terms. The Health Secretary, who was expected to lose his job in Theresa May’s cabinet reshuffle last summer but was instead retained in the post, has had no active role in the running of Hotcourses since becoming the MP for South West Surrey in 2005. His shares are held at arm's length, according to previous reports. Nevertheless, the intense political debate about the NHS will make the timing of the sale awkward for Mr Hunt. He is far from the only Cabinet minister facing questions about their private wealth, even after a purge of ministers with close ties to Mrs May's predecessor, David Cameron. Mrs May herself has been urged to disclose the contents of a blind trust held in her name, which was created when she became PM last summer. In recent days, the Prime Minister has denied suggestions by the British Red Cross that the NHS's problems amount to ""a humanitarian crisis"". This weekend, Mr Hunt was plunged into a deepening row over the alleged ""scapegoating"" of GPs after Mrs May signalled that doctors' surgeries should extend their opening hours. Hotcourses was set up to provide listings information about evening, training, university and other courses. Now employing more than 200 people, Mr Hunt established the business when he returned to the UK after two years in Japan teaching English and learning Japanese. It now claims to be the world's largest course database, and last year's accounts filed at Companies House show that it acquired the UK's leading university ranking website, The Complete University Guide, and made more than £2m in profit in the year to July 2015. The Health Secretary has received several million pounds in dividends since Hotcourses was founded, including almost £1m last year. An adviser to Mr Hunt refused to comment on the deal on Sunday evening."
2017-01-16,"A teenage girl who was tracked down after being taken as a baby from a hospital 18 years ago has told the alleged kidnapper who raised her: ""I love you mom.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/girl-stolen-at-birth-kaimiyah-mobley-says-i-love-you-mom-to-abductor-who-raised-her-10728116,"Kaimiyah Mobley grew up with the name Alexis Manigo, believing Gloria Williams was her biological mother. But detectives have confirmed she was the infant whose abduction at just eight hours old in 1998 sparked a huge search. Investigators say a DNA test shows the teenager was the newborn taken by a woman posing as a hospital nurse in Jacksonville, Florida. Williams was arrested at her home in Walterboro, South Carolina, on Friday and is charged with kidnapping. The pair had an emotional meeting during a hearing on Friday when Williams blew a kiss to the young woman. A sobbing Miss Mobley then walked up to her, crying ""momma"" and telling the 51-year-old through a caged door she loved her, Fox reports. Miss Mobley, 18, went on Facebook to defend her, saying: ""My mother is no felon."" She also said: ""My mother raised me with everything I needed and most of all everything I wanted. The ignorant ones won't understand it."" Referring to both Williams and her biological mother, she added: ""I am going to give my mom a real chance but the bashing of my mother will not be taken lightly."" The teenager's birth family cried ""tears of joy"" after detectives confirmed the discovery, and they have now spoken to each other over the internet. Her paternal grandmother, Velma Aiken of Jacksonville, said: ""She looks just like her daddy. ""She act like she been talking to us all the time. She told us she'd be here soon to see us."" Williams' aunt, Susan Alls, said she watched Miss Mobley grow up and graduate from Colleton County high school. She refuses to believe Miss Mobley does not belong to Williams. Ms Alls said: ""I don't think it's true. There has to be something going on with the DNA, whatever they did."" After the baby was snatched, a massive search was launched but the case remained a mystery despite thousands of tips over the years. A few months ago, Miss Mobley ""had an inclination"" that she may have been kidnapped, said Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams, but authorities did not reveal what raised her suspicions.

 The breakthrough came after a tip received by the national centre for missing children led cold case detectives to Miss Mobley's home. ""She wasn't an abused child or a child who got in trouble,"" said Williams' neighbour Joseph Jenkins. ""But she grew up with a lie for 18 years."" Her mother, Shanara Mobley, told the Florida Times-Union newspaper on the 10th anniversary of the kidnapping that on every one of her daughter's birthdays, she wrapped a piece of cake in foil. ""It's stressful to wake up every day, knowing that your child is out there and you have no way to reach her or talk to her,"" she told the newspaper in 2008. Williams was denied bail and is set to be extradited to Florida."
2017-01-16,"In a recent chat with a former shadow minister, they mentioned to me that they had been offered a big job outside politics. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/why-tristram-hunt-wont-be-the-last-to-leave-corbyns-labour-party-10727234,"Tempting though it was, the MP turned it down as they have a safe seat and hope the Labour Party can, in time, recover. But they thought other colleagues in less secure constituencies would have gone for such an opportunity. Now Tristram Hunt, another former shadow minister, has become the second MP within a month to resign a seat in Jeremy Corbyn's party and seek a life outside Parliament. In some ways he was the most obvious candidate to do so - ambitious and with a successful career before politics, yet vulnerable in his constituency and clearly despondent about the prospects of his party. But still Labour colleagues are shocked by his departure. ""It's depressing that people like Tristram no longer see their future in our party, we can't afford to lose talent like that. He's one of our biggest brains,"" a colleague said. ""It's infuriating in a way because we (the moderates) want to be fighters not quitters, but who can blame him for taking a job like that?"" The historian and former education spokesman was seen as one of the stars of the 2010 intake and at one time tipped as a successor to Ed Miliband. He held on to his seat with a majority of 5,179 in 2015 but with UKIP on the march and the Conservatives a close third, both will fancy their chances in a difficult by-election for Labour. It is a seat which voted by 69.4% to leave the EU against the entreaties of their MPs. Hunt, the privately educated academic from London and one of the party's leading Blairites, was never a natural fit for his constituency, but he threw himself into the revival of the Potteries and into researching how Labour should tackle its dilemma on immigration. Like Jamie Reed, whose departure triggers a by-election in the marginal seat of Copeland, his seat was due to be abolished in proposed boundary changes and he faced a fight with his colleague Ruth Smeeth - another energetic moderate MP - to stay in Parliament. MPs say that will have factored into his thinking, as will the fact that Mr Hunt was targeted and threatened with deselection by activists from the Corbyn-supporting group Momentum, having publicly called on the Labour leader to stand down to prevent a wipeout at the next election. I'm told the boundary changes would take out a safe area of his seat, strengthening their hand. MPs close to Mr Hunt say it was a ""perfect storm"", but that he won't be the last to leave the fold. Some Labour MPs who lost seats in 2005 and 2010 have struggled to find jobs, and as one MP put it: ""If you get a great offer now, you can't blame someone for taking it - they fear they'll just be joining a long queue for jobs in 2020."" The MP added: ""This is a sign of the malaise under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - people think they'll be out or languishing on the back benches for a very long time to come. ""Other colleagues will be chatting to contacts and dusting off their CVs."""

He pleaded guilty to two counts of assault and one of causing criminal damage following the attack on Toys Hill, near Westerham, Kent. Stephens sprang to global fame after starring as Damien Thorn - a young anti-Christ - in the Oscar-winning 1976 film alongside Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. But his film career was short-lived and after school he went on to work in the City. The father of two was ""red-faced and angry"" when he confronted the cyclists on 21 August last year, Maidstone Crown Court heard. Kieran Brand, prosecuting, said Stephens repeatedly used his horn when riders Mark Richardson and Alex Manley were side-by-side on the road as one overtook the other. Mr Richardson's response was to flick his middle finger at Stephens, who then accelerated, overtook the pair and pulled over. Mr Brand said Stephens, who lives in Kent, punched Mr Richardson, knocking him unconscious before Mr Manley intervened. Stephens responded by asking Mr Manley: ""You want some do you?"" He then punched him twice in the face, causing him to fall on his back with his bicycle still between his legs. The court heard Stephens held Mr Manley down and punched him six or seven times, inflicting dental injuries and damaging his helmet. Mr Brand added: ""He described the defendant as being in a complete rage and being out of all proportion to what had happened beforehand."" Mr Richardson was taken to hospital with swelling to his lip and a broken tooth root, the court was told. Defending, Ben Irwin said Stephens, who had no previous convictions, pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and accepted he ""behaved poorly"". Judge Martin Joy sentenced Stephens to 12 months in prison on Friday, suspended for two years, for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and two months in prison, suspended for two years, for the criminal damage charge. Stephens will also have to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay compensation of £1,000 to each victim and an extra £120 to Mr Manley for his damaged helmet."

Demonstrators voiced anger over Mr Trump's comments on groups including Muslims and Mexicans, as well as plans to scrap Obamacare health reforms. The protest also included relatives of several African-American people killed in police shootings, Hispanic group La Raza, Planned Parenthood and LGBT group the Human Rights Campaign. People carried signs reading ""Resist Trump's Hate"" and ""Tu, Yo, Todos Somos America,"" which translates from Spanish to ""You, me, we all are America"". ""We march in the driving rain because we want the nation to understand that what has been fought for and gained, that you're going to need more than one election to turn it around,"" said Rev Sharpton. He told Democrats in Congress to ""get some backbone"" and fight against Mr Trump. ""We will march until hell freezes over, and when it does, we will march on the ice,"" said Cornell William Brooks, head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The incoming president has maintained his pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border, deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records, and restrict Muslims entering the country. Rehab Alkadi, a 31-year-old mother who came to the US from Syria, said she did not think she could be deported, but added: ""Who knows? It's so scary, what Trump says ... He said a lot of things bad about the Muslim people."" Mr Trump also plans to dismantle the Obamacare legislation, which has extended healthcare cover to many poorer people. The protests in the US capital came as Mr Trump criticised a prominent civil rights campaigner and politician on Twitter after he said he was boycotting the billionaire's inauguration. The President-elect said John Lewis was ""all talk"" and should instead focus on fixing his ""crime infested"" district. Congressman Lewis, who represents an area that includes most of Atlanta, is the most high-profile Democrat to snub next Friday's event. He said he would be avoiding the swearing-in ceremony because the tycoon is not a ""legitimate president"". Known for his decades of civil rights work - including alongside Martin Luther King - Mr Lewis said Russia's alleged hacking had helped Mr Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. In response, Mr Trump tweeted: ""Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. ""All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!"" Mr Trump's comments have sparked outrage among politicians on both sides in Congress. Cowardly @realDonaldTrump isn't fit to polish hero @repjohnlewis's boots. The Democratic Party of Georgia called on Mr Trump to apologise to Mr Lewis - and the people of his district. ""It is disheartening that Trump would rather sing the praises of Vladimir Putin than Georgia's own living social justice legend and civil rights icon,"" state party spokesman Michael Smith said. Congressman John Yarmuth, a member of the Democratic Party and a former member of the Republican Party, tweeted: ""All talk no action, @realDonaldTrump? @repjohnlewis shed blood to secure & protect basic human rights for all.

2017-01-16,"One of the world's best-known and oldest circus companies has been forced to close, partly because of declining ticket sales.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/greatest-show-on-earth-circus-to-close-10730024,"The Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus has performed for millions of fans during its 146-year reign. It was formed when the Ringling Brothers - the hosts of a popular vaudeville show - bought out Barnum & Bailey, who created PT Barnum's ""Greatest Show On Earth"". The bosses of the iconic American spectacle, which ends in May, said falling audiences were partly to blame along with high operating costs and ongoing battles with animal rights groups. Kenneth Feld, chairman and chief executive of Feld Entertainment, which owns the circus, said: ""This has been a very difficult decision for me and for the entire family."" Over the years, generations of Americans had been thrilled by the arrival of circus' exotic animals and death-defying acrobatics. PT Barnum got a taste for showbusiness with his first variety troupe called Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater in the 1830s and later went on the road with various 'freak' acts. But it was when he created PT Barnum's Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan & Hippodrome in 1870 that he first entered the circus business. Fifteen years later, the Ringling Brothers - Alf, Al, Charles, John and Otto - took their act on tour and the family later bought out their rival. Long before every home in America had a TV set, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey circus toured the country by train.

PETA has been protesting against the use of animals by the circus for many years



 In the 1910s, the Ringling Bros big top was said to use 335 horses, 26 elephants, 16 camels and other assorted animals that travelled on 92 railway carriages. But it became increasingly difficult in the late 20th century to compete with the huge range of other entertainment on offer. The circus has also been targeted by animal rights activists, including the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals group, which said it was pleased by the closure. Ingrid Newkirk, PETA's president, said it ""heralds the end of what has been the saddest show on earth for wild animals, and asks all other animal circuses to follow suit."" But Thomas Chipperfield, who has been described as Britain's last lion tamer and was the subject of a Sky News special report in 2015, said: ""It's purely devastating to see a giant like this fall. They were the greatest show on Earth. ""It doesn't change anything for us though. I'm here performing with tigers in Italy and business was good for us in the summer when we were on the road in Wales. ""It's a myth put out by the animal rights movement that tickets sales are the decline for us, what affected ticket sales for Ringling Bros, and they’ve said this themselves was the departure of the elephants from their routine."" The circus said its remaining animals - including lions, tigers, camels, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas - will go to suitable homes."
2017-01-16,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has attacked what he calls a ""rigged system"" in Britain where ""power is in the wrong hands"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170116010059/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-leader-jeremy-corbyn-hits-out-at-rigged-system-10728162,"In a speech to the Fabian Society, he hit out at the Government, saying: ""The Prime Minister may say she wants a shared society but the Tories have spectacularly failed even to begin to share the wealth fairly across society or the nations or regions."" He claimed power, wealth and opportunity ""lies in hands of the privileged few"" and was concentrated in and around London. He said: ""The people who run Britain have been taking our country for a ride. They've stitched up our political system to protect the powerful."" He also accused the Conservatives of slashing taxes for the richest - with cuts of £70bn over the next five years - while cutting pay and public services. It comes as Labour faces another battle for voters after former shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt announced he was standing down as an MP to become director of London's Victoria and Albert Museum. His departure triggers a by-election in Stoke-on-Trent Central. The party is already facing a by-election in Copeland and Leigh after the resignation of Jamie Reed and Sky sources say at least two other senior Labour MPs are considering quitting. Labour backbencher Hilary Benn defended the state of the party, telling Sky News: ""The challenge for us as a political party is to ensure that we can win the people’s trust and confidence at a time that is very turbulent in the world."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron responded to the speech by claiming Mr Corbyn was ""haemorrhaging decent, hard-working MPs"". He added: ""This is a Labour leader failing to hold the Government to account and allowing Theresa May to push forward with reckless, divisive, and uncaring policies."" In his speech, Mr Corbyn said: ""The Leave (EU) and Trump campaigns succeeded because they both recognised the system was broken and the people weren't being listened to. ""We're going to call time on this rigged system because power is in the wrong hands."" He promised to take failing care homes into public ownership if Labour gets into government, warning that the social care system is at ""serious risk of breakdown"". He argued that rising costs and falling fee payments from councils have seen 380 care home businesses declared insolvent since 2010. Mr Corbyn also pointed to figures from the Care Quality Commission which found last year that one in five nursing homes did not have sufficient staff on duty to ensure residents received good care. Labour MP John Mann said Mr Corbyn should be ""far more radical"", telling Sky News: ""I think the entire social care budget should be run by the NHS."" The opposition leader accused the Government of standing by while ""wages are driven down, industry declines and public services are sent into meltdown"". He claimed the Conservatives have been cutting council budgets by at least 40% and have ""devolved austerity"" instead of creating a ""northern powerhouse"". Mr Corbyn said in a post-Brexit Britain it was ""vital that the Government gives local authorities more powers and resources to innovate and generate prosperity and, crucially, to reduce inequality at the same time""."

A grocery shop owner who was forced by police to leave the area told Reuters the scene was ""like a horror movie"". A thick plume of smoke rose over the rubble as many onlookers cried.  و #پلاسكو فرو ريخت ... #لحظه_ي_فروريختن_پلاسكو #خبر #آتشسوزي A video posted by خانومِ شين (@roshanakshz) on Jan 19, 2017 at 12:09am PST Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the city's mayor, said rescuers were digging through the rubble to get to those trapped inside. He said there were no ""ordinary civilians"" trapped in the rubble, but witnesses said some people had slipped through the police cordon and gone back into the building. The steel skeleton of the building, which contained a shopping centre and clothing workshops, could be seen bending towards the ground as about 100 fire engines and dozens of ambulances surrounded the scene. Local Iranian state television said 30 civilians were hurt, while the state-run IRNA news agency said 45 firefighters had been injured. The semi-official Tasnim news agency reported an electrical short circuit caused the fire, citing an official in the Tehran governor's office. The blaze is thought to have started on the ninth floor and quickly spread to the workshops above. The fire appeared to be at its most intense in the building's upper floors, home to garment workshops where tailors cook for themselves and use kerosene heaters for warmth in winter. Fire department spokesman Jalal Maleki said authorities had visited the building ""many times"" to warn them about the conditions there. ""They stacked up material on staircases, which was very awful, although we warned them many times,"" he said. President Hassan Rouhani has ordered an ""immediate investigation"" into the collapse, IRNA reported. Sniffer dogs searched for signs of survivors buried under giant slabs of concrete and twisted pieces of metal. The search and rescue operation could last for more than two days, state TV said. Firefighters were initially able to bring the fire under control, but it quickly flared up and the building collapsed four hours after the fire began, at about 8am UK time. The 17-storey tower was constructed in the early 1960s by Iranian-Jewish businessman Habib Elghanian and named after his plastics company. It was the tallest building in Tehran when it was completed in 1962."

United became the first club to achieve a turnover of more than £500m in 2015/16, while Real, who had topped the list for the last 11 years, slipped to third - just £100,000 behind their Catalan rivals. The Old Trafford club got a boost from record-breaking kit and sponsorship deals with Adidas and Chevrolet and a return to the Champions League during the otherwise underwhelming reign of Dutch manager Louis van Gaal. The Deloitte study is in its 20th year and this year's top three is the same as in the first edition in 1997. The report's author Tim Bridge said: ""You can't really look past Manchester United returning to the top spot and it isbecause of their ability to make commercial deals that are way ahead of their peers."" Eight English clubs made the top 20 - including new entries West Ham and surprise Premier League champions Leicester City. More English sides are expected to break into the higher echelons from next year - when the Premier League's £5bn domestic TV deal is taken into account. But Mr Bridge warned the uncertainties of the Brexit era could hamper their earning power. Figures in this year's report were based on an average exchange rate of £1 = €1.34 but the current inter-bank rate is £1 = €1.15. UEFA last week warned that elite clubs were pulling further away from smaller rivals financially. The governing body's president Aleksander Ceferin said the game would need to address an ""increasing concentration of sponsorship and commercial revenue among a handful of clubs"". The top 20: 1. Manchester United £515.3m2. Barcelona £463.8m3. Real Madrid £463.8m4. Bayern Munich £442.7m5. Manchester City £392.6m6. Paris St-Germain £389.6m7. Arsenal £350.4m8. Chelsea £334.6m9.

Ten of his victims were shot on the beach at the Port el Kantaoui resort before he headed into the upmarket Riu Imperial Marhaba hotel in search of more victims. Inquests for the British victims are being held at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London. Venancio Lopez, managing director of Tunisie Voyages, a subsidiary of travel company TUI, flew to the capital to give evidence on Wednesday. He said he was at a meeting with British Embassy officials on 25 May, 2015, in Tunis - two months after the terror attack at the Bardo National Museum in which 22 people, mostly European tourists, were killed. Security in the resorts, and how visible it should be, was discussed and Mr Lopez said: ""If security is too evident they feel uncomfortable in the street."" In his statement to the inquest, he said: ""We wanted to increase the security in general but we didn't want tourists to be scared by seeing an army of police."" The inquest heard that it was decided that hotels should have metal detectors, staff should monitor CCTV, that police should patrol the beaches and there would be an extra 400 officers. The hearing is expected to last seven weeks."

Passing sentence at Hull Crown Court, judge Jeremy Richardson told the pair they did it to ""subdue and sedate her to allow you to indulge in your own squalid passion"". He said Pyke was ""utterly unfit to be a mother"" and saw her daughter as an ""inconvenience"" in her relationship with Rytting. Judge Richardson told them: ""You both bear huge responsibility for blighting the life of a pretty vivacious little girl."" The judge said Poppy was born a heroin addict and suggested Pyke even named her in reference to the drug. He said: ""It reveals your deplorable attitude, together with that of your then partner, towards that innocent infant."" The judge said: ""It is of pellucid clarity to me that during the period covered by the indictment, and before that time, you both existed in the swamp of drug addiction and drug peddling."" He said: ""The life of Poppy may only be characterised as tragic from the moment she was conceived to the moment she died."" Pyke ""emotionally abused"" her young daughter and her conduct was ""cruel and deliberate"", Mr Richardson added. Poppy was found dead at Rytting's home in June 2013, where prescription and controlled drugs were ""left lying around"". A post-mortem could not establish a cause of death, but toxicology tests conducted on her blood and hair found various drugs, and showed Poppy had been exposed to and had ingested significant amounts of heroin and methadone for a period of between two and six months before she died. Pyke and Rytting were sentenced for child cruelty by allowing Poppy to be accommodated in a house where prescribed and controlled drugs were unsecured and within reach of the child and by encouraging her to ingest prescription and/or controlled drugs. Pyke, 38, formerly of Ladysmith Road, Grimsby, was also convicted of child cruelty by emotional abuse, possession of methadone with intent to supply and supplying the same drug. Rytting, 40, formerly of Elsenham Road, Grimsby, was also sentenced for importing drugs, two counts of supplying controlled drugs and one count of possessing cannabis with intent to supply. Speaking outside court, Poppy's uncle, James Widdison, said he did not think the family or social services could have foreseen what happened. Standing beside Poppy's grandparents, Judi Widdison and Fred Soar, he said: ""We've waited three and a half years for this day and it doesn't get any easier. ""The memories we've got of her are everlasting. We won't ever be distanced from that. There's no such thing as closure with regards to this case."" Mr Soar added: ""She was a lovely girl - joyful to have round."""

The Scottish victims were named as husband and wife Mohammad and Talat Aslam. Following the deadly crash, Mrs Aslam's nephew Ali Gibran said on Facebook: ""This has put a dagger through my heart and I am still shell-shocked from the second I came to know of this horrendous news."" He added: ""My aunt was the heart of our family. So enthusiastic and a source for radiation of joy and happiness. A true gem embedded into our family. ""Her words sparkled in every gathering in which she took part. To lose her is one of the most agonising feelings in my life."" The group had just completed Umrah, a pilgrimage to Mecca, and were travelling to Medina, Glasgow Central Mosque said. A spokesman from Haji Tours, which had arranged the trip, said 12 people who had been in the vehicle were all related. A mosque statement said the Aslams were ""popular members of the community"" and were survived by their five children. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We are supporting the families of six British people who have sadly died following a road accident in Saudi Arabia. ""We are also helping several more British nationals who were injured in the crash. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families at this very difficult time."" Fatal road accidents on the road from Medina to Mecca - and the other way round - are very common. A British family of five died in a crash in February 2013 and in March last year 19 Egyptians were killed."

Guards will walk out for 24 hours on Monday and a small number of RMT members who drive Southern trains will strike on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday next week. The strikes are part of the union's long-running dispute over the introduction of driver-only trains. Southern, which announced this week it would restore a ""full train service"" from next Tuesday, said only 12 drivers were involved and its aim to return to normal on 24 January would be unaffected. And it said it would be able to run 70% of its trains on Monday - 10% more of its normal timetable than it has been able to operate on previous guard strike days. The promise to return to normal service on Tuesday followed drivers' union ASLEF agreeing to suspend three planned strikes and lift a drivers' overtime ban. It is due to hold talks with the train operator under the co-chairmanship of the TUC. Hundreds of thousands of passengers have been hit by months of disruption because of industrial action, staff shortages and other issues. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""RMT demands again today that this union be given access to exactly the same talks process in our Southern Rail disputes as has been brokered for our sister union by the TUC. ""We would remind all parties that not only is RMT a recognised drivers' union on Southern but that it is also our guards members who have made huge personal sacrifices in the long fight for passenger safety. ""The notion that some sort of deal can be done which leaves those Southern guards out in the cold is ludicrous. ""As a result of our exclusion from the talks process set up by the TUC and the Government both our guards and drivers' action remains on next week and we demand and expect a positive response to our fresh demand for a seat at the negotiating table."" A Southern spokesman said: ""The talks that are now taking place under the auspices of the TUC are as a result of a suggestion by ASLEF, which we welcomed and accepted in order to find a way to end their drivers' dispute. ""As we have stated, we are happy to have formal talks with the RMT too when they're ready to do so, and lines of communication with them are open. ""In the meantime, to show good faith, we would ask them to follow ASLEF's lead and suspend their one-day conductors' strike planned for next Monday."""

It is also seeking more staff for its online operations and looming branch openings - with 12 in the immediate pipeline. The lender currently has a branch network of 48 across London and southern England. While it remains a small player, it has attracted 900,000 customer accounts. Many of those people are likely to have been drawn in by its proposition of seven-day-a-week store opening - maybe even a pooch-friendly policy that includes free water and dog biscuits. Its ambition, at least, is in stark contrast to the closure of branches and dramatic shift towards online banking followed by bigger, and its biggest, rivals in the domestic market as they look to save costs and invest more digitally. It was announced only on Wednesday that Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks were shutting more than a third of branches with the loss of 400 jobs. While Airdrie Savings Bank, the UK's last remaining independent savings bank, said it was to close after 182 years with 70 jobs going. Both decisions were partly linked to the growth in mobile and internet banking but there is a wider issue for the sector in that retail banking profitability has been damaged by years of rock bottom interest rates - designed to help prop up the economy. Lenders have moved to bolster earnings through higher volumes - with credit provision at an 11-year high. :: Carney: Consumer-led growth may fizzle out Metro Bank, which listed on the London Stock Exchange almost a year ago with shares offered at a reduced price because of wider market turmoil, has seen its stock climb 47% in value since. It has outlined ambitious plans to achieve 110 branches by 2020 - with its expansion dragging on profitability to leave it loss-making on an annual basis since its launch. It made its first pre-tax trading profit, of £0.6m, in the third quarter of 2016."

Wilkins, from Littleport in Cambridgeshire, had arranged to pay the boy $250 (£200) at a flat he rented in the Coachella Valley. He had also tried to meet two other boys, aged 10 and 12, but was arrested in February after his plan failed. The pensioner initially faced charges of travelling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct and attempted sex trafficking of children, transporting child pornography and possession of child pornography. But after a plea deal, he admitted he had travelled to the US intending to have sex with the two young brothers and had sought out the other boy when that plan fell apart. Prosecutors said Wilkins ran an online group used by paedophiles. They added that he had ""persistently engaged in the sexual exploitation of children"" before he went to the US in January last year. United States Attorney Eileen Decker said: ""Today's sentence ensures that children will be protected from his abhorrent conduct for many years."" Wilkins also pleaded guilty to one charge of transporting child pornography from the UK to the US, including graphic sexual images of boys between the ages of five and eight. As well as his jail sentence, he was ordered to pay a $25,000 (£20,000) fine when he appeared at a Los Angeles court on Wednesday. He will also have to be supervised for the rest of his life. Joseph Macias, special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigation Los Angeles, which ran the sting, said: ""This sentence should ... serve as a sobering reminder to paedophiles who wrongly believe they can outrun the law and indulge their perverse desires by buying an airline ticket and boarding a plane."""

And she added that China, Brazil and the Gulf States had also expressed in interest in striking deals. It follows Donald Trump's suggestion that he would work ""quickly"" to reach a trade deal with the UK once it had left the EU and he wanted a deal done fast. The Prime Minister attempted to convince her international audience gathered in the Alpine resort that the Brexit vote was a desire of the British electorate to reach out beyond Europe to deal with the rest of the world. It struck a markedly different tone to her key Brexit speech in London on Tuesday when she told her UK audience: ""But the message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear: Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe."" However, Mrs May also sounded a stark warning on globalisation and urged leaders to ""listen to those left behind"". She cautioned of the ""sense among the public that mainstream political and business leaders have failed to comprehend their legitimate concerns for too long"". She said that Governments could help by intervening to make sure businesses doing well from globalisation shared the spoils. Mrs May added: ""...we must heed the underlying feeling that there are some companies, particularly those with global reach, who are playing by a different set of rules to ordinary, working people."" But Mrs May was warned by German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble that world leaders would not take her seriously if carried out her threat to turn the UK into a low-tax economy to make it a more attractive place to do business than the EU. The Prime Minister cautioned EU leaders on Tuesday that offering a Brexit punishment deal would be ""an act of calamitous self-harm"" and the UK would retaliate. Mr Schauble said slashing taxes would break a G20 agreement. Mrs May's speech came just hours after a blow to the City - as Europe's biggest bank HSBC announced plans to move 1,000 UK-based jobs to Paris in two years' time when Brexit comes into effect. The move will trigger fears about a wider exodus from the financial sector, which accounts for 12% of Britain's economy and employs over two million people. The chairman of Japanese carmaker Toyota has also expressed concern about its UK operation, which employs 3,000 people. However, the chief executive of Barclays Jes Staley told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't believe that the European financial centre will leave the City of London. ""I think the UK will continue to be the financial lungs for Europe. We may have to move certain activities... but I think it's going to be at the margin and will be manageable.""

2017-01-20,The British Army has secretly moved tanks through the Channel Tunnel to test the rail network in case of an invasion of Eastern Europe. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/army-moves-tanks-through-channel-tunnel-during-secret-exercise-10733660,"During the exercise on Tuesday night, five Challenger tanks were loaded on to trains and taken to France and back. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) attempted to keep the exercise quiet - no media were invited and a short tweet with a picture was sent out around midnight. The MoD denied a request for further photos or video, but said the exercise tested ""the viability of using the Channel Tunnel to move vehicles and equipment to mainland Europe, adding to the existing range of options available and increasing the agility of our Armed Forces"". The exercise has been some time in the planning and defence sources have told Sky News the Channel Tunnel rail line could be commandeered in a time of crisis. The British military has its own railway line that joins up with the national network, but the military uses a private contractor, Leidos, for movement through the Channel Tunnel. The exercise was part of a wider series of NATO operations across Europe, testing logistics and infrastructure. Recently, some 3,000 US soldiers landed in Germany en route to Poland. It is the biggest American deployment to Europe since the Cold War. Later this year, approximately 500 British troops will deploy to Estonia as part of a bigger NATO move into the Baltic states and Poland. Britain has just taken the lead of NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, headquartered in Paderborn, Germany. The task force is on standby to react to an attack on a NATO country within 48 hours. RAF Typhoons will also go to Romania for air defence in the next few months."

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said: ""People used to say it was a miracle between himself and Ian Paisley, God rest him, and whatever people may think of Martin McGuinness, I'm sure that most people would concede that for 10 years, he broke his back trying to make that office work."" Mr McGuinness joined the IRA in his teens and was convicted of possessing ammunition and explosives in the Irish Republic. He admits to having been the IRA's second-in-command, but denies the Bloody Sunday Inquiry finding that he was ""probably armed with a sub-machine gun"" on the day British troops shot 14 people dead. Recognising his influence, the British government flew him to London for secret talks in 1972 but the violence continued. He has repeatedly denied allegations he had advance knowledge of the Poppy Day bombing of Enniskillen's war memorial. Following the ceasefire, he was appointed Sinn Fein's chief negotiator in the talks which resulted in the Good Friday Agreement. A handshake between the Queen and Mr McGuinness was seen as one of the most symbolic acts of reconciliation but he knew his journey from guns to government involved risk. Mr McGuinness said: ""If there are people out there who are maliciously disposed towards my involvement in the peace process and they want bad enough to take my life, I'm around long enough to know that they have the ability to do that. ""Am I going to let that put me off in my work for peace? Not in a million years."" Already battling health issues, he resigned as deputy first minister earlier this month in protest at his coalition partner's handling of a costly botched renewable energy scheme.

At the time he said his health was not a factor - but his Sinn Fein colleague Gerry Adams admitted he was ""not well"". Mr McGuinness said today in a statement that it had always been his intention to step down in May - but his health and the political crisis engulfing the country had brought events to a head. He said: ""My obvious health issues are being addressed by a superb team of national health service doctors and nurses. ""But I want to be open and honest with my friends and colleagues in Sinn Fein, with the electorate of Foyle and with the wider community beyond my own constituency. ""I also want to be fair to my family and to the teams of carers who are doing their best to provide me with the treatment I now require to deal with this very serious medical condition which I am very determined to overcome. ""Unfortunately, I am not physically able to continue in my current role and have therefore decided to make way for a new leader. ""This election is the right time for me to move aside so I will not seek re-election to the Assembly."" :: Martin McGuinness: A journey from guns to government He later clarified that he was not leaving politics altogether and will remain a member of the national leadership of Sinn Fein. In his statement, Mr McGuinness said he was proud of those that had kept the Republican ""struggle"" alive over the generations, reaffirmed his ambition for a united Ireland and said he was optimistic about the future. ""We must continue to move forward. Dialogue is the only option,"" he added. When he resigned as deputy first minister on 9 January, Mr McGuinness called on then DUP first minister Arlene Foster to resign over her handling of the botched scheme that could have cost the taxpayer £400m. She refused, calling Mr McGuinness' actions ""not principled"" and ""purely political"". Earlier this week, their power-sharing government collapsed and a snap election was called. Following Mr McGuinness' retirement today, Ms Foster said: ""Despite all that has happened, I wish Martin McGuinness a speedy recovery and that he and his wife are able to enjoy time with their family away from the relentless focus of public life."" Taoiseach Enda Kenny also paid tribute to Mr McGuinness and ""readily acknowledged [his] remarkable politicaljourney"". ""He was one of the key architects of the Good Friday Agreement, and a tireless and committed champion of the peace process,"" he said. Former first minister Peter Robinson said he was praying for Mr McGuinness to overcome his illness. He said: ""I pray that he overcomes his health challenges and has the time to do the simple things I know he loves - spending time with his grandchildren, fishing and watching football."" Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We recognise his work over many years securing a number of significant political agreements.

2017-01-20,A woman who claims entertainer Rolf Harris groped her at a children's television show in the 1980s has told a court she told others about the assault but they did not believe her.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/woman-claims-rolf-harris-groped-her-after-episode-of-saturday-superstore-10733481,"The 86-year-old is alleged to have placed his hand on the breast of the teenager after a broadcast of Saturday Superstore at BBC Television Centre in White City, west London, in 1983. Giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, the complainant said Harris stood next to her in a room where others were ""milling about"", before he touched her. She told the court: ""He slid his hand under my breast and then said to me 'do you often get molested on a Saturday morning?' ""It was like a kind of cupping motion. I was in shock. ""It was the last thing I had expected to happen and I did not know really what to do. ""I was a bit in shock and couldn't move and he left quite quickly afterwards."" Speaking via video-link, she told the court that after the alleged incident she told another girl who was ""dismissive"" of the claim. She said she had told others during her life, but ""the reaction I got from people was sheer disbelief, so I thought 'if my friends don't believe me then the police won't believe me'."" Stephen Vullo, defending, said Harris ""has no memory of this event at all"" and questioned why the complainant had kept an autograph from Harris in a book after the alleged assault. She replied: ""I was quite shocked after the incident so again, even though it shocked me, the reaction I got from other people confused me into thinking that it maybe wasn't as bad as it was. ""But I knew myself that it was."" Harris, who followed proceedings by video-link, is serving a sentence at Stafford Prison for a series of indecent assaults on four female victims. He maintains his innocence, and has pleaded not guilty to a further seven counts of indecent assault and one alternative charge of sexual assault. The complainant said she came forward after the first trial, but denied she intended to claim for compensation. The trial continues."
2017-01-20,Italian search and rescue teams are engaged in a desperate race against time to free people trapped inside a remote hotel hit by an avalanche.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/hopes-fade-for-survivors-of-italian-avalanche-10735003,"The four-star Hotel Rigopiano was almost completely covered by the deluge late on Wednesday night in the remote, mountainous region. Rescuers had to use skis to reach the scene and gaining access since has proved extremely difficult for search and rescue teams. This region of Italy can be difficult to reach in good weather, let alone the kind of snowy conditions they have have faced in recent weeks. Many roads remain blocked by snow and hotels in the area have been completely booked by panic-stricken locals who fear there are more aftershocks to come. :: 'Help we are dying' - Texts from inside the avalanche-hit hotel in Italy Italy's prime minister Paolo Gentiloni has spoken to those leading the rescue operation and with the whole country watching on, he knows just how important the coming hours are. The hotel had 22 paying guests on Wednesday night and seven members of staff working, but locals say there were at least 35 people in there when the landslide came. Hopes of finding any survivors at the hotel are dwindling, with rescuers reporting no signs of life as they search for the estimated 30 people believed to have been trapped inside. Two bodies have been recovered so far. Antonio Crocetta, a member of the Alpine Rescue squad, told Reuters: ""The hotel is almost completely destroyed. ""We've called out but we've heard no replies, no voices. ""We're digging and looking for people."" Rescuers will ""continue to do everything possible during the night"" despite the difficult conditions, according to the Civil Protection department's chief Fabrizio Curcio. He said: ""There is always hope. ""If there was no hope, the rescuers wouldn't give everything they've got."" Rescuers had to ski through a blizzard to reach the site and have now set up a base camp in the town of Penne, about six miles away. Four powerful earthquakes struck the region on Wednesday but it is unclear whether any of these triggered the avalanche just hours later. The 300-metre wide snow slide uprooted trees and wiped out parts of the four-storey hotel, trapping dozens of people, including two children. There were two survivors - men who had been outside when disaster struck. Survivor Giampaolo Parete reportedly told doctors he escaped the avalanche because he left the hotel to fetch something from his car, but his wife and two children were still inside. The 38-year-old chef called his boss, restaurant owner Quintino Marcella, for help, saying: ""The hotel isn't there anymore. It's disappeared. It's buried."" Mr Marcella criticised the response, claiming no one took him seriously when he alerted authorities."
2017-01-20,Disability campaigners have welcomed a Supreme Court ruling that bus drivers may have to do more to accommodate wheelchair users.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/victory-for-people-with-disabilities-in-wheelchair-v-buggy-bus-case-10733248,"The case was brought by Doug Paulley, who said he was ""absolutely delighted"" after ""a long fight"" and that the judgment marked ""a significant cultural change"". Mr Paulley argued against FirstGroup's policy of ""requesting but not requiring"" non-disabled passengers, including those with buggies, to vacate a space if it is needed by a wheelchair user. The Supreme Court's president, Lord Neuberger, said the policy of simply ""requesting"" was unjustified. He said if a bus driver believes a person's refusal to give up a space is unreasonable they should consider a further step to pressurise the traveller, depending on circumstances. Those steps could, in appropriate cases, include ""a refusal to drive on"". Disability groups have been battling to get priority use for wheelchair users on buses and the latest ruling has been called a ""partial victory"". Mr Paulley, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, brought legal action after he tried unsuccessfully to board a FirstGroup bus which had a sign saying: ""Please give up this space if needed for a wheelchair user."" The driver asked a woman with a sleeping baby in a pushchair to move out of the designated area - but she refused, saying the buggy would not fold and Mr Paulley was left at the bus stop. A judge at Leeds County Court then ruled the policy breached FirstGroup's duty under the Equality Act 2010 to make ""reasonable adjustments"" for disabled people. Recorder Paul Isaacs said the policy should have ""required"" the woman to move and the wheelchair user's right to priority should have been enforced. But the judgment was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which ruled such a policy would not strike a fair balance between the needs of wheelchair users and the needs of other passengers who might be vulnerable. The policy would also be liable to give rise to confrontation and delayed journeys. Mr Paulley, in his late 30s, then continued his fight before seven justices at the UK's highest court. The Equality and Human Rights Commission, which supported Mr Paulley. said the Supreme Court decision was ""a victory for disabled people's rights"". And it said it was ""a hugely important decision, which has helped clarify the current state of the law, and will give confidence to thousands of disabled people in Britain to use public transport""."
2017-01-20,Surrey is to hold a referendum on increasing council tax by a massive 15% to pay for the growing crisis in social care.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/surrey-to-hold-referendum-on-15-council-tax-rise-to-fund-social-care-10734359,"It is expected that the decision could trigger other cash-strapped councils to follow suit in order to meet the growing cost of caring for people in their own homes after Theresa May refused to increase social care funding. A 15% increase by the Tory-controlled authority would add around £200 to the average bill and it is the first council to hold a vote on such a rise. It is particularly embarrassing for the Government because Surrey contains the constituency of the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is under fire because of the current NHS crisis gripping the country. As well as Mr Hunt, the county covers the constituencies of 11 Tory MPs including Chancellor Philip Hammond, former Justice Secretary Michael Gove, chair of the Foreign Affairs select committee Crispin Blunt and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. Mr Blunt said he supported the council's decision. He said: ""Until national funding is reviewed, councils are going to face unpalatable choices."" Mr Hammond had been tipped to include a boost for social care funding in his Autumn Statement but Number 10 has been accused of blocking it. The lack of funding sparked an outcry and in December Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said he would change the rules to allow local authorities to increase council tax by 5%, with 3% ring-fenced for adult social care.  The lack of social care services, particularly for the elderly, has been blamed for the current crisis in the NHS and Mrs May has been under increasing pressure to act. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""It's not right that we should thrust the social care crisis on local authorities, all of whom have different levels of income all over the country. ""It's a central government responsibility and the central government should face up to its responsibilities."" Surrey Council is already facing a budget shortfall of £45m and cannot afford to increase social care funding. Council leader David Hodge said: ""We have to set a budget that will protect vital services for Surrey residents. ""Government has cut our annual grant by £170m since 2010 - leaving a huge gap in our budget."" But a Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""If the council sets this proposed budget, then the taxpayers of Surrey will have the final say in a referendum in May. We should trust the people. ""Our long-term funding settlement means more spending power for Surrey County Council during this parliament, with £3.2bn to deliver the services that local people want."" The council has to put the increase to a county-wide vote because rules stipulate a local authority can only increase council tax by just under 5% unless the public agrees. The move will be widely viewed as a political manoeuvring because it is unlikely families will vote to see a £200 increase to the household bills. One Surrey Tory MP told Sky News that the county's MPs had been trying to broker a deal between Mr Javid and Mr Hodge but talks had failed. The MP said: ""They'll hold a referendum, lose, and then use it for cover to cut services."" Claire Kober, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's resources board, said: ""Services supporting the elderly and disabled are at breaking point. ""It cannot be left to council taxpayers alone to try and fix them. ""Only genuinely new additional government funding for social care will give councils any chance of protecting the services caring for our elderly and disabled.""

2017-01-20,"Labour is currently planning to hold two challenging by-elections on the same day in late February, Sky News has been told.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-planning-double-by-election-on-23-february-10734971,"The current thinking of the party leadership is to hold the contests in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copelands within weeks, on 23 February, rather than hold off until May as some have suggested. The party believes its best hope of seeing off the Conservatives and UKIP is to ""get them over with"", said a source familiar with the discussions. Both seats have been vacated by the resignations of MPs critical of Jeremy Corbyn to take jobs outside politics - in areas which voted overwhelmingly for Brexit and where Labour's divisions on immigration will be exploited. Jamie Reed, the Labour MP for Copeland, said he was ""heartbroken"" to quit after 12 years as an MP just before Christmas to take a job at the Sellafield nuclear plant in the constituency. He kept the seat in 2015 with a majority of 2,564 over the Tories, who are already handing out leaflets to voters - many of them Sellafield staff - highlighting Mr Corbyn's opposition to nuclear power. Last night the local party selected councillor Gillian Troughton as its candidate, defeating the pro-Corbyn favourite Rachel Holliday. Tristram Hunt, the former shadow education secretary, will become director of the V&A Museum after just six years as an MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, he announced last week.  His seat - held by Labour since its creation in 1950 - will be a major electoral test for UKIP, whose leader Paul Nuttall is rumoured to be announcing his candidacy this weekend. The seat - which used to be an industrial powerhouse but has seen traditional industries decline - saw a strong showing from UKIP in May 2015, finishing just over 5,000 votes behind Labour. It will be a three-way fight between UKIP, Labour and the Conservatives, who finished a close third in the General Election. But the result could be decided by how hard the Conservatives choose to campaign. Recent by-elections in Richmond Park and Sleaford in Lincolnshire have seen the Labour vote splinter between Remainers turning to the pro-European Lib Dems and Leave voters backing UKIP. :: Why Tristram Hunt won't be the last to leave Corbyn's Labour Some Labour MPs believe Copeland is the more winnable seat for the party, given Mr Reed's long record as a local campaigner and concern about cuts to NHS services. Mr Hunt warned about the challenge of Brexit on Wednesday in his farewell speech to the House of Commons, saying: ""I represent a constituency that voted 70-30 to Leave the European Union. ""This division of opinion between the official Labour Party position and many of our heartland voters has served only to highlight some of the deep-seated challenges which centre-left parties are facing. ""What Brexit has done is exacerbate the divergence of priorities between what the Labour voters of Cambridge want, and those in Redcar, Grimsby or Stoke-on-Trent. Keeping a metropolitan and post-industrial coalition together is no easy task."" Parliamentary convention says the chief whip of the party to which the departing MP belongs moves the writ that calls a by-election. A Labour spokesperson said: ""The writ has not yet been moved so this is speculation""."
2017-01-20,Theresa May is set to reveal more details about her strategy for leaving the EU in a major speech on Tuesday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/single-market-customs-union-your-guide-to-brexit-jargon-10729833,"The Prime Minister is expected to announce the UK is prepared to leave the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice. Here's a glossary of some of the key terms you're likely to hear in the next few days. :: Single market An association of countries trading with each other without restrictions or tariffs. The European single market came into effect in 1993. It accounts for 25% of global GDP and is Britain’s biggest trading partner. Currently, 45% of the UK's exports are to the EU while 50% of imports are from the EU. Access to the single market is based on countries signing up to the core principle of the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. :: Customs union A group of states that have agreed to charge the same import duties as each other and usually to allow free trade between themselves. The customs union reduces administrative and financial trade barriers such as customs checks and charges and boosts economic cooperation. The advantages of leaving the customs union are that Britain would not have to pay contributions to Brussels - in 2015 it paid £13bn into the EU, according to the Treasury - and would not have to sign up to the free movement rule. The Government would also be able to negotiate free trade deals with non-EU countries. The disadvantages are that though the UK could still trade with EU countries, it would face tariffs and vice-versa which could push up the cost of goods and services. The UK will also have to negotiate new trading deals with the EU which all member countries would have to agree to. :: European Economic Area The area that provides the free movement of people, services and capital within the European single market. Membership is open to member states of either the EU or the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). EFTA states which are party to the European Economic Area Agreement participate in the EU's internal market without being members of the EU. However, they must adopt most EU legislation concerning the single market except on laws concerning agriculture and fisheries. :: European Court of Justice This is the judicial institution of the EU. It deals with disputes between parties and ensures that European law is interpreted and applied in the same way in every member state. It has been argued that leaving the EU would mean human rights encapsulated by the European Court of Human Rights would be adversely affected on matters such as employment rights. Brexiters say it interferes with British justice and that the UK is already bound by common law which makes provisions for fundamental rights. They also point out that the UK is signed up to European Convention of Human Rights, which existed long before the EU and is entirely independent of it. :: World Trade Organisation The global organisation that deals with rules of trade between nations. WTO agreements are negotiated and signed by most of the world's trading nations. Britain joined the WTO as a member of the EU and it is expected that it would have to negotiate new and updated terms of its membership. This could be a long process because the UK would need all the other WTO members to agree on these terms. The Treasury has also warned that this so-called hard Brexit option could cut the UK’s GDP by 9.5% and trigger a loss of tax revenues of £66bn a year under WTO rules."

Samantha Leek QC, counsel to the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, said: ""Some of the families in court yesterday were understandably upset during the course of the reading of Camilla Bekkevold's statement. ""I apologise that we had not warned that that potentially distressing material was coming."" The statement said: ""I could see a man lying down, apparently being treated by medical people. ""I got closer and saw that he had a severe head injury and they were not treating him, but getting his body ready to take him away. ""I then saw other bodies. There was a lot of commotion.""

UK military chiefs are now facing a dressing down over the unapproved landing on 29 December which has been described as a ""total affront to Irish sovereignty"" and ""utterly shocking"". British diplomats told Irish officials there had been a ""communication breakdown"" and there are set to be more discussions to make sure ""correct procedures are followed in future"". As Ireland is a neutral country, permission should have been sought beforehand. And assurances should have been given that the aircraft had no weapons, ammunition or explosives and was not on an intelligence-gathering mission or a military exercise or operation. The British Embassy in Dublin has since told Irish officials that the Hercules was unarmed, was not gathering intelligence or on an exercise or operation and landed in Shannon to refuel. Ireland's foreign affairs minister Charlie Flanagan said: ""The government views breaches of the procedures set down for the granting of permission for such landings with the utmost seriousness. ""I have instructed my officials to discuss the matter further with the British embassy with a view to ensuring that correct procedures are followed in future."" Twenty-one other RAF flights followed the correct procedures to land in Ireland last year. Clare Daly, an Independent politician from Dublin, revealed the information in a parliamentary question and called for closer scrutiny of NATO planes in Ireland. Ms Daly, who campaigns against the use of Shannon by foreign military including the US, said: ""It is utterly shocking that a foreign military aircraft landed without permission from the department of foreign affairs on Irish soil. ""This is a total affront to our sovereignty and any notion of neutrality. ""The minister should be before the Dail (Irish parliament), apologising and assuring us of the measures he has put in place to prevent a recurrence."""

Mr Assange welcomed the move to release the ex-US soldier who was imprisoned for handing over classified documents to the anti-secrecy organisation. The transgender former intelligence analyst, who was born Bradley Manning, said she passed on government and military documents to raise awareness about the impact of war. Mr Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 and believes if he leaves he would face being extradited to the US for questioning over WikiLeaks' activities. Speaking on social media from the embassy, he signalled there would be ""many discussions"" on his future before Manning's release. In November, Mr Assange was questioned in the building by prosecutors from Sweden, where he faces a sex allegation. He denies the claims. More follows..."
2017-01-20,"After delivering a difficult message, delicately and diplomatically, pretty much the last thing the PM would have wanted is an offensive gaffe from her top diplomat.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnsons-hollande-gaffe-distracts-from-pms-brexit-speech-10733844,"So Number 10 spent part of the post-Prime Minister's Questions briefing defending Boris Johnson - who compared French President Francois Hollande to someone ""who wants to administer punishment beatings to anyone who chooses to escape in the manner of some WW2 movie"". Downing Street said the Foreign Secretary's ""theatrical"" comparison ""was in no way suggesting that anyone was a Nazi"", pointing to the reaction to Mr Johnson as an example of what Theresa May had criticised yesterday as a ""hyped-up media report"". Mr Johnson had, during the referendum debate, made a Nazi analogy in relation to the EU, causing widespread consternation in European capitals. Mentioning World War Two is almost diametrically the opposite of where the PM wants her negotiations to go. European capitals see the EU as a method through which wars on the continent have been avoided. Yesterday's speech did much to repair some of the damage caused across Europe by the tone of speeches at the Conservative Party conference. The row over Mr Johnson's comments also distracted from a confident performance from the PM after her historic speech on leaving the single market. Theresa May knew what she was getting when she appointed her brief rival for the Tory leadership as Foreign Secretary. At her campaign launch she joked that Boris' last negotiation in Germany (as London Mayor) was for two unused water cannon. Things have come along way since then. Mr Johnson injected his trademark ""positivity"" into her Single Market speech. Number 10 said it has ""full confidence"" in the Foreign Secretary, and that he was doing good work in India. There has been no response from the Elysee Palace so far. The EU Parliament's current negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said his comments were ""abhorrent and deeply unhelpful"" and called on Mrs May to condemn them. She did not. Against a backdrop of elections in France, such interventions risk raising already high temperatures over Brexit that Mrs May appeared to be cooling. But right now Number 10 have got bigger issues to worry about."
2017-01-20,"Number 10 has insisted Boris Johnson was just making a ""theatrical comparison"" when he likened the French President to a World War Two guard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-dismisses-world-war-two-punishment-threat-10733123,"The Foreign Secretary had warned Francois Hollande not to hit the UK with World War Two-style ""punishment beatings"" for leaving the EU. His comments were condemned as ""crass"", ""abhorrent"" and ""wild and inappropriate"", but a spokeswoman for Theresa May insisted he had not been comparing the French President to a Nazi. Mr Johnson had been responding to comments that Mr Hollande would not be prepared to give the UK a better deal outside the single market than it had in it. He said: ""If Monsieur Hollande wants to administer punishment beatings to anybody who chooses to escape, rather in the manner of some World War 2 movie, then I don't think that that is the way forward and I don't think it's in the interests of our friends and partners."" A senior Labour spokesman said: ""We are all aware that the Foreign Secretary has a habit of making wild and inappropriate comments. ""Talking about World War Two in that context is another one of those and that is not going to be something that is going to improve the climate for this negotiation."" The Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the remarks were an ""utterly crass and clueless remark from the man who is supposed to be our chief diplomat"". European Parliament Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt tweeted: ""Yet more abhorrent & deeply unhelpful comments from Boris Johnson which PM May should condemn."" But a spokeswoman for Mrs May condemned the reports of Mr Johnson's comments as ""hyped up"". She said: ""He was making a point. He was in no way suggesting that anyone was a Nazi."" She added: ""There is not a Government policy of not mentioning the war."" During the EU referendum campaign, Mr Johnson came under fire for comparing the aims of the EU to those of Adolf Hitler. Mr Johnson made his comments after the Prime Minister warned EU leaders in her key Brexit speech that offering a bad deal to punish the UK for its decision to leave the EU would be ""an act of calamitous self-harm"". Mrs May said if the UK was offered a bad exit deal she would be prepared to move to a low-tax economy to make the country a more attractive place to do business than the EU. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Wednesday that while the negotiations would be ""very, very difficult"" EU leaders were ""not hostile"" to the UK. He said he had spoken to Mrs May after her speech on Tuesday. Mr Juncker said: ""We want a fair deal with Britain and a fair deal for Britain, but a fair deal means a fair deal for the European Union too.""

Sir Paul, 74, will soon be able to start reclaiming the rights under US copyright law - but court papers suggest he is worried about a legal challenge. The papers state: ""[The] Defendants have attempted to reserve their rights to challenge Paul McCartney's exercise of his termination rights on contractual ground. It adds: ""A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time so that Paul McCartney can rely on quiet, unclouded title to his rights."" The original rights to the songs - written by Lennon and McCartney between 1962 and 1971 - were sold to ATV Music in 1968 after the death of the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein. The catalogue was famously bought in a $47.5m (£38.7m) deal by Michael Jackson in 1985 and later sold on to Sony/ATV following the star's death in 2009. Sony/ATV told US magazine Rolling Stone it was ""disappointed"" by the lawsuit and described it as ""both unnecessary and premature"". The publisher said: ""Sony/ATV has the highest respect for Sir Paul McCartney with whom we have enjoyed a long and mutually rewarding relationship with respect to the treasured Lennon and McCartney song catalogue. ""We have collaborated closely with both Sir Paul and the late John Lennon's Estate for decades to protect, preserve and promote the catalogue's long-term value."""
2017-01-20,The Labour leader says he will order party MPs to vote to trigger Brexit negotiations after suggestions some may seek to block it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20170120050825/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-to-order-mps-to-vote-to-trigger-article-50-10734496,"Jeremy Corbyn said the party ""respects the decision of the British people"" to leave the European Union and ""we will not block Article 50"". He said his MPs would be asked to vote to officially trigger Article 50, which will start Brexit negotiations with the EU and set the clock ticking on the two-year departure deadline. :: What is Tuesday's Article 50 Supreme Court Case about? The Supreme Court is expected to rule on Tuesday on whether the Prime Minister must get the backing of Parliament before she can formally notify the EU that Britain is leaving and open discussions. However, some MPs are said to be prepared to vote to block triggering Article 50, despite the Labour party's official position that it will not do so. One shadow cabinet minister told The Guardian newspaper: ""I'm concerned that if we wave Article 50 through, my constituents will go crazy."" Another said: ""When the pain hits, as it will, and when people lose their jobs, you need to be on the right side of that. I don't think we should vote to trigger Article 50."" Responding to the reports, Mr Corbyn said: ""I've made it very clear the Labour Party accepts and respects the decision on British people. ""We will not block Article 50. ""It means all Labour MPs will be asked to vote in that direction next week, whenever the vote comes up."" The suggested three-line whip will be a big test for the party's Chief Whip Nick Brown. Sky News has been told the ""most likely"" option to come before MPs will be a two-clause bill that would give permission to trigger Article 50. However, a number of MPs have said they want to see more of the Prime Minister's negotiating points built into the legislation. Following Mrs May's speech on Tuesday in which she laid out her 12-point plan for the leaving the EU, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News: ""What we need now is to fill in the gaps, we need to unpick the inconsistencies and I think that means we need a plan in parliament. ""We need to make sure that the Article 50 legislation is amended to ensure that those objectives are delivered.""

Mr Barrow won an election in December, but President Yahya Jammeh, who has been in power for more than two decades, has refused to step down despite a midnight deadline. He claims there were irregularities in the election and does not accept the result. :: Jammeh: 'Gifted leader' who claimed to cure AIDS Troops from Senegal and other West African countries are poised to cross the border with the intention of forcing him to give up power. Mr Barrow was a political unknown a matter of months ago, but was thrust into the limelight when eight opposition parties put him forward as a unifying figure. The 51-year-old lived in Britain for three-and-a-half years when he was younger, and worked at an Argos in London. Thousands of Gambians have fled across the border to Senegal to escape a possible conflict, including a number of former cabinet ministers who have resigned in recent days. Nigeria has deployed fighter jets and surveillance planes to Senegal, while Ghana has also pledged to contribute to the regional force. The Gambia's army chief has said his troops will not fight the entry of outside forces. Thousands of British tourists have also been caught up in the crisis, and they have started to arrive back in the UK from The Gambia. With fears that the turmoil could see Banjul airport close at short notice, holiday companies put plans into place to fly thousands of Britons home. Thomas Cook said it had 985 package tourists and 2,500 ""flight-only"" customers in the West African country and it expects to have brought them all back - on 16 flights - by the end of Friday. Among those who arrived overnight on Wednesday was Sara Wilkins, from Church Stretton, Shropshire, who said: ""We just panicked, just threw everything in a case and just got out of there, basically. ""It was a nightmare at the airport - people were crying and panicking. It was just chaos."" Ebrima Jagne is from The Gambia, where he lives with his wife and three-month-old daughter, but he works in the UK. He arrived at Manchester Airport late on Wednesday and told Sky News he had to leave his family behind. ""I'm really desperate ... I feel so sad that I have to leave my daughter and my wife and members of my family and I don't know what's going to come next."""
